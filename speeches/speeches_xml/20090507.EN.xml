      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report (A6-0260/2009) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries MEDIA Mundus (COM(2008)0892 – C6-0011/2009 – 2008/0258(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time – just six months – and before the end of this legislative period.</p>
      <p sl="de">This was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The Commission’s proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one. There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all. Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time.</p>
      <p sl="de">The promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years. Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme. So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are new opportunities, but also new challenges. The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response. It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe. It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films themselves to support and drive forward intercultural dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I should like to express my thanks that the pilot MEDIA Mundus projects were launched. EUR 7 million were made available. It became clear that there was huge demand. Training, marketing and distribution in global networks were supported by the pilot projects and, in particular, the emerging audiovisual markets of the world – India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada – have submitted outstanding projects.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, with the vote of the Committee on Culture and Education we gladly vote in favour of the proposal. I should like to ask the entire Parliament for a ‘yes’ vote to support this programme for the coming years with an appropriate amount of funding to achieve the objective of supporting the promotion of European films as global ambassadors for our cultural values.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is my last speech in the European Parliament. I feel very lucky to have been able to complete the programme with your support and should like to pass on my own message. Where future work is concerned, please remember that cultural goods in Europe should not be simply economic goods but must remain both cultural and economic goods.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should especially like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Culture and Education, in the secretariats, and you, Commissioner, and your Director General at the helm, Gregory Paulger, for ten years of excellent cooperation in the audiovisual field. Many thanks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I could not agree more with what Ms Hieronymi has said, and those 10 years of working together with her and with other Members of the Committee on Culture and Education were very efficient and, from a personal point of view, very enriching. So, thanks to you all, from whatever parties, who have really been working for culture to become important and culture to be able to speak to the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very glad that Parliament made some proposals on the report, which are clarifications and simplifications, so they improved the proposal which I had put on the table.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the preparatory action MEDIA International has been the basis in order to develop MEDIA Mundus and, in this context, I am also grateful to Parliament for giving me EUR 2 million in 2008 and EUR 5 million in 2009 to finance preparatory action.</p>
      <p sl="en">MEDIA Mundus will start in 2011 and will follow on from MEDIA International. It aims at strengthening cultural and commercial relations between European film industry professionals and those from all over the world. The concept of MEDIA Mundus is new, ambitious and innovative, because it promotes cooperation between professionals, which is not done normally by European programmes, and, unlike existing programmes, it is also based on mutual benefit, not only for our film-makers but also for film-makers from third countries, in different fields. The first one is training, including trainees and trainers from European and third countries. It will improve access to third-country markets and build trust and long-term commercial relationships: this is normal. When you have been sitting together at school, training for the film industry, with somebody from Asia, somebody from Africa or from the Americas, it is clear that, later on in your professional life, you have an impetus to work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is also why we support the organisation of forums for international co-productions. We train them together, and then we expect those professionals start to work together. So we need the forums for international co-productions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then we have to improve the distribution, circulation and visibility of European audiovisual arts in third countries. That is always a win-win situation for people from third countries within Europe. Here is a very good example of a Europe which is not a fortress Europe but an open Europe, a Europe which gives, which takes, which shares.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to improve public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content, which will be very important, so we have to get the youth, the young public most of all, to see European films.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very confident that MEDIA Mundus will increase consumer choice, so that people will have the possibility to watch European films. It will bring cultural diversity to European markets by getting more quality films from smaller markets outside Europe into Europe, and it will give a chance to European films on the international market. So it will create new business opportunities for professionals from Europe and around the globe. This is, of course, a very important economic contribution. It is a question of competitiveness, but it is most of all a question of cultural diversity – our cultural diversity – which is our most precious good, and the cultural diversity of those who live in other continents, which is their most special good. To share those is a wonderful chance, which will be built up by MEDIA Mundus.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Hieronymi, the MEDIA Mundus programme is a project based on an idea originating in our Committee, the Committee on Culture and Education. That is where it saw the light of day, so to speak. Above all, we gave it our strong backing and it of course bears the hallmark not only of the commissioner but also of Mrs Hieronymi, whom all of us on the Committee on Culture and Education were glad to support.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have learned a great deal from the Erasmus Mundus project, which opened the door for our students wishing to go to third countries and vice versa. In the context of globalisation, this is actually necessary, and MEDIA Mundus goes in the same direction with regard to film-makers. It is a wonderful example of how one can organise an intercultural dialogue in this field, which has a commercial aspect of course, but which is also, and above all, a cultural dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="de">MEDIA Mundus will also support and implement the UNESCO Convention promoting cultural diversity in Europe and across the globe, establishing dialogue and striking a balance between economic and economical interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">With MEDIA Mundus we of course strengthen the mobility of our films, film-makers and students and, in the end, what Wim Wenders keeps reminding us to do happens, namely we give Europe a new face, we turn the European dream into reality. The American dream has been conveyed to us through films for decades, and this is still the case today. If we eventually go so far as to bring the European dream to the world in cooperation with third countries, through images, we will have done much more to stabilise the European Union than we could have done in many other ways.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we work together in today’s globalised world, we will be able to drive the Americans back on the world market to some extent and portray our dream a little better. I am sure we will be supported by third countries, perhaps South Korea or countries of South America, which we in fact want to help by making their small-scale productions become more visible on the European market.</p>
      <p sl="de">All in all, this is a project that helps all sides. It helps the third countries and the European film industry. It was high time this happened. MEDIA Mundus is, in my view, the appropriate response to global technical and socio-economic challenges. I should like to end by saying: ‘What helps our diversity will strengthen our identity’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Hieronymi, I should like to extend my sincere congratulations on this report. All of us on the Committee on Culture and Education can be pleased and proud of what we have accomplished in such a short time. We have demonstrated that we can work flexibly and that we are not bound by procedure but pay due regard to the concerns of those who work in the film industry and who are urgently waiting for this policy to be successfully concluded. We have speeded up our work and we will still be able to work after the policy has been adopted and the resolution has been passed. We have not insisted on a reading. Those who constantly criticise our work and malign the positive things we have done should bear this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that, in the year of creativity and innovation, we are helping the creative to be more innovative and enabling them to further their training and become more globally integrated. In the digital world, everything changes day by day, technology is different and there are new resources and new challenges. It is therefore necessary to create another network. This needs the financial support we are giving. If we want to further the growth of our European film industry and promote the idea of Europe, we not only need better quality, which is already very good but could be even better, but we must also give our creative artists financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">With the economic crisis on everyone’s lips, creating new jobs in the film industry, enabling innovation, improving information sharing, research and market research is a contribution to creating jobs. There is huge potential here for enriching the job market.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as cross-border cooperation and dissemination in third countries are concerned, I should like to give an example. For me, Slumdog Millionaire is an example of success. This film, which went around the world, was supported by the MEDIA Mundus programme to the tune of EUR 830 000 and became a global success; it made us more aware of an emergency situation in a particular country. However it also showed what it means when we cooperate on a cross-border basis. That is why I think this programme is an excellent programme and I am pleased that we completed it without any problems in such a short time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should especially like to thank Mrs Hieronymi and wish her all the best. She has been an excellent colleague and media expert. Thank you, Mrs Hieronymi, and all the best.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the objective of the MEDIA 2007 programme was to preserve European identity, diversity and cultural heritage, to improve the circulation of European audiovisual works and to increase the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector. The MEDIA Mundus programme goes further and hopes that mutual benefits will come from the promotion and opening up of audiovisual markets in both the European Union and in third countries. This is, of course, a good concept.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This subject, however, leads us to reflect on something else. I am thinking about Europe’s cultural influence in the world – that influence seems to be getting smaller, and this worries me greatly. I notice, too, that our continent does not participate in intercultural dialogue as an equal partner. The Christian traditions which shaped Europe are generally being questioned today, and it seems that Europe does not have another conception of its own identity. Therefore it is no surprise that it is losing. Europe’s small share in the worldwide circulation of audiovisual works is a significant example of this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We may lament the fact that, along with its diminishing economic significance, Europe’s role will be still smaller. However, we do not have to rend our garments. Initiatives like the programme we are discussing are a small but necessary step. Furthermore, the next five years of the European Parliament lie before us, and we hope that the MEPs of the next term will make Europe’s voice more audible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The last sitting, the last speech – I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members for their cooperation, and in particular the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, with whom I worked on a daily basis. I congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on her report. Thank you, all of you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, our culture and media policy is about giving Europe a soul.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been quite rightly established, by Commission President Barroso amongst others, that people will not fall in love with the internal market – as important as it is – but want to see and enjoy cultural diversity, the cultural heritage of Europe. They also want cultural diversity to be the ambassador of Europe in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Pack was quite right when she said, using a sentence of Wim Wenders, that we need European images to tell European stories, to express the diversity of European history and of European sensibilities. What was the tragedy of European history, and what are the great hopes of a peaceful and better future? That is the basic cultural understanding of the European Union, which we not only want to cultivate internally but also need to convey to the outside world. That is why European culture policy, and film policy in particular, is always an ambassador for European identity. That is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to say from the outset that, in the next parliamentary term, this programme must be extended, invigorated and injected with more finances, so that the MEDIA Mundus programme can really fulfil its role of making it clear, in international cooperation, what European values are and what European cultural diversity is. There must also be co-productions, collaboration, training in the best sense of the word, a win-win situation which enriches both sides. In this age of globalisation and digitalisation it will be the trademark of European policy on culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hieronymi for her very good cooperation and for succeeding in making it clear in this House that, while culture has an economic side, it is always more than just a commodity. It is really about identity, diversity, cultural confrontation – in the best sense of the word. Because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds. Placing more trust in Europe than hitherto must be our obligation for the future. For that reason, Mrs Hieronymi, I extend my sincerest thanks for your good cooperation and wish you all the best for the future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and wish her many more years of success. The development of the international audiovisual environment deserves our attention because this is an interesting field of activity and it opens up a large space for cooperation within the European Union and also with other countries in the world. A further deepening of this cooperation, including the EUR 15 million budget for MEDIA 2011-2013, will broaden the choice for consumers and will bring more culturally diverse products into the European and international market. At the same time it will aid mutual understanding between peoples with different cultural traditions. Other very valuable aspects of these EU projects include the ongoing training courses for professionals in the audiovisual field, the varied promotional activities focusing on cinema, and the opportunities for increased circulation of films. It is also obvious that the audiovisual field is primarily the domain of the younger generation, who use television and devices operating via Internet protocols and multichannel digital television as one of their basic sources of information, together with other Internet technologies. The support of these systems through the EU project may therefore help to improve the quality of service for these users.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In this context I would, however, like to emphasise something else which I consider to be of key importance. All the Internet media represent an unrestricted alternative to traditional means of communication. Unfortunately, even in democratic societies, these traditional means of communication often fail because of commercial interests or because their management belongs to a particular political milieu and indirectly obliges employees to practice self-censorship. Because of this, much information reaches its audience in distorted or selective form. In contrast, the huge spread of the Internet, and the films and information which it disseminates, offers a genuinely independent, pluralistic media environment free of monopolies and cartels. We therefore need to support all projects which strengthen this alternative to the mainstream media world, and I am glad the Czech Presidency has contributed towards the successful accomplishment of the MEDIA Mundus project.</p>

      <p sl="sl">With the MEDIA Mundus programme, we are on the right path to promoting European film and European knowledge more effectively. Film is a medium which enables us to record, preserve, portray and sell Europe’s cultural diversity. However, given the rapid pace of development of modern technologies, we also need continuous education and training. It would be a pity if some third countries or less-developed continents were to stop making films depicting their people’s lives, interesting stories about them, and, of course, their own natural and cultural heritage and history, just because they lag behind in development and lack knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Because of the dominance of US film, which commands a huge market, European film has a tougher job competing in the world market, despite the fact that it has far more qualities than many a US tear-jerker or blockbuster. This is why MEDIA Mundus is a good platform for forging contacts with film-makers and distributors in third countries and for exchanging film-related knowledge and information. By the same token, in this field, the European Union fulfils the function of bringing different continents together and uniting film-goers from various countries, as well.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We will be gaining a new, successful programme, but losing our rapporteur and an expert in this field. I should like to pay my personal compliments to you, Mrs Hieronymi, for all the work you have done, for the breadth of your vision and for your cooperation. When I entered Parliament as a new member five years ago, Mrs Hieronymi was the first person I turned to for advice and information, and she was always prepared to offer help and understanding. So, once again, allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you and wish you happiness in your family life, and in your professional life, because I know that you will not be putting your feet up in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Some of you know that you will be coming back. I would like to come back, too, but I do not know whether or not that will happen. Allow me, therefore, to express my thanks, here and now, to all the members of the Committee, the Bureau and Parliament for giving me the opportunity to work on the Committee on Culture and Education. It has been enjoyable and pleasant working for you. Regardless of our political affiliations, we have worked to benefit culture, education, young people and sportsmen and -women. Furthermore, despite the fact that I come from a small country, my ideas have been taken up by the Committee and were later also confirmed by Parliament. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Universal Declaration of UNESCO on Cultural Diversity recommends that, among other things, we promote the making of high-quality audiovisual productions, particularly fostering the creation of cooperation mechanisms allowing us to distribute those productions; the European Commission has clearly borne this statement in mind when drawing up this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="es">It goes without saying that MEDIA Mundus will take advantage of the growing interest and opportunities created by worldwide cooperation in the audiovisual industry and will widen the range of possibilities for consumers, bringing products that are more culturally diverse to European and international markets and creating new commercial opportunities for audiovisual professionals in Europe and around the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is my conviction, and we should be in no doubt, that the Commission is capable of managing the budget so that this has the greatest impact possible and does not fade away into separate projects. As a prestigious professor said, the MEDIA Mundus programme for audiovisual cooperation with third countries is proof that the international audiovisual landscape has changed considerably, particularly in technological terms. This initiative aims to develop opportunities for cooperation in the audiovisual market, boosting research and training as well as financing coproduction projects in order to boost cooperation between audiovisual professionals.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also wish to finish by expressing my gratitude. It has been a pleasure working with all my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education for these past two years. Thank you, see you soon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi and to the Committee on Culture and Education. The worldwide development of the European film industry is made possible thanks to this new MEDIA Mundus programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, this programme is rooted in a policy. It was created under the MEDIA International action which, since 2007, has focused on the development of the European Union’s relations with the audiovisual markets of third countries. The aim of this action was to meet the immediate needs of third countries and to improve the overall effectiveness of MEDIA 2007. It was important to address the new problems and challenges resulting from the globalisation of markets, which affects the European audiovisual sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This preparatory action thus paved the way for a European Union programme of extended aid promoting global cooperation in the audiovisual industry. Then, very quickly, the European Commission – which I congratulate – adopted a proposal to establish the MEDIA Mundus programme. With a budget of EUR 15 million for the period 2011-2013, the programme will offer new possibilities for international cooperation and networking – and this concept of networking is extremely important – among audiovisual professionals from the European Union and from third countries. Audiovisual media are very popular among young people. They make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue, and the task, here too, is to establish new global balances in this sector between the United States and between other continents, which are major producers, and Europe, which has its rightful place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The programme is open to partnership-based projects involving a minimum of three partners, with each partnership being coordinated by a professional from the European Union. Developing information sharing, training and a sound knowledge of markets, improving the competitiveness and transnational distribution of audiovisual works worldwide, improving the circulation and exposure of audiovisual works worldwide, and increasing public demand for cultural diversity – all of this is covered in this programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We support the European Commission’s proposal, as it means that this consensual programme that we have arrived at can be implemented. I am full of hope for this text; I endorse it because it is in keeping with my firmly held beliefs about respect, about intercultural dialogue, and about providing support for creative work, for training and for the audiovisual industry, and I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi. I know that, in the next parliamentary term, we will owe it to her to continue to work along these lines.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal on the MEDIA Mundus programme is welcomed by everyone who wants to see the European audiovisual sector grow, become stronger and more competitive and export to the rest of the world. The European audiovisual industry has developed and improved considerably over recent years and its international profile has changed over the last 20 years, especially as a result of technological progress. This has resulted in intense economic development and investment and, as a result, an increased demand for audiovisual material on certain markets. Unfortunately, however, there are obstacles which affect the marketing of European works abroad, including inadequate funding for European audiovisual companies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Community support for the audiovisual sector takes account of the fact that the European Union and its Member States promote cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the cultural sector, because it underlines the importance of respect for different cultural dimensions, so as to promote diversity and, finally, because the distribution sector determines the diversity of audiovisual works and consumer choices. There are still few European audiovisual works available on the international market, while audiovisual works from third countries, excluding US works, face similar problems of limited availability on the European markets. European distributors are basically small companies with limited means of obtaining access to international markets. Consequently, the new programme makes funds available so that measures can be taken to improve the distribution, marketing and promotion of European audiovisual works in third countries and, by extension, of third countries in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on yet another exceptional piece of work and to wish her well in her personal life and in her future role, following her exceptional presence in the European Parliament. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Reding and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed during this five-year term.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The field of culture definitely contributes to achieving economic objectives, taking into account that there are roughly 5.8 million people employed in it. However, it also contributes to achieving social objectives through the promotion of the European Union’s values throughout the world, not to mention extending consumers’ opportunities for choice, and through boosting the audiovisual industry’s competitiveness in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The programme in question is also relevant because it takes into account the impact of technological developments in the field, all the more so as an ever-increasing demand for audiovisual content has actually been generated. I welcome a coherent programme for promoting European audiovisual works worldwide, given the fragmentation of the market at European level, compared to the audiovisual industry in the United States, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I firmly believe that better use will be made of the added value generated by the film industry in Member States. I can give you the example of the film industry in my country, Romania, which has proved itself up until now through the major prizes won at European and global level.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentleman, I have been working in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for five years. However, based on the experience of my own country, Lithuania, I must emphasise the importance of the programmes you are debating for a country’s economy, not to mention the culture of a small country.</p>
      <p sl="lt">A few years ago our film industry was in the doldrums. It was cooperation with third countries which helped get it back on its feet again. During that period Lithuania’s film industry grew stronger, established an economic base and now makes a significant contribution to job creation. At the same time, this has created the right environment for the emergence of talented directors and today Lithuania’s film directors are receiving international awards, and are well known throughout Europe and the world.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Therefore, I would like to stress that the European Union should pay more attention to the implementation of such programmes, as they help countries and cultures flourish.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you have succeeded once again in completing this project; it is an important project, but it must be weighed against the importance given to it, and it certainly does not match your ambitions in terms of financing. Provision will therefore have to be made, for the next financial perspective, to increase the resources for this programme. These people, who travel, must be granted every available possibility and freedom, and it is in this connection that we still too often run into unresolved problems concerning visas, social security and artistic status. Much still remains to be done to make artists truly mobile.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the rest, I believe that film is the best vehicle for cultural diversity. We should therefore support this sector, which is still in its infancy. Perhaps the existing idea of a guarantee fund could be the way to shore up the finances, which fall slightly short of our ambitions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, films from third countries are fairly often distributed in Poland. They are rarely of high quality, and meanwhile it is much more difficult for our European films to reach third country markets and viewers. In the meantime it is extremely important to support the spread of our culture. It is essential to promote European films in other countries. It is essential to ensure a better position for these films in third-country markets. In addition, strengthening the film industry will also ensure that the films produced are of higher quality. That will also be a significant value.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that an important factor here is the synergy effect achieved thanks to mobility and cooperation with third countries. Strengthening the protection of intellectual property is a significant matter raised by the programme, and also in connection with support for implementation of the UNESCO convention.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to say a huge thank-you to Mrs Hieronymi for her work on this programme and for the fact that she managed to finish before the end of this term of office. It was work that we did together, but her contribution was the greatest. I would like to thank very sincerely all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education with whom I worked during this term.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you to all those who have contributed to making our cultural diversity, not only in Europe, but also transcending borders. I would like, at the end of this speech, to give you some concrete examples of how this can work and how it has already worked.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have developed 11 training partnerships with Latin America, India, Canada, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia covering films, TV shows, animation, documentaries. For example, a cartoon connection between the EU and Latin America and Canada for training and developing a cartoon specialist. For instance Prime Exchange, a workshop for authors and producers from India and Europe, to understand better the financing and the marketing elements of films. And the promotion on the distribution has been done, for instance, by the European Producers Club, which organised co-producing workshops in China and in India.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dolma organised a documentary month in Chile, the Paris Project made co-produced productions between Japan and South Korea and Europe, and EuropaCinema has included a network of 230 European cinemas and 148 cinemas in the rest of the world, in order to exchange films between them. So here we can see very concrete action. It is not about big words but about deeds, in order to help the professionals to do themselves what they can best do: that is, to make films, to show films, to make films travel. Thanks to all those who have helped this to become a reality.</p>

I am certain that, with this impetus, the MEDIA Mundus programme, which has rightly been addressed today, will not only enjoy great success but will also be able to mobilise additional support in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically. It is an excellent example of how we can bring our cultural message to the world. That is why I would earnestly request that you convey this message to our governments with vigour. Promoting European culture collaboratively does not mean less national identity for all our countries and Member States in the European Union. Rather, it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our European culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world.</p>

  <section id="creitem7" title="7. Draft Commission Regulation on REACH, as regards Annex XVII (debate)">
    <intervention id="4-030" speaker_id="4308" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Ouzký and Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the draft Commission Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), as regards Annex XVII (O-0071/2009 – B6-0230/2009).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-031" speaker_id="4425" name="Guido Sacconi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos. Secondly, because we are debating one of the first measures to implement the extremely significant regulation that has, in a way, marked this parliamentary term, that is to say REACH.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today – let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf – we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue. I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 – the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed – this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos.</p>
      <p sl="it">The truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States – for the record, there are four of them – who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants. The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States’ compliance with all the Community rules on worker protection, effectively meaning that these plants, coming to the end of their lifecycle, do not generate problems for workers’ health.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a reason why we are not opposed to this: these exemptions do exist, but we must acknowledge that the Commission has provided a mechanism, so to speak, by which these exemptions will in time – in 2012, to be exact – be reviewed through reports to be made by the Member States concerned, on the basis of which the European Chemicals Agency will prepare a dossier providing for the gradual withdrawal of the exemptions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thus we are not opposed, but certainly with our resolution we want to give you in the Commission a strong impetus to be a bit bolder, to go a bit further and a bit faster, shall we say, above all bearing in mind that there are already alternatives to chrysotile asbestos, at least for high-voltage plants, and in fact the companies concerned have launched promising research programmes to find alternatives for low-voltage plants also.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are two aims to our stimulus and our input. The first is to set ourselves a date, a deadline – we are proposing 2015 – by which to lift these exemptions, launching a real withdrawal strategy, including measures that will then be required to demolish these plants in safety and also ensure safety as regards export.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, the second thing we are asking the Commission – and we would appreciate a reply on this, too – concerns a point that is critical for us, namely the fact that a Community list of articles containing asbestos for which an exemption applies has not yet been adopted, and so we are of course asking for this as soon as possible, by 2012, to enable better control and a better understanding.</p>

    <intervention id="4-033" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, first of all may I apologise on behalf of my colleagues, Vice-President Verheugen and Mr Dimas, who unfortunately cannot be here this morning to take part in this debate. I know that Mr Verheugen has had intensive and fruitful discussions with the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, whom I should like to thank for his excellent work – I say this on a personal level, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission fully subscribes to the objective of the human health and environment professions, on the one hand, by preventing all exposure to asbestos, and, on the other, by working on a total ban on the use of asbestos, in all its forms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the European Union there are very strict regulations on the placing on the market, use, export and disposal of asbestos fibres. The placing on the market and use of all asbestos fibres have already been banned outright by Directive 1999/77/EC.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as other uses are concerned, the Member States may permit the use of a form of chrysotile asbestos in electrolysis installations that were already in service in 1999 until they reach the end of their service life and suitable asbestos-free substitutes are provided.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Four Member States use this derogation. A review in 2006-2007 showed that all workplace exposure limits were respected and that there was no alternative available at the time for some very specific processes. This existing limit will be incorporated in Annex XVII to the REACH regulation, and the derogation for diaphragms containing chrysotile will be reviewed again in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In June 2011 the Member States will have to report on their efforts to develop chrysotile-free diaphragms, on the measures taken to protect workers, and on the sources and the quantities of chrysotile used. The Commission will then ask the European Chemicals Agency to examine the information sent with a view to abolishing this derogation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos provides for measures to control asbestos emissions during certain demolition, decontamination and disposal operations in order to ensure that those activities do not cause pollution by asbestos fibres or dust.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Directive 83/477/EEC, as amended by Directive 2003/18/EC, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, contains a series of measures to ensure adequate protection of the health of workers, where the latter are exposed to risks linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Companies must provide evidence of their ability to carry out demolition or asbestos removal work. Prior to the demolition or asbestos removal work, they must draw up a plan specifying the measures needed to ensure that workers are not exposed to an asbestos-in-air concentration of more than 0.1 asbestos fibres per cm3 during an average eight-hour shift.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Framework Directive 2006/12/EC on waste and Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, in concert with the Council decision on the criteria for waste acceptable in landfills, oblige the Member States to provide for the controlled disposal of asbestos fibres and equipment containing asbestos fibres. The Member States must ensure that the waste is recovered or destroyed without endangering human health and without requiring the use of processes or methods that could harm the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are detailed requirements concerning the process for the disposal and landfill of asbestos; for instance, the storage area must be re-covered each day and before each compaction operation. The landfill must be re-covered by a final layer in order to prevent the dispersion of fibres. Measures must be taken to prevent any possible use of the land after the closure of the landfill. Any potential exports of asbestos fibres are regulated under Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, and, since 2005, there has been only one notified case of asbestos fibres being exported from the European Union to a third country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the asbestos-related decisions appearing in Annex XVII of REACH are set to ban the manufacture of asbestos fibres within the European Union, which means that exports will be ruled out. Waste containing asbestos is hazardous waste. The Basel Convention and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste prohibit the export of asbestos waste to countries not belonging to the OECD. As regards shipments between Member States of the European Union and of the OECD, they are subject to a prior written notification and consent procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, and in the light of these points, I can assure you that the Commission will examine whether there are grounds to propose other legislative measures on the controlled disposal of asbestos fibres and on the decontamination or disposal of equipment containing asbestos fibres, which go beyond the legislation in force, both for the management of waste and for the protection of workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, as regards the list of articles containing asbestos, which may be authorised on the second-hand market, it is not yet available – to answer Mr Sacconi’s question immediately – but the Commission does plan to review the situation in 2011 in order to draw up a harmonised list valid throughout the European Union. I therefore hope I have met your request.</p>

    <intervention id="4-035" speaker_id="5735" name="Anne Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, in 1999 the European Union adopted a directive banning asbestos from 1 January 2005, but permitting a derogation for diaphragms used for existing electrolysis cells until they reached the end of their service life.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This derogation, which had to be re-examined before 1 January, was intended to enable the companies concerned to make plans to stop using asbestos. Here we are today, with an 18-month delay; it is therefore time that we made progress. It is true that, as part of the review of Annex XVII to REACH, the Commission is proposing to extend the current ban on the use and marketing of asbestos fibres and products containing these fibres, but it is maintaining the option for asbestos to be used in factory-based electrolysis installations, with no time limit imposed, even though asbestos-free alternatives do exist and are used by many companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another. This is unacceptable, since the use of this product is responsible for a large number of illnesses linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Furthermore, the number of people succumbing to these illnesses is likely to continue to rise over the next few years, as this product was still being used up until a few years ago. The effects of asbestos on health have long been known.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that the Commission’s decision undermines certain REACH provisions, not least the principle of substitution; it is a bad signal that has been sent out to the other companies. The current economic crisis cannot justify this extension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, this position of the Commission’s, which has the backing of a majority of Member States at the Council, is inconsistent with the European Union’s position, which aims to introduce a worldwide ban on asbestos.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one last point before I finish: the European Trade Union Confederation is today maintaining that it was not consulted on the matter and is suggesting that only the opinion of certain companies was heard and taken on board. The Commission, for its part, is claiming the opposite. Could you shed some light on this point for us?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-036" speaker_id="28321" name="Satu Hassi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the history of asbestos is a sad one and a cautionary tale of what can happen when the precautionary principle is ignored. Asbestos was first used as a material that had excellent technical properties, and then, later on, it was noticed that it killed people. For example, in my country, the number of deaths every year due to asbestos has still not gone down. After all, it can take anything up to 40 years for the disease to develop.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The purpose of the resolution before us is not to quash the comitology decision to which it refers. I think its most important points are paragraphs 8 and 9, which relate to the idea that the Commission should table a legislative proposal sometime this year concerning how asbestos, asbestos fibres, and equipment and structures containing them should be completely destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, we still have a large number of buildings, including public buildings, ships, factories and power stations, that have structures containing asbestos, and, for example, people are exposed to it when buildings are being renovated, if no strict protective measures are taken. These structures that contain asbestos need to be identified and demolished, and asbestos must be destroyed safely and in such a way that people will not be exposed to it again.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We should learn a lesson from the sad tale of asbestos and our experiences of it when we address new and present health risks. For example, researchers into nanocarbon tubes have said that their effects on health are very much the same as those of asbestos. For that reason, we need to learn a lesson from our experience and act in accordance with the precautionary principle, for example, when we adopt basic legislative instruments regarding nanomaterials.</p>

    <intervention id="4-037" speaker_id="28975" name="Vittorio Agnoletto" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, it really seems as though the thousands of deaths already caused by asbestos, and the tens of thousands of people at risk of dying in the coming years due to progressive exposure to asbestos – the latency period, we know, can be up to 15 or even 20 years – count for nothing at all.</p>
      <p sl="it">It seems as though the Eternit trial, which began in Turin concerning the events at Casale Monferrato, where there is not one family that has not suffered a loss, counts for nothing. Asbestos should have been banned operationally by the Member States applying the 1999 directive. The States should have taken every possible precaution to protect exposed workers, by applying the 2003 directive, closing factories, neutralising contaminated sites and compensating the victims and local people. This has not happened everywhere. Little or nothing has been done.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have already mentioned the trial in Turin, where Swiss and Belgian owners are accused. Everyone knew about it, but little was done, and above all the industry shirked its responsibilities, working within the loopholes created by the inertia of the public authorities. This inertia can be seen in the events in Italy, in Brioni, where asbestos has not been removed, in Porto Marghera and in Cengio, where deaths are still occurring. Today the industry is asking the Commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 REACH regulation, already granted for a limited period, for chrysotile asbestos fibres.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true, low-voltage electrolysis plants do represent a limited application, and there are only a few such plants, but where industrialists claim it is impossible to use any alternative then the plants should be closed. This may be blackmail, but alternatives to this process have been found in Sweden, using asbestos-free membrane technology as replacements, at low voltage, and a similar solution has also been adopted for the production of hydrogen. Why ‘yes’ in some States and ‘no’ in others? Because in the long battle to ban PCBs there have been countless omissions and stalling techniques, supported even by the European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry. In this case, too, a good example has not been set.</p>
      <p sl="it">The 1999 directive banning asbestos stipulated that the review of this authorisation should be preceded by an opinion from the scientific committee on toxicology, which was never produced. Is this how the Commission respects directives? Not to mention the trade unions, who say they were never even consulted.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others. This resolution calls on the Commission to bridge, by 2009, a legislative gap on the prohibition of second-hand products containing asbestos; roof pieces, aeroplane parts and whatever else should be disposed of once and for all. Yet again, precise dates are being set for a strategy to ban all types of asbestos by 2015, but these objectives were already set in 1999. Ten years have gone by and the deaths have continued.</p>
      <p sl="it">Among the first initiatives of this parliamentary term, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left called for the establishment of a Community fund to compensate victims and for ad hoc funds for decontamination. This was a specific request to the Commission, which today is instead bowing to the will of the multinationals. We need to move on, however, to practical action and commitments. Only when these are in place, starting with the demands of this resolution, can we be more understanding. Today that willingness is not evident, and so we will vote against granting this exemption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, you are very kind. Thank you for those words. It is good to be back for what is my last week in this Parliament – or any parliament. After 25 years of elected politics that is an adequate sufficiency, I think.</p>
      <p sl="de">I just want, on this last occasion, to say that many of us in this House have invested a lot of ourselves in the REACH process: Guido Sacconi and many colleagues have laid the foundations for a safer, better chemicals framework. My message to the next Parliament is, ‘Be vigilant; keep an eye on the process’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, as Satu Hassi has said, we have a long history on asbestos, and we have a very strong feeling that we need to watch out for that. When I was lying on my hospital bed, having my heart bypass and feeling sorry for myself, I was watching on the television the earthquake in Italy, and that put my problems into perspective. But it also, of course, reminded me in this context that, when you have a disaster like that, asbestos can be released into the atmosphere. Asbestos is very often safe while it is covered. As soon as it breaks out, that is when the dangers occur, and so one of the messages has to be that we need to look at the at-risk areas of our European Union to see where we should be highlighting the risk and monitoring it for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having said that, I would just say thank you to my colleagues for their friendship, their support and their messages in recent weeks. I shall treasure my 10 years in this Parliament, and I shall watch with interest as the next Parliament takes on the projects that perhaps we have been able to start.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to thank them for the work they have done, and for participating in the various alliances that have done credit to our Parliament. So, as a member of the European Parliament and today as Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission, I thank them for the extremely valuable contribution they have made to Parliament’s work, showing that there can be – despite what certain journalists have said at times – good representatives who attend and genuinely serve the institutions, which represent half a billion Europeans.

      <p sl="it">It needs to be refined because we have seen, in the brief time that discussion has been allowed on this, that there are different interests, all of which are absolutely legitimate, among the airlines, that there are companies waiting to replace others, where the first are unable to meet their commitments, that there are now distinct interests among airlines and airports, something that did not happen only a short time ago, and above all that there are the interests of passengers, most importantly those served by airports and airlines in the outermost regions, who would be at greater risk should the choice of retaining or abolishing slots depend solely on their profitability for the companies concerned.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are all issues that we have been able to touch on very quickly, but which we have laid on the table. Essentially, we also felt we had to deal with the basic problem, that of considering slots, as we ought to, as public goods that can be allocated or granted to private operators such as airlines and airports, but cannot be transferred as property.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a very sensitive topic and one that I believe we will have to revisit. I have to say that the reason, or worthy compromise, if you will, that lies behind our swift adoption of the proposal in the forms to be presented here is in fact in this, it is in being sure that the Commission will honour its commitment to return to this subject in a more thought-out, in-depth way, to tackle once and for all what is a crucial issue not only for overcoming the current crisis, but also for completing the process of restructuring and liberalising the global air market, and for building a better air market within Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why, combining current requirements with longer-term needs, I feel able to recommend that this report be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="it">I, too, in the 20 seconds I have left, Mr President, will take advantage of this last-day-of-school atmosphere to thank my classmates and those with whom I have had occasion to work over the last ten years, since I now have the great pleasure of ending my final day in Strasbourg with my last but by no means least contribution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, once again, as a former Member of this House, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and its chairman for their productive work when I was an MEP and for the cooperation they have shown me since I had the honour to be appointed, and endorsed by Parliament, as European Commissioner for Transport. This fruitful partnership, ladies and gentlemen, can be seen again today, and so I must thank Parliament once more, especially the transport committee, chaired by Mr Costa, for the speed with which they have handled the European Commission’s proposal on slots.</p>
      <p sl="it">A series of events – the economic crisis, the financial crisis, the new type A flu virus – is further aggravating the situation in the air transport industry, and this situation demonstrates just how urgent and indispensable support measures are, not only for the airlines, but also their employees.</p>
      <p sl="it">In light of this, I share Mr Costa’s concern. The Commission proposal is not a definitive solution. It is perhaps a proposal intended to address an emergency, but which will then need to be re-examined in detail in order to redesign the whole system; in fact on 15 April, in response to Mr Costa’s concerns and comments, I informed him, as the committee chairman, that the Commission Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is already preparing to present a proposal as soon as possible to revise the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The rule on the use of slots has already been suspended twice in the past in order to tackle crises. It is a global response to a global crisis, a response that clearly does not affect one or two Member States but affects the air transport system of the entire European Union and, in the most serious of circumstances – the attacks of 11 September and the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis – similar measures were taken. The crisis hitting the air transport industry today is probably more serious than those, and as yet we have no indication as to when we will start to see improvements.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reality is that traffic is in continual decline. Suspending the ‘use it or lose it’ rule for the summer season will benefit all companies, European or otherwise, without any discrimination, as the IATA and many non-European companies have pointed out, moreover. I am sure that this measure, which will be for a limited period and is an exception – the suspension will in fact be in force from 29 March to 26 October this year to then allow slots to be retained for the summer season of the following year – will give some breathing space to all companies, allowing them to address the drop in demand.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will also prevent paradoxical situations such as the current case where companies are forced to fly empty planes so as not to lose their slots, something I consider to be wholly unacceptable, not least from an environmental perspective, as well as detrimental for the airline’s finances – and we know than when a business is in difficulty, so are its employees.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that this measure is necessary and urgent, and so I cannot fail to support the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council, which will enable the proposal to be adopted immediately. For this reason I would again like to thank the chairman of the transport committee, and Parliament as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the one-off suspension of the 80% minimum usage rule for the take-off and landing rights at airports granted to airlines for the 2010 summer flight programme and thanks the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his speedy and effective handling of this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="de">The suspension now makes it possible for airlines to scrap flights in line with falling demand beyond the planned minimum usage without losing their take-off and landing rights for the next season. In my opinion, this is justified as a one-off, for one period, as the Vice-President said, because there has been an unforeseeable collapse in passenger numbers due to the international financial and economic crisis and because airlines cannot yet predict how passenger numbers will develop in the future. The suspension also helps to protect the environment, as airlines might otherwise feel obliged to fly half-empty aircraft just to keep their slots.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President, at the outset the PPE-DE Group rejected the regulation also proposed by you of empowering the Commission, without genuine codecision on the part of Parliament, to demand the suspension of the rule simply in the comitology procedure. We believe that, if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan, Parliament will have to examine it carefully, because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully. It is ‘yes’ to a one-off suspension but ‘no’ to the possibility of extension without the involvement of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">In all honesty, I believe that, with swine flu appearing not to be as virulent as first feared, airlines will ultimately have to be able to anticipate what possible passenger numbers and relations to expect over the coming years. We must expect airlines to submit realistic plans so that airports have the opportunity to offer unused slots to other airlines. It must be in our interests that airports be able to use their capacities in the best interests of their customers, the passengers. I have one other comment on the new, fundamental revision of the Slots Directive. I believe that the slots belong to the public and not to the airports or the airlines, and that is why we must pay particular attention to this in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate, this plenary session and my parliamentary activity draw to a close, allow me to extend my sincerest thanks to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism and in the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Vice-President of the Commission and his entire DG TREN team. We have spent the last five years working together in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. I will keep my fingers crossed for you that the next five years will bring more of the same. The Committee on Transport and Tourism is an important committee, and I thank you for your excellent cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank our chair, Paolo Costa, not only for producing this report but also for his work as chair of the committee over the past parliamentary period. We are very indebted to his hard work.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa’s work, because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon, allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations, is often needed when dealing with such technical details like ‘use it or lose it on the slot’. Our chair has been a very good Solomon and a very good United Nations diplomat during his time.</p>
      <p sl="en">But yet again the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue, with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low-cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension. What concerns me is that the big airlines, backed up by their various alliances, will not be satisfied with one suspension but will demand others and, knowing the unhealthy, undemocratic influence that some of them have both in this and national parliaments, I believe today is a mere start of a process, sadly not the end.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group will support the compromise proposed by our rapporteur and endorsed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but I stress that this suspension, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski often says of the ‘use it or lose it’ clause, is a one-off for one period and does not represent a green light for further suspensions. If the Commission feels that further suspensions are needed, then they must be made part of a revised regulation, fully involving this Parliament and fully respecting the rights of this Parliament. It is ‘yes’ to debate, it is ‘yes’ to cooperation, but it is ‘no’ to comitology.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recognise the perilous state that the aviation industry and airlines in particular face. I also understand that slots are not just about take-off and landings. They have become capital collateral on airlines’ financial books and our rapporteur is right when he states that this aspect needs to be revisited in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Suspension of ‘use it or lose it’ will not affect London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam Schiphol, but it will affect regional airports serving those hubs, because it is those routes the airlines will suspend. What airlines need to remember is that there are other stakeholders, not just them, that will be affected by this suspension.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because the economic situation is not good and because we recognise the nonsense of flying empty aircraft, we will support our rapporteur on this occasion, but I hope our caveats to this have been duly noted for future reference, not only in this Chamber, but by the wider aviation industry as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as the Socialist coordinator, can I thank all my team, but also my fellow coordinators from other groups for the sterling work and the cooperation that we have shared with each other during the last five years. I also extend those thanks to Commissioner Tajani and his team in the time that he has been in the Transport Commissioner’s seat.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time I have spoken in this House. It is, however, the first time because I am a new Member, and I have seen things that I do not like, that is to say Mr Costa has made a decision with his committee and then we find that there are deals going on. They may even be above board, but these deals done outside of the committee …</p>
      <p sl="it">They say there is democracy in Europe. I do not think so, Mr President. Democracy would mean transparency, and there has been little transparency here as regards Mr Costa, as regards citizens in the air sector, as regards people, as regards airports and as regards workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are supposedly talking about liberalisation, but in fact what we are dealing with is a monopoly. I say this because of departures from Linate airport and Malpensa airport that are monopolised by Alitalia-Air France. Take Linate, which is in dire straits with 160 000 positions in difficulty. Should we leave Linate congested to allow for the Frosinone airport advocated by Undersecretary Letta? I wonder then, are all these non-services provided because Alitalia does not have the aeroplanes to cover these services and these working hours? Why, then, do we not give them to other companies that can provide a service?</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Costa rightly said, ‘We are trying to do the best we can’. I am aware that there could well be people who do not like Mr Costa – I do – but someone must not, or they would not treat him with such disrespect.</p>
      <p sl="it">You see, Mr President, we are currently facing … Here, Linate has 126 000 on its waiting lists, while Alitalia-Air France does not want to make these journeys. Airports have to survive too, however. They have to cut flight costs. Why, since we are talking about the public right to flight slots, do we not start to teach Alitalia, Air France and many other airlines to work?</p>
      <p sl="it">So, in this regard, I not do not want there to be any electoral opportunism. You see, Mr President, these systems are known as ‘lobbies’ in Europe, whereas in Italy we call them ‘economic entities’, ‘the mafia’, ‘camorra’ and ‘ndrangheta’.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Tajani, Mr Costa, this is going to be my final contribution to a debate at the European Parliament, after a fifteen-year stint. For me, this is, therefore, a very special contribution and one that I am making in a special debate, a debate dealing with the six-month suspension of the regulation on what are known as ‘airport slots’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Over the past few years, I have sought to promote a green transport policy in order to secure the future of the transport sector. I think that, with this report, we have succeeded in doing that. Lowering the 80% threshold to 75% would not solve our problems. Even if we lowered it, the airlines would still not consider putting a stop to the practice of flying empty planes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fortunately, however, the compromise we have reached provides for solutions which are, first of all, good for the environment, but which also offer some support to the aviation sector, which has been hard-hit by the economic crisis. In this dossier, I think we have to conclude that there is something wrong with the current legislation relating to airport slots. As long as these slots remain so lucrative that it pays to fly empty planes, the present legislation is not going to make any difference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For this reason, I am pleased to see that the text indicates that any further suspension of the slot system will warrant a thoroughgoing change in the legislation. Of course, we would then need two different dossiers, so that any emergency action necessary could be taken rapidly and so that we could make sure there was enough time for a comprehensive review. I would be interested to hear Commissioner Tajani confirm whether this last supposition would be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would now like to round off both this speech and my work in this Parliament. It has always been a pleasure to work with my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to thank all my fellow Members for that and Chairman Costa, in particular, for his report, which we are currently discussing, and also for his readiness to work on a sensible compromise on airport slots.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to me it seems entirely appropriate that the exemption from current Community law should allow airlines to retain their slots.</p>
      <p sl="it">This exemption is proposed to tackle a crisis that is plain for all to see and which we have discussed many times. It should also be remembered that it is an exemption that can in some way, and I believe this is a positive thing, hinder the takeover by companies from third countries which, unlike Community carriers, are often able to benefit from State aid and other support, and I think this too should be considered.</p>
      <p sl="it">For the rest, my sympathies are wholly social, and my support for this initiative should be seen in that light. I am happy to say that those who, on the other hand, are confirmed liberalists, must this time take the complete opposite approach; who knows, they may mend their ways, which I would be very pleased to see.</p>
      <p sl="it">So, I take this opportunity – this will be my last speech this session and it is unlikely that I will be back here for the next parliamentary term – to thank everyone, those Members who without prejudice have allowed me to work with them and have thus undoubtedly given me an incomparable experience, both personally and politically.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wish you all well, and would especially like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Chairman Costa, Commissioner Tajani and all the Members of this House, and I would just like to conclude with an appeal for greater transparency, which I hope the next Parliament will truly offer, because we voted for transparency regarding the situation of the stagiaires, assistants and many of our co-workers, but it unfortunately has yet to materialise. Most of all, I would emphasise what we should offer in terms – I am finishing, Mr President – of transparency regarding the work we do here, since the press coverage, especially in the majority of the Italian press, is demagogical and totally absurd.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, everything of importance that needs to be said on this important text for air transport and for the people who depend on air transport, either as employees or passengers, has already been said. Just not by me. So I have deliberately chosen not to repeat what has already been said, but I would like to take this opportunity to say something about the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Tajani, you pointed out that this was not the first and, unfortunately, would probably not be the last crisis in the aviation industry that we, as well as the aviation industry, would have to deal with. It is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions. We have managed to do that. But we should not hide the fact that the crisis has also sometimes been used, is being used and will be used as a pretext to organise regulations that do not really serve the aviation industry or people but specific interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Denied Boarding Directive, with its relatively imprecise wording on the issue of ‘extraordinary circumstances’, we gave airlines the opportunity to interpret this notion very extensively. That is precisely what they are doing – at the expense of passengers. In this directive, we also neglected to impose fines for delays. In the last weeks and months in particular, airlines have exploited the fact they do not have to pay for delays but basically only have to grant minimum rights to passengers – again at the expense of passengers. We should not make the same mistake again.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore ask that, in the next parliamentary term, you, or those who will take over this dossier, submit a proposal to change this legal text.</p>
      <p sl="de">On another point, this is also my last day of school in this House, as it is for many fellow Members. On the first day of school you normally get a school bag. Perhaps on the last day there will also be a bag of sweets. Mr Tajani, I would like to request a ‘sweet’. Please do away with the nonsense we created at that time with the regulation on liquids and security checks at airports as quickly as possible. This regulation has been of benefit to no one and has protected no one. It has only caused anger. Just because no one is brave enough and resolute enough to tell people this and to carry out this abolition, we are all still suffering under this unspeakable regulation. Please fill this school bag and do away with this nonsense.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I listened to Mr Boso just now, and I am not underestimating the fact that there are special cases, particularly in Italy, where it would be preferable today to see slots opened up. However, I do believe that we need to keep a cool head and recognise that the crisis is affecting the aviation sector more quickly and more profoundly than ever before. It is without doubt one of the first sectors to be affected by budget cuts – corporate budgets, in terms of business travellers, and household budgets, in terms of summer holidaymakers. The other option would have been to open up slots completely, resulting in all likelihood in a scenario where the most powerful airlines would turn their empty aeroplanes round on the best slots, would abandon the least profitable spatial-planning slots, and where the low-cost airlines, which have a different economic model, would take advantage of it to sell off a few slots.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances. It would have had nothing to do with the real economy, with a functioning market; rather, it probably would have played a part in social dumping or in the defence of positions acquired, in the case of the most powerful airlines. That is why I believe that this moratorium is the least worst solution, provided that it is only temporary, that the events and the impact of this crisis are closely monitored, that developments are accounted for before Parliament, and that we open up the slots market while taking the time to effect a policy change and to consolidate a new European Union policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is my final speech before this House. It is a great privilege, after 10 years of working in the same committee, to take the floor at what is practically the end of the parliamentary term, in one of the very last debates, and to do so among one’s friends.

I should like to thank all of my colleagues, from all of the political groups. I do not think that I will enjoy another such rich, honest, sincere and profound political experience as this one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to say to Mr Tajani that I congratulate him on having accepted such a difficult mandate and portfolio as transport during this term of office, and that, because patience and length of time are what make a person competent here, he deserves to have this portfolio reassigned to him under the Commission’s next mandate.

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing something which is interesting because it shows the confrontation between the absolutely fundamental interest of airlines and the interest of consumers and passengers. At a time of crisis the airlines are saving themselves by asking for these limits, just as we have said here, to be extended into next year. If we help the airlines here, and I think that would be sensible, they must not do this at the cost of passengers. A situation in which the airlines really treat this matter as a pretext and cancel flights with impunity is a very dangerous situation.</p>

This is the last time that I shall be speaking from this particular seat in the Chamber: I shall be relocated during the changes. Can I just congratulate Mr Jarzembowski in particular on the work he has done on behalf of us all in the committee, and thank Mr Tajani, and also Mr Costa for bringing this matter before us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Debating the suspension of the 80/20 rule is very important, but it can only be a short-term measure and it must not be allowed to become part of the aviation policy in the longer term. The positives are obvious: helping carriers, especially the large national flag carriers, through the present economic downturn; also, not being able to fly empty planes to fulfil slot obligations is good for the environment. But the solution is not in this and it must not become permanent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current problems are linked to the present financial crash, but to claim the crisis in the aviation industry is wholly down to this would be wrong. The health of some of our flag carriers has been poor for a number of years, and they need to have a careful look at their own business models for the future. They must be viable business entities, not specially privileged organisations, and resorting to protectionist measures is not acceptable in general to me and to my colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will, of course, support the Commission in this. But I do not support the use of simplified procedure in the future and I think it would be a good idea for us to have a hearing on the Slot Allocation Directive, perhaps in the autumn or winter when we come back. We must find measures to put in place market-based incentives for airlines and airports. In times of difficulty, efficiency and innovation need to be rewarded – I am a fan of regional airports in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, let us just mention the plight of pilots: the suspension of ‘use it or lose it’ may well see some pilots out of a job. Speaking as a pilot myself: can the Commission please explain why the pilots’ associations were not consulted in this matter, and could it also confirm that the concerns of pilots and other people working in this industry will be fully taken into account?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has adopted, as a matter of urgency, a proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on the allocation of airport slots. The basic aim of this proposal is to suspend the 80/20 rule or, in other words, to prevent slots purchased previously from being auctioned off where they have not been used. This is not intended as a principle ad eternum nor as a right of ownership – as the committee chairman, Mr Costa, has just said – but as a temporary measure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This suspension is based on an awareness that the economic crisis has led to a widespread decline in passenger and freight air traffic, with a substantial impact on national carriers and other economic sectors, therefore making this a worrying time for jobs. As a result, we have a duty not to force airlines to operate flights at significant economic and environmental cost simply to retain their slots. That is why I support the suspension of this 80/20 rule.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Having said this, I must take this opportunity to question whether this approach will be sufficient to effectively respond to the global crisis affecting this sector or whether, as I believe, the Commission should consider and propose a programme of support for this sector, so that it is stable and in a position to grow after the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should remember that many airlines, as is the case with my country’s flag carrier, having previously overcome economic crises and having consolidated financially, now find themselves in a crisis situation that will be difficult to overcome, a crisis not of their making, but from which they are suffering.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my last speech in this legislative term and could be my last overall, depending on what the voters decide. I could not therefore let this opportunity pass without expressing my gratitude for the support and cooperation that I have always received from my fellow Members in my modest contribution to the construction of a European project and a response to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore want to express my thanks and gratitude, in this House, to you, Mr President, to Vice-President Tajani and to all my colleagues in my group. I must in particular mention those who have spoken here today – Mr Simpson and Mr Savary – and also those Members from other groups, such as the chairman of our committee, Mr Costa, with whom I have had the pleasure of working on several reports, and also Mr Jarzembowski, who I cannot miss out. He has led his group in this area of transport and has always been very cooperative, often rejecting my ideas, but telling me that he understood, and always with great elegance and a great sense of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the very least this is what I will take home with me, in order to work on what must be good democracy: the democracy of respect for pluralism and for the pursuit of our common goals.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The allocation of slots is an issue directly linked to the insufficient capacity available at airports, especially large ones. The economic crisis and the relative decrease in traffic caused by this only serve to put off, in the short term, dealing with the real problem, namely, the difficulties created by saturating large airport hubs and the potential saturation of small airports.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is our duty to find solutions to the problems which have occurred at the moment, but we must not lose sight of resolving the problems of the future either. Parliament has called on the European Commission to produce a coherent master plan for increasing airport capacity. A number of European airports have similar plans, but what is absolutely necessary is to coordinate them at European level as part of the single European sky initiative approved recently. I firmly believe that, as a result of setting up the European Observatory last November, this wish will come true in the near future. This plan is crucial for the sustainable development of the air transport sector, which is vital to the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The issue of slots is not only a European problem. Traffic at European airports does not only come from Europe. For this reason, a global solution needs to be found for the slots issue with the support of IATA, Eurocontrol and all the other agencies concerned in this area. This is why I believe that the recommendation made today to the Commission by Parliament to re-examine in the near future the impact of the crisis on air traffic and to review in this context Directive 95/93 is the most suitable method which we can propose at this time of uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Without carrying out a thorough analysis, we risk damaging in an unacceptable way both the principle of competition, which is fundamental to the economy, and emerging airlines whose development still depends, unfortunately, on the ‘use it or lose it’ rule. The losers in this situation would primarily be passengers, something which must not happen.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard here, air transport is affected by various critical situations, including SARS and Mexican flu. At the same time, there has been a fall in passenger numbers. I would like to mention one of the factors that may be playing a part in the decrease in passenger numbers, and that is the quality and capacity of airport services, especially security checks. I have to say that they are not only undignified – for instance, taking off your shoes and walking barefoot through the security check – but also, in terms of hygiene, a liability and a health hazard. I would not be surprised if passenger numbers had declined because of fears about infection – fears which the media are currently encouraging. So I would like the European Union to have better control over the hygiene of safety checks in airports, so that it can improve the well-being, safety and comfort of passengers. As this is the last time I shall take the floor before this House, I thank you all for your cooperation and wish you every success in the future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to say that the current situation is marked, above all, by the gap between steadily improving technological capabilities and security measures which are making life difficult for airport passengers and staff alike. I think it is in our interests, especially in the economic crisis now making itself felt throughout the world – and probably the autumn will bring another wave of this crisis, another attack of financial insecurity – that we should do everything we can to ensure that this sector overcomes its crisis and expands. It is my opinion that those who have resources and do not put them to use are destined to go into decline. I would like the European Union to avoid such a situation, and I would like us to be at the forefront of progress where the transport sector is concerned.</p>

    <intervention id="4-071" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to thank you and all those Members who took part in this debate regarding a temporary measure – and I would emphasise that temporary nature – in the field of air transport. Most importantly, I too would like to thank all those who are leaving Parliament for the work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to thank Mr Savary, who is no longer in the Chamber. I share his sentiment; I therefore hope to work with him again in the years to come, even if he is no longer an MEP.</p>
      <p sl="it">I sincerely thank those Members who are leaving the House for the help they have given the Commission, for their intelligent comments and also for the criticism they have offered. Parliament should fulfil this role, and no one is more convinced of this than I am, because I believe that, without Parliament’s strong input, the European institutions would be incomplete and unable to provide the best protection for citizens’ interests.</p>
      <p sl="it">For precisely that reason I would like to reassure Mr Jarzembowski, who asked me a question about the comitology procedure: the compromise, which has the Commission’s full support, provides for the use of codecision procedure as regards possible renewal for the winter season. This is purely hypothetical, because, I would emphasise, the measure is a temporary one and applies for six months only. Nonetheless, any future proposal for renewal must always be preceded by an impact assessment, taking account of the effects on consumers and on competition. It will also form part of a general review of the slots regulation, to which I have made a commitment before the Council, at the request of the UK transport minister, as I have confirmed many times in this House.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is, however, the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention. Indeed, data provided by the European Airport Association tells us that 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic, in January, between 8% and 10% as regards passengers, and between 25% and 30% as regards freight. This is therefore a difficult situation. I, too, share the hope and wish expressed by certain Members that the current influenza will turn out to be less serious than it was initially believed to be. We cannot hide the fact, though, that the proposal to suspend flights from the entire European Union to a country or to areas where the epidemic first broke out was on the agenda at last week’s meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, as well as the Council of Health Ministers. There could be repercussions, therefore, but no decision was taken since the situation was not deemed serious enough. However, it is clear that there is debate in this sector; some crews have decided not to fly to areas with known cases of influenza, which has caused a further drop in air passenger numbers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that as regards passenger rights – since it is a subject highlighted by many influential Members – the main thing is to maintain connections and frequency for the benefit precisely of citizens, and then to overcome the crisis. The financial soundness and sustainability of our airlines are key parameters to safeguarding the advantages of the internal market, and thanks to the internal market passengers have access to a variety of connections, routes and prices unprecedented in Europe. I want passengers to be able to continue to enjoy this possibility of choice. As regards the regulations on supervision, we must strengthen the monitoring and application of Regulation 261. To this end, the Commission will publish – let me address this to Mr Rack – a communication on the application of the regulation in the second half of 2009. On the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to liquids, as you know, we have already published the formerly secret annex behind this, and thanks to the use of new and more effective technologies from the point of view of security, we hope to be able to review the situation before 2010. I was highly sceptical of the liquids affair when I was an MEP, I remain so today and I am working precisely in order to reach that objective. As regards the concerns expressed by other Members over certain airports that could run into problems following this measure – I refer in particular to a European airport that forms part of one of the EU’s priority projects, the Malpensa airport – I can offer some information concerning airlines other than Alitalia-Air France. Let me read you some statistics: at Malpensa airport, a German airline, Lufthansa, had 8 741 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 19 520, an increase in capacity of more than 100%. Also at Malpensa, a low-cost airline, easyJet, had 15 534 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 22 936, a significant rise representing a 47% increase in capacity. It is also well known that the new airline Lufthansa Italia has plans, as we can read on the airline’s own website, thus in the public domain, to expand its network with new flights from Milan to Rome and to the cities of Naples and Bari as well as other European cities – Barcelona, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris. I can say then with absolute certainty that this measure will not cause any harm – and I say this as European Commissioner for Transport – to an airport and European hub like Malpensa, which is included in the Union’s priority projects.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament again for this debate, confirming what I said in my earlier speech, in reply to Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Simpson and Mr Blokland, as regards the commitment I am making today as Commissioner for Transport – and I hope to be able to do so again as future Commissioner for Transport – concerning the codecision procedure for matters relating to the issue of slots. Some of the ideas put forward, such as those included by the rapporteur in his initial amendments, deserve to be properly studied in the context of the future review of the regulation on the allocation of slots and – I repeat – the Commission staff, whom I thank again for the valuable contribution they have made in these weeks of difficult work, are willing to do this and are indeed in the process of drafting the new text. At the same time, as stipulated in the amendment we are debating today, the Commission will watch carefully to see how the air sector crisis develops and will propose measures to address this as necessary and appropriate, attaching great importance to safeguarding passenger rights. I will do this not only in the field of air transport but also in maritime, rail and bus and coach transport. This is a commitment we have made: there are legislative measures being discussed. I hope that the next parliamentary term can bring these to a conclusion, as our primary objective nonetheless remains to meet the needs of the people who elect this Parliament and who, through the consensus of this Parliament, rely on the European Commission, the Community executive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, may I also thank you, Mr Costa, and all those Members who have taken part in this debate, for their productive cooperation. The commitment I am making is to continue to work with Members of this House and with its Committee on Transport and Tourism to ensure that the democratic institution representing European citizens can play an increasingly influential role. I hope that with the Treaty of Lisbon the next Parliament will be able to make the voice of the European people heard more clearly.</p>

    <intervention id="4-074" speaker_id="4747" name="Paolo Costa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must simply stress three concepts. Firstly, on the issue in question, we came to a compromise, and a compromise must be respected. We know it is a compromise among institutions that keep their promises. It is a temporary measure and there will not be a second one: if there is a second measure it must be within the framework of an analysis and a more thorough proposal on slots.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just two suggestions, which I hope may be of some use: the first is to follow closely the effects of this suspension since, clearly, it will lead to a reduction of slots and mean that some slots and therefore some lines will not be used. The choice of what to do and what not to do will be in the hands of individual companies. In future, I think it would be better to consider that, if we have to reduce this activity again, then there should be public control of that choice, rather than leaving it purely to the profitability criteria of individual businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final suggestion is that, regardless of the existence or otherwise of the crisis, the subject of slots must be addressed properly, for its own sake. Restoring slots to the concept of public goods that can be authorised for use but cannot become the property of companies is a fundamental issue, although it must be handled with great care so that it does not instead become an instrument that threatens the viability of many of the airlines that we all depend on. Thank you all again for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is already the third time that, following a significant reduction in air traffic, the Union has had to use this automatic slot-renewal mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we have recently discovered, the rule on the obligation to fill 80% of slots, while necessary for the balance of the sector, is at times removed from the reality of the market.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women’s empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU’s external policies is still weak.

      <p sl="en">Furthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the Council. In fact, there is not a single female EU special representative at the moment. For this reason, the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field.

First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008. This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend. Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere. This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world.</p>

We are used to repeating that the European Parliament is the only European Union institution which is directly elected by the people. However, given that it is an institution elected by the people, in my opinion the European Parliament’s powers have until now been insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Therefore, I think that what we have adopted today, that is, Parliament’s new powers when applying the codecision procedure, new budget management powers, the new approval procedure, and new supervisory powers, is very important.

      <p sl="en">One by one, its most contentious articles and provisions are being brought in: the foreign minister and the foreign policy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the harmonisation of justice and home affairs. Then colleagues are going to turn around to the Irish electorate and say: ‘It is too late to vote “no” now, because we have implemented the whole thing, so all you would be doing is annoying everybody and isolating yourselves when, in fact, the bulk of the Lisbon Treaty is already in force de facto, if not de jure.’</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not know whether that is going to work. That is going to be up to the Irish electorate, but I would be rather disappointed if they gave in to pressure. It is, of course, for them to take their own decision, but these are, after all, people whose fathers saw off the might of the British Empire.

      <p sl="en">I think it is very important that we recognise, when it comes to the Lisbon Treaty, that it has not been ratified yet, and we should not behave as if it has been ratified. We should not ignore the will of the voters who have not yet ratified it and those countries that have not yet ratified it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us also remember the rules at the start of the game and let us not try to change the rules half-way through. At the start of the constitutional process the rules were that every country had to ratify or it fell. France and the Netherlands failed to ratify so the Constitution fell. Also with the Lisbon Treaty, the rules at the beginning were that every country has to ratify, otherwise it falls. Yet when the Irish people voted ‘no’ we decided to continue and to make them vote again.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is no easy response to this issue either. If there was, some country would have found it by now. In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin. That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support – including financial support – to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures. We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status. Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support. That is our challenge today.</p>

This has no mandate: nobody has voted for this creation of a European Asylum Office. But, of course, what we are doing is creating a new bureaucracy, which will now have a vested interest in the continuous harmonisation of policy at European level down the years, with or without any popular support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me finish my speech by quoting Churchill himself on the subject. He said: ‘We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed. And should European statesmen address us in the words that were used of old, “Shall I speak for thee to the King or the Captain of the Host?”, we should reply with the Shunamite woman “Nay, sir, for we dwell among our own people”.’</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise in support of the Costa report. However, I am concerned, and I wanted to bring to the attention of this House how provisions like these are being used to stifle competition rather than protect airlines, the purpose of this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not unusual for airlines to hoard airport slots. Let me share an example with you: Birmingham airport in my constituency. We have seen the suspension of direct flights to Amritsar by Air India. This highly popular and profitable service was cancelled last October, forcing customers into unnecessary travel and inconvenience to go to other airports, the reason being that Air India did not want to lose its highly valuable Heathrow slots. It really takes your breath away that there are plenty of other airlines who would be filling to fill the slots but are unable to because Air India is holding onto them.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I hope will happen as a result of this is that we will ensure that airlines do not hold on to slots unnecessarily. The Commission needs to be vigilant that this legislation is not misused.

      <p sl="ro">The resolution which we voted on today sends a powerful political signal to Chişinău, but this signal must be clearly backed up by specific actions from the Commission and the Council. I therefore call on the European Commission to actively cooperate with the democratic opposition in Chişinău to find effective ways of strengthening democratic awareness in the Republic of Moldova. The most effective way of doing this, in my view, is to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the Republic of Moldova within the Community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the issues that concerns a number of my constituents in London is the massive erosion of civil liberties that we have seen in Britain under the Labour Government since 1997. What concerns them even more is when I tell them about the massive erosion of civil liberties arising at the EU level. We have seen a number of treaties, such as the Prüm Treaty, that have caused great concern. Fortunately, a recent ruling by the ECJ forced the British Government to hand back the data and profiles of people who were proven innocent, when the Government wanted to keep hold of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the decision by the British Government to only remove the profiles of innocent people after at least six years shows that it has scant regard for our freedoms. The decision highlights that in Britain ‘innocent until proven guilty’ is treated as a dismissible sound bite, rather than as a fundamental precept of our society. It is bad enough that British police forces have access to this large amount of data and personal information, but other European governments will be able to access it too.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Prüm Treaty was forced into European law without proper democratic scrutiny. It was thought that over 3.5 million people could now have their personal information flung around the EU. This will fill few people with confidence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Some people argue that the numbers do not work. It will be giving up too much to give Gibraltar a seat. Well, for many years in this institution Denmark gave a seat to Greenland. Greenland has around twice the population of Gibraltar. Denmark gave 8% of its seats to 50 000 people. I am asking the British Government to give less than 1.5% of its seats to the 26 000 people in Gibraltar.</p>

      <p sl="en">The sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people. It is not there to guarantee the privileges of national parliamentarians. When we elect a parliament we entrust it with the safeguarding of our liberties for a temporary and contingent period. National parliamentarians have no right to make permanent derogations to those freedoms without going back and asking for an explicit mandate from the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have 646 Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. 638 of them were elected on the basis of an explicit promise that they would put the European Constitution to a referendum before they ratified it. When we hear all this stuff about how the European Constitution is now legal because all these parliamentarians have gone ahead with it, that does not invalidate the case for a referendum: it invalidates the case for representative democracy as it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you want to restore honour and meaning and purpose to our existing systems of representative government, we should trust the people and give them their referendum – as we promised. Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!</p>

It must be said that, despite international pressure, systematic intimidation, interrogation and sophisticated forms of violence have continued against the Women in White even in 2008. Several weeks ago the regime attempted in all manner of ways to prevent them from mounting a silent protest on the sixth anniversary of their husbands’ imprisonment. As a mark of support, a solidarity march for the Women in White and their husbands was held in Bratislava on 28 April 2009. Of the 75 activists imprisoned six years ago, whose cause has been backed by organisations including the EU, 54 remain behind bars. Only if we monitor their plight will we succeed in getting them out of prison before they are reduced to human wrecks. Let us not forget that we will soon be commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. What we can do for the Cuban prisoners and their wives now is to leave the paragraphs on human rights’ violations in Cuba in the text of the report.</p>

The fact is that Ms Saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month. There was no chance of a fair or transparent trial, because the trial was held in camera. She was on hunger strike for at least two weeks. It is true that she has ended this, but her health is in a very precarious state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we are here today to address a message to the Iranian authorities that we clearly condemn the sentence pronounced by the Iranian Revolutionary Court on 18 April 2009 and ask that Ms Saberi be immediately and unconditionally freed on the basis that the trial was held in camera, without legal process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add that Iran is notorious for its massive, systematic public executions, whether by stoning or by hanging, including of juvenile offenders. That, too, is part of our message.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Two and a half minutes, Madam President. Over the last five years, we have had many debates on Iran. My group had sympathy for the revolution at the end of the 1970s, not because of any affinity with the religious extremists of the time, but because the previous government, led by the Pahlevi family, did not represent the people. That government was only able to survive because of its close links to the United States and Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because the previous government to that, which had been led by Prime Minister Mossadeq and which had enjoyed more popular support, had been removed as a result of foreign pressure, the huge swathe of the population which was opposed to the government acquired an extreme anti-Western attitude. The West was not seen as an ally in the fight for democracy and progress, but as a colonial profiteer and oppressor.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nowadays, there is no longer any doubt that power has fallen into the hands of groups which not only seek conflict with the United States and Israel, but are also extremely conservative, intolerant and undemocratic. They oppress their own citizens, they have brought the judiciary and the army under the firm grip of religious fanatics and they are preventing the electorate from voting for people who hold more moderate views. The rights of women and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities have been shoved to one side and the death penalty is often carried out in public, in the cruellest of manners, as a means of suppressing non-conformist behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, opposition activities within Iran can result in detention. Members of the opposition who have fled abroad are being persecuted and discredited by the governments, media and public opinion of the countries where they now live. This can be seen from their attempts to place the opposition in exile on a list of terrorist organisations, as well as their attempts to close the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq. Quite rightly, this Parliament has recently spoken out against these two practices.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the first of May, which is a day of celebration for us in the West, unfortunately continues to be a day of struggle in Iran. This year it was marked not only by the usual brutal repression of demonstrations by Iranian workers, but also by the execution of a young woman aged 17, Delara Darabi, who was convicted of a crime, despite everything pointing to the fact that she did not commit this crime.</p>
      <p sl="pt">According to Amnesty International, on the day before her execution, this young woman had told her mother of her plans for the future, in the expectation that the huge campaign for her release would be successful.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Delara Darabi is yet another martyr of religious fanaticism, like so many others whose execution we have denounced in this House.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Human rights organisations have also this week confirmed the information, published on 1 May by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, about the stoning in Lakan prison of a man accused of adultery, and announced the imminent stoning of another man in the province of Gilan, once again belying the supposed Iranian moratorium on this barbaric practice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As reported by the movement which fights for the abolition of the death penalty, Tire as Mãos de Caim, Iran is the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world. Just this morning, four people were executed in Evin prison, with another eight having been executed in Taibad prison on 2 May.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The imprisonment of nationals of third countries, such as the American, Roxana Saberi, is also a routine practice in order to blackmail other countries into granting diplomatic concessions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this regard, the comment made by the Secretary of Tire as Mãos de Caim, Sergio D’Elia, is extremely pertinent and highlights the most important point: the brutality of the Mullahs’ regime is not only the responsibility of the Iranian fundamentalist regime. European governments are consenting to this through their silence, tolerance and constant desire to appease, and they are succumbing to the Iranian political and commercial blackmail. The Tehran regime is threatening the peace and security of the whole world and, even more clearly, of its own citizens, through acts which have been practised for decades. Instead of taking this into account, Europe is making Iran the solution to the problems of the Middle East, when it is actually the main problem.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On this final occasion that I will speak before the European Parliament, I call on those who will be here at the next sitting not to abandon the Iranians to their jailers and not to abandon the people of the Middle East to the abyss of religious fanaticism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will not repeat what was said already regarding the ruthless Iranian theocratic regime. I agree with those positions, but I want to approach the subject from an angle similar to that used by my fellow MEP, Mr Mayer, who has just left.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran, a country with thousands of years of civilisation and culture, is today in a sorry state of affairs as far as democracy, civil rights and justice are concerned. Some of our countries in the West are not free from blame for this situation. Let us not forget that governments such as those of the USA and Britain have for years supported, armed and kept in power the well-known monstrous dictatorship of the Shah of Iran. It was inevitable that, when the Shah was finally overthrown by popular uprising, Islamic extremists would find fertile ground to root themselves in power and cultivate feelings of hate towards the West.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then came the excessively aggressive behaviour of successive US administrations and the position of drastic sanctions, which only caused further suffering to ordinary Iranian people and further aggravated their hostile feelings towards the West. Hopefully the new President of the USA, Mr Obama, who has shown signs that he prefers to fight with his brain rather than with his fists, as the previous President, Mr Bush, so unsuccessfully did, will give new hope for the improvement of the likes of the Iranian people and the betterment of relations with the West.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such an approach will help ordinary Iranian citizens understand that the West wants to be their friend, not their enemy, and eventually the people of Iran will themselves overthrow the Islamic fundamentalist regime that so undemocratically controls their lives and causes them so much suffering, as in the case at the centre of our debate here today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Roxana Saberi is a 32-year-old journalist with dual American and Iranian citizenship, and is a graduate of several universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Iran. She was working as a journalist in Iran and continued to do so following the expiry of her accreditation, and was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison on a false charge of spying for the United States. In protest at the false charges and the lack of a fair trial she went on hunger strike. She is very emaciated. She began to drink sweetened water under medical care and has now ended her hunger strike, and is waiting for her appeal to be heard. Her health and her life are still in danger.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Iran is well known for its draconian punishments, and also for carrying out public executions, including on juveniles. We call for the release of Mrs Saberi.

      <p sl="lt">We are talking about Roxana Saberi, an American-Iranian journalist who worked for ABC Radio, the BBC and South African television. Accused of spying, sentenced to eight years and imprisoned, she went on hunger strike. On 1 May, very weak, she was transferred to the prison hospital. We know that for five weeks she was denied access to a lawyer. Her trial was neither fair nor transparent.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Yesterday the BBC announced that next week, on 12 May, the Appeal Court will hear Roxana Saberi’s appeal, but that this would again take place in a closed-door session. We condemn the Iranian Revolutionary Court’s unfounded decision on Roxana Saberi. In addition, I think it is very important to once again urge Iranian Government institutions to comply with the provisions of all international human rights instruments ratified by Iran, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which both guarantee the right to a fair trial.</p>

      <p sl="lt">On the last day of this legislative term, such a beautiful spring day, it would be nice to hope that somehow this subject, human rights violations, will one day no longer be on Parliament’s agenda, that we will no longer have to discuss it in this beautiful Chamber. However, sadly, this is just an illusion and today, as always, our agenda is overloaded and does not even contain all of the painful cases from various countries around the world.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This is not the first time we have discussed Iran in this plenary session. This time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of Roxana Saberi. She was first arrested for an apparently minor offence – purchasing wine – although in Iran it is an offence. Then, however, there was the charge that she was working as a journalist without official accreditation, which later turned into the charge that she was a US spy. The Iranian Government organised a one-day closed-door trial without witnesses or concrete, publicly declared charges.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This is not the first time the Iranian Government has trampled on human rights, imprisoned people unlawfully and passed verdicts which contravene international standards. The execution of Delara Darabi, the detention of the journalist Maryam Malek and defenders of workers’ rights – these are but a few examples. We must recognise that Iranian fundamentalists continue to organise political trials in an attempt to further intimidate free thinkers. It is regrettable that Iran is continuing its policy of self-isolation in this way and is failing to exploit initiatives by the international community and the new US Administration to normalise relations.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I have always said that dialogue and mutual understanding are better than confrontation, but this time I propose that we react in a very strict, hard manner to this case and that we demand that the Iranian regime’s court respect all international standards.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the jailing of the journalist Roxana Saberi on trumped-up spying charges is shameful and another appalling crime in the long list of criminal abuse by the fascist regime in Tehran.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last Friday, as Paulo Casaca told us, their executioners took a 23-year-old girl from her cell and led her to the gallows without first allowing her access to her parents. They hanged Dilara Darabi for a crime she denied committing at the age of 17.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what passes for justice in Iran. The medieval torture and execution of women – even pregnant women – and children is commonplace. The abuse of human rights is a daily fact of life, and yet we have people in this Parliament who support this corrupt and evil regime: just like those European companies which continue to do business with Iran, their eyes and ears are closed to the screams of the oppressed. Shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs. They should remember the lessons of history: every fascist regime is doomed to fail; freedom and justice will always prevail over evil.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, my original speaking time was unfairly cut short as it approached the two-and-a-half-minute limit, but the conclusion of my argument was that you cannot create change through foreign interventions or other forms of military violence. It was exactly that kind of approach in the past which led to the birth of the current regime. If you threaten Iran with foreign interventions, many people in Iran who hate the current government will actually rush to the government’s support in order to defend their fatherland.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, we must not go to the other extreme, either. It is wrong to seek cooperation with this regime in the belief that the current grouping will remain in power permanently or that supporting stability in this country will benefit the European energy supply. Consistently standing up for human rights and lending support to the democratic opposition are the only ways to bring about improvement. That will also include the kind of improvement which will benefit the victim who has been the subject of this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission is following closely the case of Ms Roxana Saberi, including the preparations for the appeal process that will begin early next week. The Commission is concerned about Ms Saberi’s health, weakened by a hunger strike that, according to Ms Saberi’s father, she started after she was sentenced to eight years in jail for alleged espionage by the Revolutionary Court of Tehran last month.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that Ms Saberi’s trial, held behind closed doors, did not meet the minimum standards required for a fair and transparent trial. The Commission fully supported the declaration issued by the Czech Presidency of the Council on Ms Saberi’s case on 22 April 2009. We hope that the Iranian judiciary will ensure a fair and transparent appeal trial without any delay, with all the guarantees provided by the Iranian legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is deeply concerned at the steady deterioration of the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran. The recent execution of Ms Delara Darabi, hanged on 1 May for a crime she allegedly committed when she was a minor, is another confirmation of this dismal situation. Also in this case the EU issued a statement strongly condemning the execution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has repeatedly urged, and will continue to do so, the Iranian authorities to respect their international commitments on human rights, including in relation to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, as can be seen from the resolution itself, after two months of violent clashes, Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of the capital of Madagascar, staged a coup d’état on 17 March of this year; he was supported by the army and a self-proclaimed ‘High Authority of Transition’, over which he presides, and he suspended the national assembly and the senate. Furthermore, pressure from rebels forced the democratically elected president to leave Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, last February Mr Rajoelina, who had been elected mayor of Antananarivo in December 2007, had, in turn, been forcibly removed from power by the previous government. I should add that the malaise felt by the population was exacerbated by the former government’s plan to rent one million hectares of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course, we also condemn the coup d’état and any attempt to seize power by undemocratic means. We also believe that the United Nations Security Council and international organisations of which Madagascar is a member do not recognise this de facto regime and we want constitutional order to be restored. We ask, too, that legal and constitutional systems be immediately re-established in the country and we call on all Malagasy parties to fully comply with the provisions of the constitution of Madagascar in order to overcome this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we also consider that democracy does not simply consist in holding elections and we should report major irregularities in the – a priori – legitimate government of Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, we are convinced that when constitutional order is restored it should be based on the objectives and principles that already appear in Recital K of this resolution, that is: a clear timetable for free, fair and transparent elections; the participation of all political groups and social stakeholders in the country, including the legitimate President Marc Ravalomanana and other key figures; thirdly, the promotion of a consensus between Malagasy parties; fourthly, respect for the constitution of Madagascar; and lastly, compliance with the relevant African Union instruments and Madagascar’s international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">What is clear is that we are once again facing a situation in which human rights are systematically breached. While the leading classes of Madagascar engage in a power struggle through coup d’états and fight over important, lucrative business contracts, 70% of the population is living on less than one dollar a day. That, and that alone, is what we need to resolve. Let us hope, then, that the European Union assumes its proper role in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, changing the subject completely and taking advantage of the fact that Commissioner Orban is present in the last session of this term, I would like to thank him personally for his management of his Directorate-General.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Bavaria and its municipalities have many contacts all over the world, as does the Catholic University of Eichstätt. I should therefore like to welcome a delegation of mayors from this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively. There are many cultural, economic and scientific contacts and a strong and supportive ecclesiastical presence. That is why it is all the more regrettable that, in this scenically beautiful and culturally rich country, such appalling abuses are being committed. There is a real danger that Madagascar, in its strategically important location, will become a failed state, like others we know of in Africa, first and foremost of which is Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important that orderly and democratic relations are restored there as quickly as possible. That is why I am pleased that we met the contact group a few days ago to discuss first concrete steps. We must create an appropriate structure to prepare for new elections under the leadership of the ousted democratically elected president, whom we continue to recognise as the only legitimate head of state.</p>
      <p sl="de">A dialogue must be opened, which must include the prime minister, who is currently in prison and who must be released immediately. Not only humanitarian aid but also vital development aid, especially medical care, must continue to be given to the fullest extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">For all these reasons, we in the European Union are called upon to be involved in the negotiations there, not only as a humanitarian factor and not only as an economic factor, but especially as a political factor bringing about peace in the region. To achieve this, we count on the cooperation of the African Union, which once again has the opportunity to establish itself little by little as a factor in democratic stabilisation – stabilisation can in fact also be anti-democratic – which we will intensively support with the means at our disposal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, in Madagascar, the incumbent president was forced to step down by popular protest. He came to agreements with foreign companies that brought short-term revenue to his government but were detrimental to his people. That made his position untenable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Afterwards, with the help of the army, the leader of the opposition, who had previously been the capital’s mayor, was appointed interim president, despite the fact that, by law, he was too young to be appointed to that office. This process, in particular the intervention of the army, has led to criticism. The African Union has called this an illegal coup and rejects the new government.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I think that we could also draw a comparison between this and recent events in one particular European country, Iceland. In that country, too, the government had to step down in the face of popular protest. A minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power, but nobody considered that a coup. Since then, a new election has been held and the new government has secured a large majority. Such an outcome is also possible in Madagascar, provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group and as the Party of European Socialists’ shadow rapporteur on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the group of southern African countries that included Madagascar. In April we overwhelmingly approved that Economic Partnership Agreement with reservations about the situation in Zimbabwe. If we were debating that EPA today, we would have to enter our reservations regarding Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet only 15 years ago there seems to have been the potential for Madagascar to be so different. I can remember in 1993 the visit of the then newly elected President Albert Zafy. But, of course, by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power. Since then, Madagascar has been troubled by unstable governments with threats of secession and impeachment punctuating a rough politics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we have a situation – an army coup d’état – partly triggered by a plan by the former government to lease one million acres of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm for intensive farming, when a substantial majority of the population live on less than one euro a day. This unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the fact that the UN has appealed for nearly USD 36 million worth of humanitarian aid, anticipating the food shortages that will result later this year from the current political events in Madagascar, but we strongly condemn the coup d’état and all attempts to seize power by undemocratic means. We call for the immediate restoration of the legal and constitutional order in the country and ask all Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the constitution. We want to see the suspension of the National Assembly and Senate lifted and urge that the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians be respected.</p>

The African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the International Organisation of French-Speaking Countries, the Interparliamentary Union, the European Union, speaking via the Commission, the United States, and a large number of countries, including my own and Norway – to speak of countries from the European continent – have condemned the coup d’état – for that is what it is – which has taken place in Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot keep silent and we are calling for a return to constitutional order. We are simply asking for a ‘back-to-basics’ approach with, where necessary, arbitration by the Malagasy people through consultation in the form of a presidential election or a referendum. It is the responsibility of the assemblies and the politicians of Madagascar to decide on the most effective form of consultation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, what we are calling for with this joint motion for a resolution is to add our voice to that of the international community in order to make it clear to those who have seized power in a totally undemocratic fashion, in the form of a coup d’état – as disguised as it may be – that Madagascar’s constitutional order must be restored, as one of the guarantees of the future development of this large island in the Indian Ocean.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the political crisis in Madagascar has led to an unconstitutional change of government. This was accompanied by unrest, in which over 130 people lost their lives.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madagascar was under French rule until 1960. It is a country in a difficult situation. It is in need of humanitarian aid, and especially food aid, and this help has been given to Madagascar. The authorities and successive elections which they organised were supported by the army. President Ravalomanana lost support, and he stood down on 17 March 2009. Power was seized by Rajoelina, who was designated by the army.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union does not recognise the new government because of the undemocratic way in which this change was made.

      <p sl="pl">We call for restoration of constitutional order in Madagascar. We appeal to the international community to support efforts to restore the legal basis of the function of this state.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in the first weeks of March we were witnesses of a dramatic coup d’état in Madagascar. The rivalry, which has existed for several years, between the deposed president and the leader of the opposition led the island to the brink of civil war. On 17 March 2009, the day following capture of the Presidential Palace by the army, Andry Rajoelina declared himself head of state. The Malagasy Supreme Court stated that the former Mayor of Antananarivo holds this office in accordance with the Constitution. Doubts have been raised about this, if only because there is a clause in the organic statute which says that to be president a person must be at least 40 years of age, and the new president is only 34.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The assumption of power and the decision of the Supreme Court have aroused universal controversy. The swearing-in ceremony was boycotted by most foreign diplomats, and the African Union has suspended Madagascar from membership. The political crisis has led to general chaos and destabilisation in the country, where most people have lived for years in terrible poverty on USD 1 a day, and have limited access to food and water, basic medical services and education. I lived in Madagascar for six years, and I became thoroughly acquainted with these problems, and therefore I very strongly support the UN appeal for urgent humanitarian aid for the people of Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament should strongly condemn the coup d’état and all attempts at taking power which break democratic principles. The European Union should call for a renewal of the work of both houses of parliament, which have been suspended by the new regime. We should also support the efforts of the special envoy of the African Union and representatives of the UN in their talks with representatives of local political parties and all interested groups in order to bring about an immediate restoration of constitutional order in the country, and the international community should decidedly increase its efforts at bringing humanitarian aid to the people of the island, who are living on the brink of poverty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Madagascar, which is a former French colony, seems to be undergoing the sad – but not unusual – post-colonial turmoil in its political life, with the consequent suffering for its people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many other colonies of European countries have suffered – or are still suffering – for the same reason. There are many examples. My own country, Cyprus, is one. Having partly gained independence from its colonial master, Britain, in 1960, British foreign diplomacy hawks managed in 1963 to manipulate an inter-community struggle which eventually resulted in the division of the island in 1974.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a division that persists today and a state of affairs which suits Britain. A divided Cyprus cannot successfully attempt to get rid of the remaining two British colonial areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which Britain uses for military purposes, and which the British Government has in fact managed to disgracefully keep outside the EU so that the acquis cannot be applied to the thousands of Cypriot civilians – now EU citizens – who live there.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly I would like to underline the Commission’s great concern at the current volatile situation in Madagascar. I would also like to stress the Commission’s continued commitment to the Malagasy people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in that country after the forced removal of President Ravalomanana on 17 March deserves and requires our full attention and, like the European Parliament, the Commission is following events very closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has fully endorsed the Czech Presidency statement issued on behalf of the European Union on 20 March condemning the transfer of power and calling on the Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the Constitution of Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that there has been a flagrant violation of essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and that this is a ‘case of special urgency’ within the meaning of Article 96 of that Agreement. The Commission has therefore launched the procedure to propose to the Council to open consultation with the authorities in power in order to examine possible solutions to the crisis, aimed at the re-establishment of constitutional order.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to use all the dialogue means it has at its disposal to find an overall solution to the current crisis. To that end, it is enhancing the political dialogue, based on Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, with all the relevant stakeholders in Madagascar.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also participating in the main international efforts deployed, notably in the framework of the international contact group set up recently by the African Union. At this stage, the prevailing view is that the relevant Malagasy political stakeholders agree on a road map for a return to constitutional order and the holding of elections.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on three motions for resolutions on Venezuela.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-278" speaker_id="4319" name="Pilar Ayuso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, I have signed this resolution and asked to speak in this plenary because I was a witness to the so-called ‘expulsion’ of our colleague Luis Herrero, which was, in fact, a kidnapping. What is more, I had a chance to see how political persecution, abuses of power by the Chávez regime, intimidation of the opposition, threats, disregard for human dignity and the misuse of justice are all a normal part of life in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">The case of Manuel Rosales was the last straw and the catalyst for this resolution, but there are thousands of cases just as bloody as his; some of them are quoted in the resolution and others are not, like the case of Eligio Cedeño who was born in the poor Caracas suburb of Petare, a notoriously dangerous area well known for electing a mayor who was not from the Chávez regime. Eligio was educated with the help of others, in particular, from Citibank; he managed to set up his own business, the Bank of Caracas, and then lived a normal life, also providing help to the most needy. Today, however, he is illegally imprisoned in a Caracas jail following two years of detention with no coherent case being made against him. His only crime was to be a part of the economic oligarchy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another case is that of Nixon Moreno, a student leader at the University of the Andes, elected to the university council several times and president of the Federation of University Centres. In 2003 he won the Federation election against the current Minister of Interior and Justice, and that is his crime. Today he is accused of attempted murder and lewd violent acts, despite having been exonerated of the accusations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Cases such as these are a feature of everyday life in Venezuela, where persecution of the opposition with the aim of excluding them from political life and of suppressing dissidents has become part of normal life. Nevertheless, we need to send a message of hope to Venezuelan democracy: despite the challenges, I am sure democracy will be established and President Chávez will be voted out.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the case of Manuel Rosales is another example of the arrogance and paranoid behaviour sometimes exhibited by the increasingly more authoritarian Government of Venezuela. The political persecution of Mr Rosales and many others is regrettable and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We will call on the Government of that country in earnest to start behaving sensibly and democratically and to stop violating the human rights of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, since this is the last time I will be making a speech in the plenary, permit me to take the opportunity to thank you and all our colleagues who have faithfully attended the Thursday afternoon human rights debates and have contributed towards making our world a better place to live in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also take the opportunity, as I have so often done in the past, to remind my colleagues of the plight of my own country, Cyprus, which for the past 35 years has been suffering under the military occupation of its northern part by Turkey. The citizens – EU citizens – of areas such as Kyrenia, Famagusta, Karpasia and Morfou have been living in exile since the devastating Turkish invasion of 1974. We are looking towards the EU for the fulfilment of their humble wish to return to their homes and live there in peace and security. I hope the EU will not let them down.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, when political changes point to restrictions on the rights of the opposition to free public expression, we should be on our guard. It is a strong signal that democracy is under threat. Arresting the opposition is an even stronger signal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is what is happening today in Venezuela. Manuel Rosales, Mayor of Maracaibo and opponent of President Chávez in the 2006 election, has had to flee the country. Shortly after President Chávez won a referendum making it possible for him to hold office for further terms, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr Rosales. He managed to escape to Peru, where he is in hiding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This matter should be the subject of the next sitting of EuroLat. Venezuela is obliged to respect conventions which it has signed in which it guaranteed to respect human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan-European picnic on the Austro-Hungarian border. I had the honour of being allowed to take part in the relevant preparations and I will never forget, a short time later, the Chancellor of Unity, Helmut Kohl, and Pope John Paul II, two spearheads of this development, striding through the Brandenburg Gates and saying that socialism should not be replaced by predatory capitalism but by freedom and a social market economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, we are witnessing in Latin America a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression. The germ from which this comes is, I am afraid to say, Venezuela. President Chávez is attempting to stifle freedom throughout Latin America by means of oil money. That is why the case of Manuel Rosales is so important. Mr Rosales is not only an outstanding democrat, whom we must defend; he is also a symbolic figure for democracy in Latin America. We shall support him and continue to stand up for the freedom of the Latin American people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">By means of yet another grotesque exercise in the distortion of reality, we are once again faced with an ignoble attempt by the European Parliament to interfere in Venezuela. In essence, this attempt forms part of the manoeuvres conducted by those conspiring against the democratic and sovereign process of emancipation and social progress initiated a decade ago by the Venezuelan people and reaffirmed in 14 electoral processes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Once again, what is really bothering the authors of this initiative is the fact that, despite all the problems, threats, dangers and interference, the Venezuelan people have been an example of the fact that it is worth fighting and that it is possible to build a fairer, more democratic and more peaceful country, and world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is being demonstrated by the development of widespread popular participation, the reduction in levels of poverty, social inequality and unemployment, the fight against illiteracy and the extension of education to all levels, access by millions of Venezuelans to health, the national network of food markets at subsidised prices, the de facto nationalisation of the state oil industry and strategic sectors of the economy, the use of productive land by farmers, and solidarity with other peoples, among many other examples.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have to ask ourselves: in the end what right does this Parliament have to give lessons in democracy and respect for human rights, when it wants to impose a draft Treaty rejected by the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, when it adopts the inhumane Return Directive which violates the human rights of migrants, many of whom come from Latin America, and when it does not have a single word of condemnation for the barbaric aggression of Israel against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I used to live in Venezuela myself and I am familiar with that country’s past and, in particular, the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in the 1950s. Poverty and injustice were the hallmarks of life at the time, and I consider Hugo Chávez’s government to be a very significant and much-needed improvement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, I am of the view that even a sympathetic government should behave decently towards its opponents and avoid employing any techniques which make life extra-difficult for its opponents.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will be voting in favour of the joint resolution for exactly that reason because it is critical with regard to protecting democracy in general and because it was not formulated with the aim of overturning what in my opinion is the beneficial regime of Hugo Chávez.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to correct Mr Guerreiro who is misinformed because, according to figures from the United Nations Development Programme, in the last 10 years Venezuela has not reduced poverty one iota.</p>
      <p sl="pt">President Chávez has brought demagogy and dictatorship, unfortunately with support through the ballot boxes, but also with a great deal of intimidation of the people, as once again shown by this case of Manuel Rosales.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I have met Manuel Rosales. I had the honour of meeting him on a visit to Venezuela. The fate that has befallen him is a great shame, because he wants to be a free man in his own country, but he cannot be a free man in his own country. That is the problem with Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I met him when he was governor-elect of the State of Zulia. He was elected by his people as Mayor of Maracaibo, but cannot live in his own country because, in Venezuela, people are persecuted and slandered. They are slandered, as is unfortunately happening with Manuel Rosales. It is the worst punishment that can be inflicted on a politician and we, who are politicians in this House, must all be aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We can fight for our ideas, but we do not have the right to slander anyone, persecute them or throw them into jail. This is exactly what is happening in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is time, ladies and gentlemen, that we defined a strategy for Latin America. This must be a strategy of active diplomacy for Latin America. It must certainly be on the side of social progress, in line with the many millions that we invest every year in development and cooperation, but it must be 100% on the side of democracy, 100% on the side of pluralism, and 100% on the side of fundamental freedoms. Long live a free Venezuela!</p>

      <p sl="sk">Poverty always provides fertile soil for totalitarian leaders wishing to pose as the saviours and defenders of their people. In reality they do this only for their own benefit. At first, Hugo Chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world. With the passage of time, however, he did start talking about socialism. His opponents were not invited to cooperate and they became his mortal enemies and later on political prisoners. He then interfered with media freedoms and those who would not toe the line were shut down. One-sided information, the leader-defender, violations of human rights, lack of freedom: this all adds up to totalitarianism. The case of Manuel Rosales only confirms what I am saying.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Other leaders playing the same game as Hugo Chávez include Castro’s heirs, Lukashenko and the like. I would like to thank all my fellow Members of the European Parliament for sending a clear signal to the whole world via these Thursday afternoons during the plenary session that the European Parliament will never tolerate human rights violations anywhere in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the current term of the European Parliament is drawing to a close, and so the time has come for a certain summing up. We can say objectively that we have done a huge amount of work, and that among the results of our work we can clearly see a commitment to protecting human rights and the effects of this. This is especially visible in third countries. We are capable of making a very thorough analysis, as we are doing today, of the situation in Iran, Madagascar and Venezuela. We can adopt suitable resolutions and even give them public effect. These resolutions do not always bring the desired results, but we are working at a long distance from the countries and societies which have these problems, and our communication and ability to implement and convey our ideas is not always particularly good.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worse, ladies and gentlemen, with democracy and the protection of human rights within the European Union. This is an unpleasant and embarrassing matter. Today millions of people are working illegally. So what has happened to human rights? The trafficking of children and women is flourishing. So where are human rights in the EU? How are we protecting them? Why are we not effective?</p>
      <p sl="pl">It must also be said that an unpleasant incident occurred when here in this Chamber we demonstrated for a referendum, and Mr Pöttering called in security, which was a breach of human rights and our right to demonstrate and express our views. Nevertheless, the overall result is positive, and I think that we should definitely continue this kind of debate, and this kind of action, in the next parliamentary term.</p>

      <p sl="en">The leader of my party, Mr David Cameron, has made a serious mistake. He is in error: he thinks that by becoming anti-European in the House of Commons this will secure him the premiership of my country. I, as a British Conservative, reserve the right to object – that is my final word. There are British Tories, Socialists, Liberals. We are Europeans. We will stand with our partners and our allies and, if my party leader seeks to rip up 30 years of work by British Tory pro-Europeans, he is wrong!</p>

He was granted political asylum in Peru after being charged with corruption in Venezuela. The Commission has taken note of the explanation provided by the president of Rosales’ party, according to which he has gone into hiding for his own protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes that the request for asylum made by Manuel Rosales, and its acceptance by the Peruvian Government, is a bilateral case and that it is not for the Commission to pronounce itself on the merits of this request.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in Venezuela. We know that some sectors of Venezuelan society have criticised the proliferation of measures which they consider adversely affect the right to freedom of expression and the freedom to exercise political rights. This same sector considers that the Government is showing an intolerant attitude towards criticism. We are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline the importance that the European Union attaches to freedom of expression and opinion, a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law. We hope that the democratic institutions of Venezuela will respect the rule of law and preserve democracy in the country, whilst complying with the obligation arising from the international agreements signed and ratified by Venezuela, including the American Convention on Human Rights and, specifically, the provisions on political rights set out in Article 23.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to follow developments in Venezuela closely.
