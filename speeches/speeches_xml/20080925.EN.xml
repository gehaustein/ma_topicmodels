      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Mr Bowis, co-rapporteurs, draftsmen of the opinion, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the European Parliament for agreeing to defer our working meeting originally scheduled for the beginning of this month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the French Presidency attaches great importance to consultation and dialogue on legislation. I felt it was essential to hold an initial exchange of views with my ministerial colleagues at the informal Angers Council on 8 and 9 September before coming before you to set out not, of course, the French position, but the position of the Council of 27 health ministers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That first exchange of views, like the initial work done in the Council’s working group on health, will not enable me to answer all your questions on this highly complex and varied subject but I am certain our sitting today will give the Commissioner responsible for health a chance to explain the European Commission’s major decisions and allow me to share the Council’s first impressions with you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council supports the adoption of a directive on cross-border healthcare and patients’ rights. It would be inconceivable to leave the decisions in this area solely in the hands of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. In my view, which I share with my colleagues, that should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or even of the content of its judgments, which often bring about major advances for patients. Nonetheless, it would be advisable for health policy in Europe to be developed by the two co-legislators, i.e. you and us, as the outcome of a political dialogue and a democratic process. It must be our common objective to build up a legislative framework that can contribute toward legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second point: in Angers, the delegations from the 27 countries all praised the quality of the work done over these past months and agreed that they had been listened to during the recent consultations. Commissioner Vassiliou was warmly thanked for that at the informal Council meeting. Indeed, the Slovenian Presidency will no doubt have informed you that the Council was very hesitant about the initial version of the text, the broad lines of which had been presented to the EPSCO Council of 19 December 2007. Only a small minority of states had supported that version. In fact, there was similarly great opposition to it in your Parliament, as MEPs confirmed to me during my preparatory consultations with the French Presidency in Strasbourg, Brussels and Paris. There is no doubt that the political dialogue Commissioner Vassiliou started as soon as she took office helped establish a sound basis for negotiation and the Council welcomes that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Third point: with regard to the timetable, this proposal that the college of Commissioners adopted on 2 July came too late for us to be able to envisage a first reading during our Presidency, but we will press on with negotiations in the Council as far as we can, while entering into a political dialogue with the European Parliament. In that vein, the public health working group has already considered the directive on several occasions. It will be meeting again tomorrow to continue examining the text article by article. In this area as with our other political priorities, France will play its part in the presidential trio by working closely with the Czech Republic and Sweden. For the record, let me remind you that the subject of European health in the service of the patients has been a priority of our common 18-month programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourth point: regarding the scope of the draft directive, I know from talking to MEPs on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection when they were in Paris last May that many of you regret the decision to confine this text solely to patient mobility and not to address the question of the mobility of health professionals. Given that I myself was an MEP at the time of the vote on the report by Evelyne Gebhardt and left Parliament just a few days before the debate on Bernadette Vergnaud’s report, I well understand the reasons for that regret. Excluding health services from the directive on services in the internal market leaves a grey area that is not entirely covered by the current proposal for a directive, which only addresses patient mobility. One could even say that the proposal for a directive has more to do with the wish to incorporate and adapt Court of Justice case law than with excluding health services from the services directive and therefore with the demands by some MEPs for a specific sectoral instrument covering health services. There was no debate on that subject by the health ministers. Yet, in that regard, it is all a question of timetables and the European Commission’s decision can be explained by the need to respond as rapidly as possible to the challenges that exist in the area of patient mobility, which already covers a very wide field. It is certain that a more broadly-based directive that included the mobility of health professionals would have had no chance of being adopted before the elections next June.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fifth point: regarding the content of the text, we have not yet addressed all the proposed provisions. Nevertheless, the Presidency can say at this stage that in the Council’s view prior authorisation for hospital care is a key question for EU Member States. It could even be described as the fundamental concern of health ministers. During the working lunch on the subject organised in Angers on 9 September, ministers who spoke were in favour of moving towards a better balance between the individual rights of patients to mobility and maintaining national regulatory and planning powers for the benefit of all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text reflects that improved balance, in particular by restoring the need for prior authorisation for hospital care. It is not a question of calling into question the case law of the Court of Justice, which specified how the principles of free movement set out in the Treaty applied to the health field, but of the need to incorporate in positive legislation the balance that the Court has already established in its case law between the principle of free movement and Member States’ regulatory capacity. In fact, it distinguished between outpatient care, where the affiliation system cannot require prior authorisation, and hospital treatment, where the requirement of prior authorisation appears to be a necessary and reasonable measure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time of serious budgetary constraints – ageing, technical progress – Member States must be able to be fully in charge of the care they provide in this respect, in particular hospital planning. As the Court itself recognised, one purpose of that planning is to ensure adequate and permanent access to a balanced range of quality hospital treatment throughout a national territory. It also forms part of the effort to control costs and to avoid, where possible, any waste of human, financial or technical resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also want to point out that the requirement of prior authorisation ensures that cross-border care can be provided as soon as it is medically justified. In fact, the regulation on the coordination of social security systems already recognises this: authorisation may not be refused in the event that the same treatment is not available within a reasonable time. Nor must we forget that prior authorisation is also a protective measure for patients, since it ensures that any care provided in another Member State will be reimbursed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, even if we keep to what we regard as the correct interpretation of the Court’s case law, the directive would still offer great added value by clarifying the rights of patients, providing them with the necessary information and ensuring that this case law is interpreted in a uniform manner and is therefore applied universally and consistently in all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you for your attention. I will be taking the floor again at the end of the debate to answer your questions.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androula Vassiliou" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have already had the opportunity to discuss this proposal at length with various stakeholders and players in the decision-making process. You may recall that I presented the proposal to the Committee on the Environment and Public Health upon its adoption by the college and had a fruitful exchange of views. And I have also had the chance to exchange views with various national parliaments and, of course, the Member States in the context of the recent informal Health Council in Angers. It now gives me great pleasure to have this discussion, and I am looking forward to it with you, the honourable Members, in plenary. I take this opportunity to thank Mrs Bachelot-Narquin for the support and the chance she gave me to discuss this issue at length with the ministers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to put the proposal on patients’ rights into context. Following the numerous discussions of the European Court of Justice on the question of the inherent right of European citizens under the Treaty to seek health care in the Member State of their choice and following the specific request by the European Council and the European Parliament alike to present a proposal to regulate the right after the health-care-related provisions had been taken out – and quite rightly so – of the Services Directive proposal, the Commission adopted the proposal on patients’ rights in cross-border health care on 2 July.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is without doubt the most important initiative on health of this present Commission. Its aim is to provide patients with better opportunities and access to health care, regardless of their place of residence while fully respecting national responsibilities over health-care organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has three main objectives: first, to clarify the conditions under which patients will be entitled to seek cross-border health care and be reimbursed and to make it effective, if this is the best solution for their particular situation; second, to ensure high-quality and safe cross-border health care throughout Europe; and, third, to foster European cooperation between health-care systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is based, as I said, on the Court of Justice jurisprudence. It is fully in line with the Treaty, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, with the competences of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal is structured around three main areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, it clarifies and reaffirms the common principles of all EU health systems: universality, equity, access to good-quality health care, and solidarity. It recalls the overarching principle underlined by the Treaty and the Court that the Member State on whose territory the health care is provided is fully responsible for setting the rules and ensuring compliance with these common principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">To help the Member States translate this principle in more transparent terms, we have proposed to better clarify the objectives in terms of quality and safety standards for health care provided on their territory to patients from other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also introduced a provision so as to ensure that patients from other Member States shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of the Member State of treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the directive clarifies the entitlements of patients and related conditions to receive health care in another Member State. For instance, for people in border regions, it may be easier to seek health care abroad rather than travelling long distances to the nearest relevant domestic health facility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The added value of cross-border health care is also evident for people seeking highly specialised treatment, which only a very limited number of practitioners in Europe can provide. This might be the case, for example, for rare diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality, however, is that most patients are simply unaware that they have the right to seek health care in another EU country, and that they are entitled to reimbursement for such treatment. And, even if they are aware of this right, the rules and procedures are often far from clear. This is what we aim to clarify with this new directive: patients will all get the same clear information and guarantees on cross-border health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">In practice, as long as the treatment is covered under their national health-care system, patients will be allowed to receive that treatment abroad and be reimbursed up to the cost of the same or similar treatment at home.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also clarifying that, under specified circumstances, Member States are entitled to introduce limits on the reimbursement or payment of hospital health care obtained abroad through prior authorisation, if there is a clear risk – even potential – of undermining the national health system.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to this, the Directive clarifies the definitions of hospital and non-hospital care and in that way simplifies the procedures and conditions to access cross-border health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">In such a context, I would like to stress that we have maintained the possibility to expand the concept of ‘hospital care’ to some health care which does not necessarily require hospitalisation, but which is by nature costly or needs a heavy infrastructure to be properly delivered.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, the directive establishes a new framework for European cooperation in areas that we have identified as key areas for the future and where we must act together at EU level to better meet the challenges ahead of us. This is done in line with the principles I mentioned earlier through streamlined and improved cooperation, through common technical guidance and through a systematic search for best practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">This framework will provide for developing enhanced future collaboration at European level in areas such as European reference networks, with a view to pooling together expertise, knowledge and medical skills, both for applied medical research and for diagnosis and treatment. In particular, this will be very important in the field of rare diseases, the provision of new therapies, as well as the rapid spread of new health technologies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second area is health-technology assessment, whereby the most efficient therapies will be identified at EU level by the best experts from the Member States, and spread in order to promote their use. Indeed, as regards new therapies and their high costs, the resources available being limited, we must ensure that they will be chosen and used in the most efficient possible way.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third area is e-Health, where it is time to promote technical requirements to ensure interoperability at all levels and help to establish – at least – e-Health as an integral part of health-care services of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, there is a need for a wider approach at EU level on the collection of health data related to cross-border health care in order to better monitor the effects of the proposed measures and enhance our epidemiological surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, there is the facilitation of the recognition of medical prescriptions in all Member States. However, we must note that prescriptions issued in another Member State will be reimbursed by the patient’s country of origin, only if the medicine is approved and eligible for reimbursement in his country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us also be clear that this initiative is not about harmonising health-care systems. It is not about changing roles in the management of health care. Member States are responsible for deciding how to organise their respective systems, what benefits they provide to their citizens and what treatments and medicines they will pay for. This will remain the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">For now and for the future, what we want with this draft legislation is to grant patients the opportunities and information to access the safest, best-quality and most suitable treatment wherever that treatment is available in Europe. More cooperation between health systems will also create more solidarity and more health-care availability.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of the proposed legislation is, indeed, to pave the way for better health care across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive is already being discussed, as was said by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, in the Council, and I hope that the discussions will proceed swiftly in Parliament as well and that ultimately they will bear fruit.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="4527" name="John Bowis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, we all know that question on the doorstep: what does Europe do for me? Here is an answer: Europe is providing a new opportunity for patients. That is good news; we just have to make sure it works, and we will work together – the three institutions, and certainly within this Parliament – to make it work. But we are talking about court judgments. We are not talking about a blank sheet of paper, so we are not starting from afresh. We have to take into account those judgments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those judgments, in laymen’s terms, are that, if you are facing undue delay for treatment, you have the right to go to another Member State, to have that treatment and have the bill sent back home, so long as the cost is comparable and so long as the treatment is normally available. That is straightforward. When I produced my patient mobility report in this Parliament, it was overwhelmingly accepted. Above all, we said, this must be a decision of politicians, and not of lawyers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, to quote Jean Giraudoux, ‘No poet has ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth.’</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we want politicians and not lawyers interpreting this. That is why we want legal certainty, so that everyone knows where they stand: governments, health services, patients, doctors. And it is why we must make it work for patients and for health services. It must be an opportunity and not a nightmare back home for health-service managers.</p>
      <p sl="de">So we have questions. We have questions that the patient has the right to have answers to. Do I qualify? If I do, how do I proceed? What are the checks that I can carry out on where I might be going and who the doctor might be? What is the choice? What is the confidentiality requirement? And what happens if something goes wrong?</p>
      <p sl="de">Those are all questions for which we must find the answer. And then there are issues we have to discuss among ourselves; some of them have been raised already.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, prior authorisation. My instinct is that, for in-patient hospital care, it is fair to have prior authorisation. The Court did not say that this was wrong in itself; it said it is wrong to refuse it under certain circumstances, so we need to look at that very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to look at the issue of prescriptions. Yes, I understand that the home state must have the decision on what is prescribed, but if you are prescribed a course of drugs as part of your treatment in another Member State and you go back home and they say you cannot have the rest of that course, where does that leave the patient? That is the sort of question we have to answer.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another issue is reimbursement. The patient does not want to have to go with a pocketful of cash. There must be a way of having the bill sent back home, I believe through a central clearing house.</p>
      <p sl="de">But this is a measure for patients – not for services, that is for another day. It is patients who are at the centre of this – patients, not lawyers – and it is for all patients, not just for a few.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="1183" name="Dagmar Roth-Behrendt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking today about a proposal that truly does focus on people in the European Union, namely patients. I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her introduction, but I also wish to express my gratitude to Mr Kyprianou for all the groundwork he has done at a difficult time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why do I call it a difficult time? Because in many instances the Member States are still the last fossils left in this European Union, cast in stone, failing to understand that people are the focal point and believing that the world revolves around them and their systems. That is not the case. The focus is on patients, and they are the weakest links in our society, because they are ill and infirm.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we talk about patient mobility today, knowing that it is actually a right in the internal market, which means that it ought to have applied for more than twenty years, we should consider whether this is a timely debate and whether the Member States are abreast of the times. I tell you they are not! If the Eurobarometer is showing us today that 30% of all people in the European Union are unaware of their right to obtain treatment outside their own country, this means that all the Member States have been getting it wrong. They have not informed people of their rights; they have not been telling them what they are entitled to do and which options are open to patients.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, I share the view of Mr Bowis and others here, and the Commissioner too, that the Member States should certainly retain their autonomous health systems. We have no wish to interfere with that, but we also want to ensure that patients have freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="de">In connection with Member States’ autonomy, I also recognise the need to be able to plan ahead, particularly when it comes to in-patient treatment. For this reason, authorisation will have to be one of the main topics of our discussions. Mr Bowis has already made that point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Networks and information points must ensure that patients know what they are allowed to do, but they must also know where the best treatment is available – whether it be in Germany or in Cyprus – so that patients also have the opportunity to be cured.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we succeed in improving the quality of health care and people’s access to health care close to home, that will surely be a marvellous achievement, and no one need shop around anymore. That is what we really want.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="4501" name="Jules Maaten" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Minister Bachelot-Narquin, last week I attended a presentation of a new website on patient rights in all the EU languages, organised by my Danish colleague in the ALDE Group, Karen Riis-Jørgensen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There was a lady there from Denmark who very nearly might not have been. She had breast cancer and was not getting anywhere under the Danish system because she had the wrong number of tumours. If she had had five tumours she would have been treated, but she had seven and did not qualify under the criteria. So somehow or other she needed to get rid of two tumours before she could be helped. In short, an unending struggle. In the end she found help in Germany. She did it – she borrowed money from friends and family and went to Germany where she was helped. Her secondaries have now disappeared. She is cured, to the extent that you can ever say you are cured of cancer.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is inhuman to make someone like that, an individual, battle against a system at a time when they are sick, at a time when they are as weak as they could possibly be. That is putting the system before the patient. I find it totally unacceptable! The Danes did in the end pay for much of the treatment, and all was well in the end. But what that woman had to go through was not exceptional; it happens all too often.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So the European Commission's proposal is a huge step forward to help these patients and my group is very keen to support it. We also need to ensure that this debate does not turn into an ideological debate. This is not just another directive about health services. This is not about how to reform health in the European Union. It is not about whether or not there should be a free market in healthcare. To my mind it is not really a matter of subsidiarity either. The question is not whether the Member States prevail or the Union. No, the question is whether or not the patient wins out. That is all that matters really. We shall definitely have to talk about all these other things, perhaps argue about them robustly during the election campaign, but in my view and that of my group they are not our concern today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are not trying to harmonise health, now is not the right time for that and maybe it cannot be done anyway. But we must learn to make use of the opportunities which the European Union offers us, the economies of scale we can benefit from, so that real specialist help can be provided to people with rare medical conditions. That possibility has of course existed for years, but now we really can make use of it and we must.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude: last week Parliament also held a meeting hosted by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt at which the European Patient Forum outlined its manifesto. I am glad to see patients banging the drum, because it is patient input that we need. We are poised now to take a democratic decision, following the lead given by the lawyers. But the decision will now be taken by the right people, namely the elected representatives of the people.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="28372" name="Ryszard Czarnecki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the UEN Group">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is a shame that we did not have the opportunity to discuss this particular issue during the previous session, when we were discussing the two previous legislative proposals. But, as the saying goes, better late than never. We are pleased to see that the Commission’s proposals really do go in the direction requested by the European Parliament, in the direction in which the European Parliament encouraged the Commission to go in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If Europe is really to be a Europe without borders then this has, first of all, to be in the area of healthcare. Guaranteeing healthcare to the inhabitants of our Member States will show that we have really done something for European taxpayers and voters. After all, what the average Pole, as well as the average Hungarian, Cypriot, Englishman and Italian are interested in, much more than the Lisbon Treaty, is whether they will be able to access healthcare abroad during their holidays, or even if they can make a special trip to take advantage of a highly specialised hospital.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I believe that the measures that we are discussing today could really improve healthcare for foreigners and at the same time increase the authority of the EU, an authority that has recently been shaken by ideological debates and by trying to impose unwanted institutional solutions onto EU citizens.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="4531" name="Jean Lambert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome very much the statement that has been made, certainly, by Council on this particular directive and the limits and context of it. As Parliament’s rapporteur on the update of the coordination of social security, and indeed its rapporteur on the implementing regulation, I have a very specific interest in this because questions about reimbursement – how it is provided, what information is given, the speed and method of it etc. – come within the scope of that particular regulation. I think that when we are talking about issues such as health care for people who are on holiday elsewhere in the European Union, we should remember that comes under the European Health Card and under the coordination of social security. That is clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">What this directive is aiming to do is to pick up some of the issues which are not necessarily dealt with in that particular regulation, and I think we need to be careful where the dividing line is on that. The question of prior authorisation has of course been an extremely important one. I think we need to be clear that we are not talking necessarily about an absolute right of patients to move and be treated within the European Union under their national systems, in terms of their national systems reimbursing them. It is a qualified right and I think we need to be clear on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we also need to be clear that what this directive is proposing, as I understand it, is that what will be paid for is care that will be available under the national system, not new or different treatments, so that again qualifies the right that we are talking about in terms of this particular directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no question that prior authorisation needs to be managed better, and that not only the patients but also the administrations involved need to understand what that is and how it should operate speedily in terms of medical need. That is the criterion set down by the Court: medical need. Administrations therefore need to reflect that, not necessarily their own cost basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a lot to be welcomed in this directive, and issues around best practice, issues about quality, legal certainty, who is responsible, are also important. As John Bowis has mentioned, we also need to take steps forward on questions, for example, about continuing care or prescriptions which may not be valid in one Member State because of their own systems. But we also need to be careful – and this applies to the implementing regulation on 883, as it does to this – that we should not be in the business of helping patients make a profit by playing different systems off against each other. I do not think that health-care systems benefit from that whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to make clear on behalf of my group that increasing the amount of cross-border care is not of itself a goal. Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that most patients wish to be treated at home and have the quality and speed of treatment there, so increasing the amount in itself, as I say, is not a goal. A lot of claims are being made about the effects of trying to increase the amount of cross-border care which I think we need to be wary of, and I am glad the debate has reflected that.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are people who are arguing that this introduces competition, that this drives up national standards, and that we even need to open the market as a reason for actually increasing and encouraging cross-border health care. However, this Parliament has made its position very clear: health is not a service like car insurance. It has a very particular role and its users are not simply consumers, but people in need and potentially vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of those who tell us that increasing cross-border health care is a good thing will also reassure us that it only covers 2-3%. I want to know what the estimates are for the future and what the effect of this will be on the 98% of people who do not move and currently do not want to.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I cannot share the optimism of fellows Members, since I am convinced that this directive may well do more for business than for health: a kind of Bolkestein directive, but on health.</p>
      <p sl="it">The crucial point for Europe has to be that every citizen must have the right to the best possible treatment in his or her own country; the sacrosanct right to be treated anywhere will otherwise mask the fact that treatment is not available at home – something that cannot be put down to questions of subsidiarity. It also masks the interests of those keen to speculate on health, providing big business for insurance companies and increasing costs for citizens as well as European health spending.</p>
      <p sl="it">A directive which is, in my view, mistaken, because it pays no attention to harmonisation, to the universal nature of the service that Europe must ensure, and is not based on the notion that health is a right which has to be guaranteed by the public sector and not left to people’s ability to take out private insurance.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the central feature of this package – travelling for non-hospital treatment outside the home country – is funding by the home country, but limited to the amount it would have cost there. So there are benefits in going to a country where treatment is cheaper, as long as it is better. Health tourists will have to find the difference between the costs where treated and the home country’s base of provision. Yes, travel costs are paid, ultimately by the home country, but at the home country’s own level, leaving the health tourist to find the treatment top-up and probably travel cost excess. The poorest cannot afford to do this and they are left with the lowest standard of treatment. The rich can do it, but they will probably go for private care anyway. Regarding waiting lists, if a country’s health care is poor and expensive they will not be troubled by health tourists, but where it is cheap and good they could soon be overburdened. This, therefore, produces a two-tier health care system. Is that what they call an unintended consequence?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, four out of every hundred citizens in Europe go abroad for treatment; in my view, however, health tourism is symptomatic of local shortcomings and a lack of services. The Italian health service spends some EUR 40 million a year on Italians who go for treatment in other countries, and that obviously does not include private insurance.</p>
      <p sl="it">What are the reasons for this? Without a doubt the very long waiting lists for services. In Italy, for instance, people have to wait 300 days for a prostate operation and very often a month or more for a CAT scan. Secondly, services such as dental treatment and cosmetic surgery have to be paid for in Italy and not in other countries. Thirdly – and I draw everyone’s attention to this – people go abroad to take advantage of techniques such as artificial fertilisation which are prohibited or partly prohibited in their own countries, or which are absolutely illegal as in the case of purchase of live organs – while India is a sad example, there may well have been equally sad examples in other countries before their accession to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">All in all, people decide to embark on health tourism because high-quality and less expensive services are on offer; in many cases, however, I feel that supervision by the Union needs to be tightened up both as a guarantee for consumers and to ensure that competition is on an equal footing. The social context in which services are provided is often a mixture of public and private, in those countries which have recently acceded as well, and, Mrs Vassiliou, I would therefore recommend, over and above the principles on which you have focused, strict supervision of compliance with existing regulations which make the use of raw materials, the CE mark and conformity documents compulsory, because the salubriousness of medical devices and treatments has to be guaranteed.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, now we European parliamentarians have a chance to show that we are just that, European parliamentarians. That we are standing up for the Treaty and the rights it gives us. That we are legislating with the patients’ best interests at heart, not to protect and support the protectionism which sometimes informs the debate. That we are committed to finding added value in cooperating to give our patients the best possible care, wherever that may be.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The proposal that Commissioner Vassiliou has presented is a good starting point and to be applauded. We must complete what she has begun and ensure that no unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles are introduced. To spell it out, that means that the Member States have no right to prevent free movement without reason. Requirements for prior authorisation may be imposed only in exceptional cases – if they are specified on the Commission’s list or if there is a risk of a mass exodus of patients which would undermine the health system. The idea that it might be imposed because so few patients have chosen to seek care abroad is highly unlikely. Thus the starting point is: no prior authorisation. Anything else would be contrary to the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The next stage in this work on creating the conditions for optimum care is to implement the directive correctly. Sick people should not have to go to court in order to validate their rights and to get unjustified requirements for prior authorisation overruled. The Court of Justice will rule in favour of freedom of movement, but at what cost in terms of money and the health of patients who have to seek enforcement of their rights every time! I really hope that we can escape that experience, and I call on my fellow Members and the President-in-Office to help us; I am quite convinced that our Commissioner will help us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following my own-initiative report on health services that Parliament adopted on 23 May 2007, the Commission is now proposing, as part of the social package, a directive addressed solely at patients’ rights in regard to cross-border health care.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am, therefore, very sorry this text shows so little ambition and does not take account of the many internal challenges that need to be resolved in order to combat the growing inequalities in the health sector, such as the ageing population, social inequalities, geographical segregation and medical demography problems. On an issue that is so vital to the citizens of Europe, the Council and Parliament cannot, therefore, simply codify the Court of Justice’s rulings. We need to find a certain balance, which will safeguard both the rights of patients – who are not merely consumers – to cross-frontier care, and equal access for all to quality care, with solidarity-based responsibility; to ensure social and territorial cohesion and respect for the principle of subsidiarity. There is still a worrying grey area in relation to definitions, such as prior authorisation and the concept of hospital care. We need clarification here, so as not to open the door to discrimination that might give rise to a two-speed health system within Europe instead of creating added value in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Health has no price but does have a cost; the directive, on the other hand – and that is a good thing – reaffirms both the principle of subsidiarity and the need for closer cooperation to bring the medical research networks and patient information centres closer together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The debate will begin; it must be an in-depth and fruitful debate, rather than a precipitate one, and must be shared by all the players involved, with the object of constructing a genuine European social model.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, why should a patient have to lose their sight waiting for a cataract operation in the UK, for instance, when it could be done in another Member State? And why should a person waiting in agony for a hip operation not be able to take advantage of the lack of waiting lists in some Member States, sometimes at a lesser cost to the country of origin? And why do some heart patients have to wait months to have surgery to unblock arteries when there really is no need?</p>
      <p sl="en">If a clinician advises treatment, and this cannot be provided at home, then we need a legal framework to ensure that we can seek it elsewhere. All too often it is the poorest people that face discrimination and inequality in access to health care. That is why we must ensure that Member States can authorise treatment in another country prior to that treatment. We must not restrict cross-border health care just to those who can afford it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, this new directive must not compromise standards of care for those people who do chose to stay at home. We must also ensure that there are safeguards in place that put the rights and safety of the patients first. That is why it is vital that a mechanism is developed to share patients’ records between the patients’ home country and the country where they receive treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from that, we need to develop a system of compensation for patients who suffer avoidable harm when being treated in another country EU country. And, with regards to the sharing of best practice, I welcome Article 15 in the draft directive which calls for a system of European reference networks. These centres of excellence could prove a useful way of sharing knowledge, training and the exchange of information. All too often we look at health-care-acquired infections or cancer-screening guidelines; the answer is on our doorstep, and it is about time that we started learning from each other more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the directive means that more power will be given to the EU over healthcare, and I am opposed to opening up this field to EU legislation. Healthcare is and must remain a national prerogative. The idea that patients should engage in a form of healthcare tourism is an incorrect prioritisation of our common healthcare resources. The new fundamental principle that we should have a right to care in another EU country without prior authorisation opens up a fast lane to care for young, linguistically talented and relatively healthy persons and poses the risk of diverting resources from those with greater care needs, such as our elderly and those with functional impairments. Clearly everyone should have the right to care if they are sick in another EU country, but we already have that right without the need for new EU legislation in the field. Healthcare remains a national policy area.</p>

If they are unlucky, they receive none at all. Therefore, we must lay down some basic principles. There should be free and equal access to healthcare services for all, and people should be treated in turn and according to need. That is to say, a public authority must carry out an assessment to ensure that a medical professional determines what constitutes ‘turn’ and ‘need’. It is the sickest who should be treated first, not the richest. A way forward in terms of free and equal access to healthcare services for all citizens would be to scrutinise public contributions to treatment in private hospitals and tax credits for private health insurance. EU legislation should not be oriented towards an ideological school of thought based on the internal market, but should aim towards a flexible system in Europe, which guarantees minimum rights for all citizens in terms of treatment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare endeavours to solve an acute problem.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This problem is the conflict between the subsidiarity of healthcare systems and the right of European Union citizens to free movement, and also their fundamental human right of access to health services. Free movement is the right of any citizen living in a Member State and his health moves with him. Should he not be able to approach health services, he would face a serious obstacle hindering his free movement. Complete equality of services is impossible because of different taxes paid in individual countries in respect of health services, as well as differing rates of treatment in individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Although many politicians worry about the onset of health tourism, especially from the East, their fears are unsubstantiated. A very important thing for a patient is to be close to his relatives and not to face a language barrier. The patient-doctor relationship is very specific. The success of treatment partially depends on a patient’s trust in his doctor or in the health establishment. A patient’s readiness to travel abroad to get treatment depends on the seriousness of the illness. In cases of life-saving treatment or treatment of a serious illness, no other obstacles matter.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think it would be preferable for these issues to be dealt with by the European Parliament rather than by the European Court of Justice. It is sad that, although we are the citizens’ representatives, we find making decisions more difficult than the European Court of Justice which, in each case so far, has found that the patient was right.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I should like to mention one thing in conclusion. Many of my fellow Members talk about the rich and the poor. For me, as a doctor, there is only the patient. I do not care whether he owns a Ford or is homeless.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, to begin with, may I say how delighted I am to see our erstwhile colleague, Roselyn Bachelot, here with us today and hear her telling us once again that the European citizen is all-important. This piece of legislation reflects that emphasis. My compliments also go to Commissioner Vassiliou, who has seen this very difficult item of legislation through.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With this legislation we – the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council – really are doing something for people. The directive provides legal safeguards for mobility and at the same time offers a statutory basis for existing initiatives in the area of cross-border healthcare.</p>
      <p sl="nl">But when I compare this directive with the earlier versions, those which were opposed, I see that the focus is now more on patient mobility and less on health services, and the reason for that is to keep the Member States happy. I have a word or two of criticism about that. Border areas that have already taken some good initiatives on cross-border healthcare – for example the cooperative arrangement between the Universitätsklinikum Aachen and the Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht in my own province of Limburg, which as part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion would dearly love to be a pilot area – are becoming far too dependent on mobility alone and thus on the whims of insurers or the goodwill or otherwise of national authorities, because the focus is now no longer on the services themselves. We should take a good look at Article 13 to decide how we can get regions working together a lot more. And whilst I am on the subject, Commissioner, may I make the point that we in the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion are very keen to be a pilot area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, patient involvement in setting up national contact points. Mrs Schmidt in Germany has taken an excellent initiative on this and we should look at how we might tie that in more closely to our own wider plans.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another point is the ‘list of treatments, other than those requiring overnight accommodation, to be subject to the same regime as hospital care’, the purpose of which is to exclude certain functions from this directive. This needs careful consideration too, because we cannot have a situation where an overly strict interpretation of that list rules out cooperative ventures of the kind I mentioned just now. It is most important to know that effective cooperation makes centres of clinical excellence cheaper, not more expensive, and more readily accessible to people. That, after all, is what we are aiming for.</p>

      <p sl="en">It was very clear to me that citizens are very interested in the EU becoming more involved in social policy, and that certainly includes patient mobility. Indeed, the call for more social Europe was reinforced during the Lisbon Treaty campaign, and this response from the Commission, while not fully addressing the concerns of citizens, is timely and a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly welcome the proposals on patient mobility, but agree with some of the previous speakers that very many issues still need to be clarified – in particular, the issue of prior authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the bottom line is that patients must be at the core of any policy and should have no worries about costs, safety and quality.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the mean time, patients must be fully informed of their existing rights, since legal uncertainty always works to the disadvantage of individuals who do not have many personal resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the French presidency referred to the fact earlier that some people will be disappointed that the issue of the mobility of health-care professionals has not been dealt with. I am one of those people. If we are to put patients at the core of any policy, then patient safety is paramount, so we must establish standardised accreditation systems for health-care professionals throughout the EU.</p>

Similarly, it is essential to apply the principle that a patient has the right to a refund of costs up to the value of what would be paid if the patient had used healthcare in their own country until such a time as the differences in development between the old and the new Member States have become significantly less.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally it is worth emphasising that the proposed solutions, particularly as regards the introduction of the European Reference Network, and also the European Network for Health Technology Assessment, provide an opportunity to raise the standards of medical care and also to make more effective use of healthcare resources in the European Union.</p>

I approve of the fact that, thanks to the negotiations that have taken place so far, citizens are closer to a solution. Being a physician, I should like to see the necessary documents adopted as soon as possible, but I assume that the matter is so complex that the old Roman adage of ‘hurry up slowly’ applies here. At present, I think that the following fundamental issues should be debated. Firstly, we all agree that it is necessary to ensure legal protection for patients who have the right to healthcare within the European Union, in keeping with the judicial decisions of the European Court of Justice. Secondly, it is not possible for the directive to establish new competences for the Commission because they are not vital. Thirdly, I think it is erroneous that, although the basic purpose was to ensure free movement of medical services, the text of the directive itself concentrates, first and foremost, on movement of patients in need of non-urgent healthcare.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this issue is about the right of the individual to seek healthcare where good care is available. The representative of the Group of the European United Left, Eva-Britt Svensson, said here earlier today that it will lead to healthcare tourism. I would like to inform her that, when sick people seek care, it is because they are in pain, they are suffering, they are damaged, and they need care. It is not about tourism.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ultimately, this question is about the power of bureaucracy versus the right of the individual. It is about whether old frontiers should be used as a barrier to people seeking healthcare or whether the openness of today’s Europe should be used as a means for people throughout Europe to get the best healthcare they can. It was illuminating to hear what the Group of the Left thinks but, since I have the representative of the Social Democrats, Jan Andersson, in front of me and he is right after me on the speakers’ list, it would be interesting to hear from him whether he shares Eva-Britt Svensson’s view that sick people who seek care abroad are engaging in healthcare tourism. Does he, like her, want to erect barriers of various kinds or will you, will the Social Democrats, work to ensure that we have the greatest possible openness, in which patients do not need to ask permission from the authorities to get healthcare?

There are considerable advantages, particularly for people who live in border areas, as I do myself. That said, I would also point out that it is important to link the arrangements to the various systems around Europe, in terms of organisation, financing and similar aspects.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is one aspect that we must pay particular attention to. That is equality. We know that there is prioritisation in healthcare, but it is important that people are all treated equally and that some should not be able to take precedence because of their resources, and it is important that we should be able to combine these two aspects in cross-border care. The question of prior approval is also important. That is something to which we must devote further discussion. The limit specified in the directive is not good. Inpatient care, outpatient care: it varies considerably from one country to another, and the pattern changes over time. We must find other criteria. I look forward to cooperation.

The healthcare landscape of Europe is also changing. Success rates in the case of some diseases are on the increase, as is spending on running healthcare systems. However, citizens encounter huge differences in the quality of healthcare, both between the Member States and within them. Cancer survival rates differ by as much as 10% between the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I welcome the European Commission’s intention to look closely at the issue of healthcare within the framework of a renewed social agenda. At the same time, however, I regret that the increased attention paid to citizens’ health-related rights has come about solely as a result of a judgment of Court of Justice. I speak as someone who has himself survived cancer and who knows of cases where patients have been told ‘there is nothing more we can do for you’ in one country and received effective care in another.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Freedom of movement means the ability to choose. The ability to choose leads to greater competition and thus greater quality and possibly also lower costs. I am sure that the directive on patient mobility will enliven Europe and have many positive consequences. Our common goal is health for all.

      <p sl="de">The third priority is that we must remember time and time again that, under the European treaties, healthcare in the Member States is a matter for the Member States, and we must respect that. In other words, the organisation and funding of healthcare systems are the responsibility of the Member States, and our legislation can do nothing to change that. It is not an option, we cannot do it, and we have no intention of doing it unless we were able to agree at some future date to create a common health policy. That would be the ideal scenario, but I am afraid we are still far from ready to take such a step.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we and the people of Europe are pleased that we can finally begin the parliamentary discussion of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regret that the threats the PSE Group made to the Commission last December resulted in a deadlock lasting several months. The proposal is good and provides added value for the people of Europe. We want to see the political creation of cross-border legal certainty, so that individuals no longer have to resort to the Court of Justice to assert their fundamental right to personal freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are discussing a directive on patient mobility, not on health services. Primary responsibility for the assured delivery, the quality and the funding of health care continues to rest with the Member States. We know, however, that we need more cooperation among the Member States in the field of health care and more cross-border European input in research, in the key area of hospital provision and on the supply side.</p>
      <p sl="de">This question is the free movement of patients. We are not asking whether health-care systems and high-quality health services can be organised without unwanted side-effects; we are asking how it can be done. We are moving in an area between four poles: patients’ rights, protection of the healthcare systems, protection of health insurance schemes and quality assurance with regard to health services, security of funding and legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="de">Patients have a legitimate interest in seeking out what seems to be the best health service. To enable them to do so, we need a legislative framework and legal certainty. On the other hand, the great majority of the population want health services as close as possible to their own homes. We have the problem of funding the system of health care in the Member States. More mobility at the same cost is therefore the right way forward. We have the issue of quality assurance with regard to health services. We should launch the debate on European minimum standards in this area too.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I share the view of other Members that it is an important achievement to have this proposal on the table at last. It meets a need, a reality on the ground and it means we can really do something for people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Some members claim that only the well-off will be able to get themselves treated abroad. We must make sure that healthcare abroad is accessible not only to the most affluent, because they are able to use the law to obtain expensive procedures. Patients have a right to clarity and legal certainty and we can work on that, that is our job.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The proposal is a distinct plus for EU citizens. It is not perfect, of course, there are a few improvements to be made. I am thinking of the definitions of 'hospital', 'non-hospital care' and so on and the identification of specific cases where prior authorisation may be warranted. These are things we shall certainly address in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So I hope our debate will be calm and pragmatic and not an ideologically based debate. Other aspects will need to be dealt with by national legislation, but I absolutely cannot agree with those who say that this proposal undermines the ability of Member States to organise their healthcare. I think it most important that we discuss this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Responsibility for the health systems in the Union rests first and foremost with Member States. Responsibility for the organisation and provision of healthcare and medical services in accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty is fully recognised.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The proposal aims to introduce and ensure a transparent framework for the provision of safe, high-quality and effective cross-border healthcare within the Union, at the same time ensuring a high level of health protection while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Although I wholeheartedly approve of the intention and goals set in the directive, I should like to point out certain shortcomings of the proposal that could be overcome.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Some are afraid that this type of care might place the health insurance systems in some Member States under undue pressure. We need a more precise definition of procedures relating to providing care and reimbursement in respect of repeated hospitalisations and damages, as well as treating complications. We must set a time horizon for reimbursement of costs and at the same time clearly state that the directive neither will not wants to solve the long-term healthcare issues in such establishments where the health and social systems usually meet.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The term ‘beneficial for the patient’ must be specified. The medical aspects should be taken into consideration in the first place, not subjective benefits. When specifying the terms ‘hospital care’ and ‘outpatient care’, it would also be good to specify the term ‘specialised outpatient healthcare’. In addition to that, the problem of the method of reimbursement of prescriptions issued in other countries still remains.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said that health services are a major pillar of the European social model. For that reason, it seems entirely right that we should address the issue with a view to ensuring a high level of health protection and equal access to healthcare for all; unfortunately, the text under discussion does not seem to be moving in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to avoid striking at the roots of the purpose for which the directive should be issued, and that is to guarantee, within the framework of free movement, the right of citizens to take advantage of health services within the Union. In practice, the text can be seen as an instrument geared towards opening up the health market at Community level, something which is quite different and could well lead to a right to health for the well-off.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text provides solely for the reimbursement of the costs paid by them and only the cost of the health service as compared with the cost in the country of origin, disregarding the costs of travelling to and staying in the host country. Further critical points have also been discussed, ranging from the need to guarantee standards of service at Community level to the important issue of information.</p>
      <p sl="it">For those reasons, I consider that more detailed thought is needed so that we can try together to provide European citizens with the answers that are still lacking in the directive itself.</p>

      <p sl="ro">First of all, I would like to welcome the entire proposal made by the Commission regarding a new social package. The necessity of modernising the European social model is obvious in the specific context of the 21st century and of the objectives sought in the Lisbon Strategy concerning sustained economic growth and the prosperity of the population.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The directive currently under debate is important in the enforcement of the renewed social agenda, particularly in the context of priorities related to the promotion of geographic and professional mobility, as well as to a longer and healthier life of European citizens. I hope that the provisions of the directive will bring healthcare services closer to home, and I am referring to all social categories, including emigrants, people working abroad and undergraduates studying abroad.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is essential that healthcare should provide secure, quality services, no matter where in Europe it is provided. In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of education and training of European professionals in the field, as well as the importance of facilitating European communication and the exchange of good practice. Given the crossborder nature of the directive, professional training should include knowledge of foreign languages and familiarity with the fundamentals of intercultural dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Not least, adequate knowledge of information and communication technology is just as necessary for the success of the directive; moreover, it is crucial in strengthening the so-called field of e-health.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The provision of healthcare services is a pillar of the European social model, and the creation of an internal market for these services should not encourage medical tourism, which will be available only to well-off patients who can speak many foreign languages and have access to information.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is required is a clarification of the conditions for the reimbursement and licensing of healthcare, as well as a clarification of the concept of healthcare. I am concerned about the effects that this directive will have on the new Member States. European citizens will not travel to countries where healthcare is very expensive; on the contrary, they will go to countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, or Poland, leading to an exodus of patients from Western Europe to Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although healthcare provision in the new Member States in accordance with clearly defined standards of quality and security does not apply uniformly to all types of healthcare, the demand for dental services in Eastern Europe is constantly increasing. This will cause prices to soar in the host countries, rendering their citizens’ access to healthcare more difficult, owing both to high prices and to the fact that certain companies will look for customers willing to pay more.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Opening up the European market in healthcare services will have a severe impact on the healthcare system in Eastern Europe, leading to inequality. Increased freedom of choice in the manner and location of healthcare provision is a positive thing, as long as all citizens have access to services, irrespective of their social standing.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the aim of the social package should be to guarantee universal and equal access to high quality healthcare services to all EU citizens. To a certain extent, this objective can be reached by appropriate regulation at European Union level, but there are many problems that result from mistaken and ineffective solutions at the level of individual Member States. For this reason, the Commission should encourage Member States to reform their national healthcare systems, primarily through spreading good practice and through effective financing methods.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A precondition for effective healthcare is the free movement of medical personnel between Member States. In this context I must draw your attention to the restrictions that continue to apply to Polish nurses and midwives wishing to work abroad. This is discrimination against Polish workers and is a blatant breach of the principle of free movement of labour and the principle of equal treatment. I call on the Commission to put an end to these discriminatory practices and to give back to Polish nurses the right to carry out their profession, without restrictions, in other European Union countries.</p>

Since this is a complex problem, I welcome this debate.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Clear and understandable information must be available to the patient even before he requests healthcare in another EU Member State, in particular regarding the level of treatment costs, the possibility of being reimbursed by his health insurer and the need for prior authorisation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, many speakers stress the fact that all patients, whether they travel or stay at home, are entitled to high-quality, safe health care. Let us not forget that one of the biggest demographic challenges we have is an ageing population who will inevitably want health care in their own locality. So we need clarity to respect the right of patients to access health services, and at the same time we need to respect the Treaty provision stating that the organisation of health services, especially financing, is a competence of the Member States. We must recognise that 27 states have different systems, different funding systems. I regret that the directive is not clear on this point, but I have confidence that our rapporteurs can clarify these issues: if we want to keep out the lawyers we must have clarity, not just to avoid patients going to court, but to avoid them going to court on cross-border medical negligence issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we need to have more innovation in our approach. The ideal mix, I believe, is to have patient mobility and to encourage Member States to buy in expert services, not just to treat one patient but to treat groups suffering from the same condition. This could be more cost-efficient, and could enable patients to stay close to family and friends.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this directive is wonderful in theory, but it could turn out to be a nightmare in practice. I say this because it could lead to services getting better in some centres but worse in others. I will give you an example: if patients from a small country like Cyprus with a neurosurgical problem all go to Sweden or Britain to have their neurosurgical treatment, then what will happen to the neurosurgical services in Cyprus? The standards will diminish, inevitably, and this holds for cardiovascular services, for orthopaedic services, for oncological services and for many others. So we must be very careful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support this directive, but we must make sure that we do not make good centres better and bad centres worse. We must be careful to raise the health standards right across Europe, in large countries as well as in small countries.</p>

A very important issue here is the proposal relating to the directive concerning the rights of patients in cross-border healthcare. This is needed for people to be able to function in today’s fast-moving world, where people travel hundreds of kilometres to attend a specific meeting. For this reason it is very important that every European should know that if their lives are in danger, someone will save their life and safeguard their health without unnecessary regulations or other obstacles. We should make sure that every inhabitant of the EU knows that, in order to be able to access healthcare in an emergency, they must have a European Health Insurance Card. Patients must know that, in an emergency, they should be treated on the same basis as the citizens of the country where they are being treated. Quality, productivity and, above all, the safety of patients are the issues that, for us, should be the most important.</p>

I think it incredibly important that politicians have the opportunity to discuss patient rights, rather than it being left to the European Court of Justice to take decisions in such an important area. In my view, patients are of supreme importance. We must put the spotlight on patients, but for this reason we must also reflect on how to orient this Directive, so that the spotlight is on giving all patients the opportunity to receive good treatment. Therefore, I believe it is important to ensure that the Directive enables patients staying at home in their own Member State to have access to proper treatment too. Thus I believe that this prior authorisation should be the rule rather than the exception.</p>
      <p sl="da">This is what I believe we need to focus on. In addition, I would agree with my colleague Mrs Sârbu in what she said about the need for us to take care that this Directive does not create a divide between east and west, north and south in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a few personal comments and say how happy I was to meet up again with my colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Andersson, its chairman, Anne Van Lancker, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, Jiří Maštálka and others. May I offer them my warmest greetings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">John Bowis, speaking on behalf of the PPE, put the issue in its proper context by asking: ‘What does Europe do for me?’ He reintroduced the question of a neighbourhood Europe, followed by numerous others such as Dagmar Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Socialist Party and Jules Maaten for the ALDE Group.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of those who spoke after John Bowis also emphasised that patients take precedence over states and systems. That is very true. Yet we must not end up by opposing patients, states and health insurance systems because any destabilisation of health insurance systems would have dreadful repercussions on the organisation of healthcare and, specifically, on the patients we want to protect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I would reply to Dagmar Roth-Behrendt that the question is not of patients’ right of movement within the European Union, which is a self-evident, fundamental right. The question the directive raises is of reimbursement and reimbursement terms, of the right or not to reimbursement. Article 152 of the Treaty makes it clear that Member States are free to organise and finance the healthcare they provide as they wish.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the heart of the issue of prior authorisation lies the question of balance, of the soundness of the accounts of the national health support and insurance systems, especially those of the poorest states. This text reminds us of that responsibility and under no circumstances can states use this directive as a means of evading those responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Basically, Jean Lambert was saying that cross-border care is not a goal in itself and Derek Roland Clark pointed out that perhaps we should make sure the provisions of the new directive did not ultimately benefit only a few of the wealthiest, most educated and best informed patients while the poorest patients would, of course, be treated unfairly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The key question here, however, the question under debate, which the Commission and the Council should look at in depth, is prior authorisation for hospital care because that is indeed where there is the greatest risk of deregulation of national systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Jean Lambert asked whether the proposal for a directive was compatible with the regulation on social security coordination. The Court has found that those two reimbursement systems were compatible. We must ensure, therefore, that the two systems are properly structured. The proposal for a directive before us gives priority to implementing the regulation, which seems reasonable. Yet the principle of the patient’s freedom of choice must continue to apply if, for any reason other than financial, a patient prefers to go down the road opened by ECJ case law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like Bernadette Vergnaud, some MEPs regretted the fact that this text does not cover all the difficulties encountered by patients within the EU, and more specifically in their country of origin. When you look at the difficulties to be resolved by this text alone, you can see that it was unlikely that proposing a wider-ranging text would have been the best way of making progress in terms of resolving certain very practical problems, such as reimbursing healthcare for patients moving to another European country for the purpose of study, work or simply holidays.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Similarly, this is not just a directive on health services, to be regretted or welcomed. So it serves no useful purpose to decry it as some kind of ‘Bolkestein directive’. That really is not what this directive is about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once its basic principles have been established – and I have noted them – this directive must therefore enable us to preserve a certain means of regulation, as it already exists between the Commission and the Council but also between many MEPs on all benches, in regard to respect for these options open to patients. As regards prior authorisation for cross-border healthcare, Member States must remain responsible for deciding on the range of care they offer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also important that when a state imposes certain conditions of access to care for public health reasons – such as the doctor’s referral system or what is known as gate-keeping in English – its systems are respected and applied when patients turn to a health system in a country other than their own.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, this discussion on the directive cannot be dissociated from the Commission’s forthcoming communication or from the Council’s proposal for a recommendation on Community action in the field of rare diseases. I believe it is entirely possible to hold those discussions at the same time. Another issue that many MEPs raised was the interoperability of health information systems. This directive may contribute to that in legislative terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course we are only at the start of this dialogue, of the discussion on this subject, which will have to cover such vast areas as data protection, transparent enacting terms and perimeters. Here again, however, with the directive creating legal certainty, we should be able to advance along the road of interoperability, which does not mean going it alone but, quite simply, harmonisation and greater compatibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been a very interesting discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say that very often we hear the question: how can we bring the citizen nearer to the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one example of how we can make the citizen feel that the European Union is doing something for him or her. Under the present system, there are many inequalities. With the clear legal framework provided by the draft directive concerning citizens and the various issues we are trying to give clear information to the citizen about their rights and how they can exercise them.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that there are concerns. I listened very carefully to your concerns, and I am sure that during the course of the debate and the deliberations we shall have, we have to address these concerns so that the end result will be something which is really of benefit to the citizen.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a Bolkestein Directive II – far from it – and we should never think that this is so. It is about patients’ rights and how to exercise those rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not trying to harmonise health systems. Member States can continue to exercise and regulate their health systems, and they can decide for themselves what benefits they want to offer to their citizens, and to what extent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not trying to encourage health tourism. We are not trying to give citizens the chance to have their faces and their bodies fixed; rather, we are trying to give citizens the right to have proper health care when they are sick and they need it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nor do we expect a big exodus of European citizens from their home state to another Member State. According to the calculations and to the impact assessment that we have, only a very small percentage of citizens wish to go abroad. Why? Because they want to have the care that they need nearer to their families, they want to speak their own language and to be in a familiar environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are cases when they need some extra health care which their home state cannot provide. This is a right that we give them – this extra right to have an informed choice and decide for themselves where they go for their health treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, we have had encouragement from the European Court of Justice to legislate. We cannot leave it all the time to the Court to decide about the rights of the patient case by case. This is not just. How many European citizens can afford a lawyer and can afford to go to court? Only a very few. Therefore, we must offer solutions to all the patients, give them the right information and let them decide for themselves what they need.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a time for all of us to work together – the Council, the Commission and Members of Parliament – to find the best possible solutions for patients.</p>

The Renewed Social Agenda on cross-border healthcare must address the problems Roma encounter in their failure to have healthcare services within a short distance of their community. Most Roma live on the periphery of urban centres, and miles away from health facilities. Their segregation from these services results in the life expectancy of Roma being estimated at 10 years less than the national average. The prevention of and vaccination against diseases prevalent in Roma communities as well as the question of emergency situations and regular health checks have yet to be resolved. Another factor limiting the access of Roma to healthcare stems from their lack of identity cards, which would enable them to apply for insurance or social assistance. With the fall of the communist regimes, many Roma were not acknowledged, or were forgotten or erased from country citizenship records. Lastly, the health of Roma women must be addressed, as they are the caretakers of the Roma community. If the Commission is to help Europeans obtain healthcare services within the EU, they must ensure this is universally and equally applied.</p>

      <p sl="fi">In a properly functioning Europe, the patient must be able to apply for proper care and treatment wherever it is available. If there are waiting lists for a heart operation or a hip replacement in one country, access to treatment in another country must be possible without any protectionist jungle of legislation. The removal of barriers also means better use of existing resources. Most of the speeches opposing the movement of patients and services appeal to the worst aspects of Europeanness, xenophobia and mistrust. Properly functioning health services, both public and private, are part of the welfare society – the European welfare society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Cross-border healthcare is a key element of the social package. While the EU has facilitated freedom of movement and the right to live and work in other EU countries, clarification regarding patients’ rights to access healthcare in other Member States was urgently required.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite numerous European Court of Justice rulings on this subject, citizens are not fully aware of their rights on this issue. Moreover, they are not adequately informed about their exact entitlements, how to go about arranging treatment, or indeed reimbursements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Northern Ireland, projects have been piloted around the border counties which ensure that people can benefit from the most appropriately located healthcare services. These projects have been very successful and have been very much appreciated by the people who have benefited from them. In this regard, I would like commend the British Medical Association (NI) and the Irish Medical Association for their efforts in promoting cross-border healthcare between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="nl">We are still glad that the European Parliament excluded heath care services from the general directive on services. Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fundamental premise of the proposal, in line with established case-law, has to be that the organisation and funding of healthcare are the responsibility of Member States. This means on the one hand that patient mobility cannot be made an absolute right and on the other hand that there are no excuses for not investing in one's own health system. That premise also necessarily implies that Member States must be able to charge the real cost to the patient. There must be solidarity, but there must also be the possibility of differential treatment for patients who have contributed in their own country through the social security and tax system and foreign patients who have not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact that we have the directive is a good thing, but anyone familiar with the sector feels that it still needs a lot more work. To my mind the quality, accessibility and financial sustainability of healthcare on the basis of socially responsible solidarity remain the key criteria here.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe that access to quality healthcare is one of the essential values of a Social Europe. Patients’ rights within the EU and crossborder cooperation in this field among the Member States constitute a significant part of the new social package. Patients must have access to quality health services in any Member State and they must have the possibility of being reimbursed with amounts that are equal to the amount they would receive in their own country. Today there are significant differences within the EU as regards both the quality of health services and the reimbursable amounts. I believe that an assessment of the European health system and of the medical technology in use is required as a matter of urgency. The appropriate equipment of all hospitals with the technology required to diagnose and treat various conditions is a prerequisite for the provision of quality healthcare. Physicians and nurses move from one Member State to another both in search of better wages and due to the availability of better diagnostic and treatment facilities. It is important that the directive on the patients’ rights include, according to EU priorities, a minimal list of health services which should be fully covered by health insurance budgets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is about the building in Strasbourg and the decision to go back.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Secretary-General sent an e-mail on Tuesday morning saying we would go back in October. I understand there was no vote or decision by the Bureau, which is strange.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Rømer made no mention of the availability of the expert report. I had to rely on information from the Vice-President for Transparency to know that the Secretary-General had told the Bureau he would make it available to Members on request in the French and German versions in which it exists, although he would not translate it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have now sent a total of three e-mails over the last two days asking for the report in French, with no response. I find this unacceptable and I am now raising the matter under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure on accountability and Rule 96 on transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to know the basis on which we are going back to Strasbourg. I have read the note which went to the Bureau on Monday, but it seems to me that the works only relate to the false ceilings. So, firstly, what do we know about the reasons for the collapse? Is it the design, the materials, the quality of construction or the building inspection? It has got to be one of those four.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, what does it tell us about the rest of the building? We do not know whether the whole building has been checked. Are there faulty materials? One rumour is that the steel used in the building is the same as in the Charles de Gaulle airport roof which collapsed. Is that true or not?</p>
      <a text="(Protests)"/>
      <p sl="en">Well, if you do not give us the truth, rumours will proliferate.</p>

      <p sl="es">Rule 45(2) was recently amended to prohibit amendments to motions for resolutions contained in own-initiative reports.</p>
      <p sl="es">The result, as we shall see in the forthcoming vote, is that if a Parliamentary group wishes to amend one line or one paragraph of an own-initiative report, it is required to table a completely separate alternative motion for a resolution where the only difference is one comma, or the insertion or deletion of a single word.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps at the time it seemed like a good idea when the rule was being amended but what is happening now is that it is making it difficult to reach agreements within this Chamber, and reaching agreements should be one of our main objectives. It is impossible to reach any agreement between political groups if the only thing we can do is table a separate text, as we will see in the vote shortly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Mikko report because I believe the media has a vital role to play in safeguarding democracy. With the expansion of the EU it is our role to ensure the convergence of standards for the protection of basic freedoms and democracy. I was involved in the opinion of the ITRE Committee on the Mikko report, and I would like to congratulate her because I think new technologies have led to the emergence of new media channels and new types of content, and the media remains an important political tool. In this context, a pluralistic media system is an essential requirement for the democratic social model.</p>
      <p sl="en">When media ownership is concentrated in just a few people’s hands, this favours the monopolisation of the advertising market and represents a barrier to new entrants. Competition law has helped restrict media concentration, but these problems still remain in a number of Member States where the market is dominated by a few large players.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the report’s suggestion of linking media law and competition law is therefore to be commended.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, media pluralism means diversity in the dissemination of information and the characteristic nature of broadcasters. Both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector. An ever-increasing concentration of ownership among media companies that are competing in this sector has led to a situation where information that is valuable from the social and cultural points of view is difficult to find in the maze of easily accessible and standardised news for everyone. It is difficult to predict what the worsening situation in this sector will lead to, not just for individual consumers, but for society as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The rapporteur was right to emphasise the role of the public sector broadcasters as guardians of diversity, with a mission to broadcast high-quality information. She is also right to propose a model where there are strong public sector media outside the competitive media market coexisting with private media companies that are motivated by profit. There can be no doubt about the importance of balance between these two pillars. The text of the report, as well as the intentions of the rapporteur, seem to be clear and transparent. The compromise reached during the discussions of the Committee on Culture is a good one. In addition, the legal status of the new methods of disseminating information, such as Internet blogs, or other user-generated sites, should be clearly delineated so that the people creating these forms should be aware of their rights and responsibilities and any possible sanctions.</p>

That is quite right and proper. In a normal society that means democracy and freedom of information, and above all freedom of information for opposition groups.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Measured against those criteria, Belgium and even Flanders are not democracies. My political party, for example, a big political party in that country, is routinely and openly discriminated against and boycotted by the Flemish public service broadcaster, and on the basis of official directives to boot. Why? Because our ideas and attitudes are not 'politically correct' or deviate from the prevailing line. Not all that long ago the former head of the public service broadcaster openly admitted that the King of the Belgians had made him a baron to reward him for his discriminatory efforts against the opposition party.</p>

      <p sl="nl">As a Fleming I can offer a word or two on the subject. Because there is no state in the European Union which has more need, for example, of a neutral media ombudsman to ensure freedom of expression and pluralism than Belgium. Here in Brussels, the institutional heart of the country, as my fellow Member has just said, not only the private media but also the organs of government shamelessly boycott the largest opposition party and deny people the right to free and balanced information.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It may be that the charter for media freedom which the rapporteur advocates can make this kind of abuse impossible, otherwise the whole thing will just be pure window-dressing.</p>

There is also the idea that there should be greater transparency in energy markets so that, in future, they should be less susceptible to speculation on world markets. While discussing the issue of energy, one cannot but emphasise the need, first of all, to intensify the work being done on increasing the proportion of energy obtained from renewable sources, including nuclear energy, secondly, the introduction of new coal technologies and thirdly, we must introduce a wide-reaching programme to improve energy efficiency.</p>

In my opinion, the experience of most of the European Union Member States clearly shows that freedom of speech has become almost a myth, and that the character of so-called commercial media is shaped by their owner. The level of objectivity of information provided by statutory media is often significantly determined by the interests of those holding political power, regardless of the statutes and the legislative framework laid down for such media. This makes preventing community and alternative media from being misused, from being allowed to operate outside the limits of the mission that such media are supposed to have, even more important. I agree that these media deserve to get general legal recognition in the countries of the EU. However, the rules that must regulate their activities must be set, from the start, in such a way that will prevent community and alternative media from betraying their mission, their social role.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The amendment of the Rules of Procedure, as adopted by us on 8 July 2008, resulted in new rules on own-initiative reports. During this second September part-session, we have had the opportunity to see how these rules work in practice.</p>
      <p sl="sk">During the Monday evening debate on several own-initiative reports, it turned out, however, that this change was not the most felicitous. Only the rapporteur and a representative of the Commission were heard in the debate on each report. The debate lost its dynamism because the shadow rapporteurs were not allowed to speak either. Even the rule that members who took part in the preparation of the report can present their comments in writing is proving problematic. The rule in force is that, during the course of one part-session, each member can react in writing only once.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The procedure for voting on own-initiative reports is also proving problematic. Under the new rule, amendments are not admissible for consideration in plenary. Only an alternative motion for a resolution may be tabled on behalf of a political group.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In practical terms, the shortcomings of our decision affected this very report, by Mrs Mikko, on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union. The relatively balanced report contained some points concerning particular Member States. I think that the contents of a report touching on such a sensitive theme should remain neutral. I did not intend to vote against the report but we did not get the chance to vote on the motion for a resolution tabled by our political group, the PPE-DE Group.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, pluralism in the media means diversity in the dissemination of information and the characteristic nature of broadcasters. Both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector. An ever-increasing concentration of ownership among media companies that are competing in this sector has led to a situation where information that is valuable from the social and cultural points of view is difficult to find in the maze of easily accessible and standardised news for everyone. It is difficult to predict what the worsening situation in this sector will lead to, not just for individual consumers, but also for society as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The rapporteur was right to emphasise the role of public sector broadcasters as the guardians of diversity, with a mission to broadcast high quality information. She is also right to propose a model where there are strong public sector media outside the competitive media market coexisting with private media companies that are motivated by profit. There can be no doubt about the importance of balance between these two pillars. The text of the report, as well as the intentions of the rapporteur, seem to be clear and transparent. The compromise reached during the discussions of the Committee on Culture is a good one.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, the legal status of the new methods of disseminating information, such as Internet blogs, or other user-generated sites, should be clearly delineated so that the people creating these forms should be aware of their rights and responsibilities and any possible sanctions. There will be more of this type of content. Basing these measures on a code of ethics is a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the resolution on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union that has been adopted, Members of the European Parliament, including myself, were right to speak in favour of guaranteeing freer access to diverse mass media as well as of freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should also, however, be pointed out that, as regards Internet blogs, the resolution differs significantly from the initial version of the report by Marianne Mikko and the Committee on Culture and Education. This report assumed there would be a clarification of the status of Internet blogs and user-generated sites such that they would be subject to regulations that are similar to those used for other publications. However, the resolution that was in fact adopted calls for an open discussion on the status of Internet blogs. For this reason I voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, the Internet and, specifically, Internet blogs, play an important role in promoting media pluralism and freedom of expression and, as such, should be free from any restrictions. Point 25 of the report in its previous version, if it were interpreted badly, constituted a threat to the freedom of expression of authors using this ever more popular medium. I would state in the strongest possible terms that any similar attempts at regulation and control in the future should be rejected by the European Parliament.</p>

More PE lessons and a balanced diet for children and young people would be among the first steps towards a healthier lifestyle, and nutritional science should be a compulsory subject in every European school.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for having agreed to address this question, which was tabled some four months ago. Let me remind you of the responsibilities of the EP Committee on Culture and Education, which, according to Annex VI, Section XV(2) of the Rules of Procedure, include ‘promotion of the system of European schools.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those schools give priority to educating the children of Community officials. Those children, classed as category I, make up around 70% of the total, pay no enrolment fees and the Commission contributes about 60% of the funding. Category II children, who make up 5%, and category III, who make up 25%, pay school fees of between EUR 4 000 and 16 000.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 14 existing schools teach nearly 21 000 pupils, from nursery school to baccalaureate level, out of a total of 100 million in the Union of 27, in 14 official languages with an identical curriculum in all the language sections. Compared to the situation of all the other school children in the European Union, these pupils are, therefore, highly privileged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2006 the Commission promised to reform the system – a laudable undertaking – with a view to establishing a European education system applicable to all types of school that wished to award the European baccalaureate, based on a common curriculum and, where possible, tuition in the mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The school in Parma, which is approved by the Board of Governors of the European Schools, will be the first school of its kind to award a European baccalaureate in June 2009. For its part, the Board of Governors of the European Schools undertook an in-depth assessment of the baccalaureate with a view to the ongoing reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A study commissioned by the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education, which will be available in October, shows that 94% of those who have passed the baccalaureate go on to higher education in the main European universities and that 62% of them study in a university outside their country of origin. There is, therefore, far greater mobility among these students than among others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That means we have at our disposal a European educational system that has proved its worth. In its resolutions of 2002 and 2005, the European Parliament advocated a profound reform of the schools system with a view to better governance and greater openness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given the successive enlargements of the EU and the increasing number of EU agencies and places of work of its staff, surely it is urgently necessary to reform the model of the European schools system and to begin to transpose it into the general educational systems?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is it not time to offer European citizens a well-tried, multilingual and flexible model of schooling that responds to their concern for mobility and to draw on the experience gained from the European schools? Of course I know what the reply will be: that is not within our powers. At least we should work on this because surely the perception of the European schools as elitist and the categorisation of pupils within those schools are incompatible with the objectives of a single market, mobility and greater social cohesion?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What progress has been made in the process of reform and greater openness to ensure that the European schools system can move towards a system of European schooling, while maintaining everything that has been achieved to date? What kind of Community funding systems could be envisaged to improve the running of the accredited schools? Parma may show us a way forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I would like to ask the Commissioner what progress has been made in the field of education for children with special needs?

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I thank the honourable Members for these questions and for this opportunity to discuss these issues in the European Parliament again.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commission, the reform of the European School system is a priority issue, and this is one of the most complicated items we are dealing with. The Commission has always strongly promoted the wider opening of the European School system, and progress has been achieved. Political agreement on this issue was marked at the ministerial meeting of November 2006, under the Dutch presidency of governors of European schools.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following formal approval by the Board of Governors in April 2008 of the concrete modalities to achieve this goal, any accredited school in the Member States can now teach the European curriculum and deliver the European Baccalaureate. It is up to the relevant authorities of the Member States to take initiatives to concretise this opening of the European School System in their national schools.</p>
      <p sl="en">The opening of the European School System is in line with the European Parliament’s wish to ensure that this would be possible both in places where an EU decentralised agency is located (so-called ‘type-II schools’), and in locations without a direct EU presence (so-called ‘type-III schools’).</p>
      <p sl="en">After almost 50 years of existence, the European Baccalaureate has indeed acquired a high intrinsic value. The Commission wants to maintain the high quality of this diploma.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Board of Governors of the European Schools approved in April 2008 a revision of the European Baccalaureate Agreement. Accredited schools can now deliver the European Baccalaureate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2007, Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education initiated a study to analyse the academic and professional careers of former pupils of the European Schools, as the honourable Member just mentioned. This study will show the specific benefits and possible difficulties experienced by former pupils of the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Secretary-General of the European Schools has also launched a study to make an external evaluation of the European Baccalaureate. I trust that the combined results of both studies will provide key elements to assess how to further improve the European School System in order to best adjust it to the changing needs of its pupils.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I can inform you that the European School System has considerably increased its efforts to integrate children with special educational needs (SEN). In the school year 2004/2005, the European Schools had 274 pupils with special educational needs. In the last school year, there were 411 such pupils enrolled in the European Schools. The SEN budget allocated for 2008 is EUR 3 123 000; in 2004, the SEN budget spent was a little over EUR 2 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission would like to thank the Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament for taking the initiative to set aside a reserve of EUR 200 000 for a pilot project for a SEN resource centre. This initiative gives the European School system the opportunity to better fulfil the needs of SEN children.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Board of Governors of the European Schools approved in July 2008 the proposal to use the European Parliament reserve of EUR 200 000 to make an evaluation of the existing SEN policy in the European Schools. This study will allow the European Schools to improve the quality of integration of SEN pupils.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission launched in July 2008 the financial procedure for the liberation of the European Parliament reserve of EUR 200 000. The transfer to the budgetary authorities is currently being initiated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Progress has been achieved, but it is crucial that the European Parliament supports the reform process initiated by the Commission in order to finalise this reform and put it fully into practice as soon as possible. Again, the crucial role must be played by Member States. I would like to underline that we have good contacts with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the Swedish presidency – which is not the presidency of the European Union but the presidency in the European Schools Board – will develop these initiatives. I would like to stress that the report drawn up by Mr Bösch, a Member of the European Parliament, has been very useful and he has been very instrumental in this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I myself will do everything to develop the system of European Schools, because we are experiencing great difficulties with a system that was designed in 1953, and we must therefore implement some serious changes to make this system flexible and work well.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I have asked to speak because I am concerned. We are talking about the European Schools today, and I am grateful to Mrs Hennicot for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to draw the attention of Commissioner Kallas to a specific aspect of the European Schools, namely religious education. During the course of last year a number of worrying reports reached me. As you all know, the Board of Governors of the European Schools ruled last year that a minimum of seven pupils of the same language was needed in order for a subject to be taught in the mother tongue. For general subjects such as geography and maths this is not a problem, but it is very different when it comes to religious education.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This raising of the minimum number means that there are now European Schools where pupils are no longer able to receive religious education in their own language. I am most concerned by this, especially at primary level. I think that religion, talking and learning about the standards and values we all prize so greatly in Europe, is extremely important. In religion, feelings are very important and as we all know, children are best able to express feelings and emotions in their mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I find it unacceptable that, depending on their language and nationality, some pupils can and others cannot receive religious education in their own language. So I ask the Commissioner to give thought to this and to set clear guidelines. All pupils, whether their mother tongue is English, German or Dutch, must have the same opportunities and the same quality of instruction.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Consideration should be given not only to the pupils but also to the position of teaching staff. The 'minimum of seven' rule means that every year the question arises of whether there are enough pupils, and teaching staff are not sure whether religious education will be provided in the following school year. This professional uncertainty has consequences when it comes to finding good teachers of religious education in all languages. I urge the Commission to emphasise the importance of religious education for European School parents and pupils and to hold out for the continuation of religious education in pupils' mother tongue at the European Schools.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, we have already noted here that the European Schools were, as official centres of instruction, established jointly by the governments of the Member States of the Union to provide multilingual and multicultural education primarily to the children of the staff of the institutions and that for many reasons they now need to be reformed, essentially in the light of new needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Union’s institutional development, enlargement, and the proliferation of agencies have led to changes in the profile of the pupils in the European Schools both as regards culture and language and in terms of numbers of pupils; applications to register have risen sharply.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, increased flexibility in employment contracts has led to new family and employment circumstances which affect social and family profiles and families’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Parliament has already noted in two resolutions, reform is necessary to modernise the schools so that they provide the required quality of service for which they were established, are accessible and overcome specific problems of access or segregation.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end I welcome the Commissioner’s announcement on the two studies now under way, we will see if they bear fruit.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, despite the increase in the number of Community languages and the increased complexities we face on many fronts, progress must be made in the process of reform, openness and improvement of these schools while ensuring that their qualifications are recognised in all Member States of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said that, I would like to put two specific questions to the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first relates to a number of complaints I have received from the parents of some pupils who have studied at the European School: it would appear that when they leave after taking the European Baccalaureate to continue their studies, one point is deducted from the average mark awarded; in other words they are penalised. I would like to know whether you are aware of this practice and the reason for it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second question relates to the children of Parliamentary assistants. I have also received complaints from assistants who have to send their children as category three entries if they want them to attend these schools; in other words, they have to pay school fees. I have visited the page which sets out all the information on how the Euroschools work; I have it here and shall read it in French because that is the language I found it in. It says, under category one:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘The children of staff in the service of the Community institutions and of the organisations listed below employed directly and continuously for a minimum period of one year.’</p>
      <p sl="es">A list of twelve points follows; point 4 says:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘Persons with a directly binding contract of employment, governed by private law, with the European institutions’.</p>
      <p sl="es">This, then, is the situation for people or the group of people who we might well think of as falling within category one. I would like to ask you why the children of Parliamentary assistants have to register under category three and pay school fees.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, firstly I would like to say on behalf of my group that it is true that the present system is fairly complicated. It needs to be simplified, and we know that matters of education basically fall within the competence of the Member States, though in the case of the European Schools it also lies with the Union. Wherever there are EU agencies there must also be European Schools. That is a basic principle, and we should also remember that our various strategies allow us to tell the citizens of Europe that education is always an investment in the future. It is on that basis that we should act in the case of the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would next like to raise a few points concerning education. The first concerns the extent to which it is free. I think that we in Europe should have a debate on making all education free, whatever school we are talking about. Every child and young person should have the chance of a good education and the opportunity to benefit from good teaching, and not having to pay is one guarantee of that. I think that if the Member States want this and if we really believe that education is an investment in the future, we can achieve this goal.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also important that teaching is done in the student’s mother tongue, as that is the basis of identity. Children and young people at European schools come from different cultures and different nations. It is important that they are taught in their own language, but is also vital to remember that we need special teaching facilities and also that students need to be taught cultural awareness, as they are often rootless, coming as they do from one country to another, which is a new and alien environment. For that reason we should also make sure of their overall personal development and growth as human beings. This is also the basis for European human rights policy and the European notion of humanity.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As for the special facilities I mentioned, class sizes are one thing that could be invested in. Class sizes must not be too large and every child should be given the chance to receive tailor-made options.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I will end by saying that the real educational standards amongst us Europeans will be measured in terms of how we treat those close to us who are worse off and how we look after children and young people, and the European schools are a shop window for the world. What are our actual standards of education and how do we look after our young people? Are we prepared to invest in them and their future? I hope that Europe can afford to do that and that it does actually invest in children and young people and in the European schools.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, 50 years of experience in European Schools that are faced with the specific problem of different languages, cultural diversity and migration makes one consider whether this experience should be used to make this school model more widely available. It is not just the children of officials working in European institutions who need to be taught foreign languages at the highest level, as well as integration with their peers from other European countries. It is not just they, who, because their parents have taken up posts abroad, need a particular approach to schooling.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are opposed to discrimination. Why then should children other than the children of these officials be excluded from those schools? I would also like to draw attention to the issue that is being considered by the Committee on Culture and Education, namely the need to reinstate the classics, Greek and Latin, in schools in Europe and also an emphasis on teaching Latin and Greek in the European Schools. I believe it is essential to give urgent consideration to the need to extend and reform European Schools as well as the principles according to which they operate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Culture, allow me to extend my warm welcome to the initiative of Erna Hennicot-Schoepges and Katerina Batzeli, members of the Committee on Culture, to address an oral question to the European Commission and have this debate on the progress of the reform of the European schools.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking of multilingualism and its importance, let me use this opportunity to raise a serious concern we have in Romania, where the recent initiative of the Ministry of Regional Development to complete the translation of the EU’s regional operational programme from Romanian into Hungarian met serious attacks from the Romanian Social Democratic Party run by several leaders of the former communist regime. Please note that this is happening in one of the 27 EU Member States in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, at a time when Commissioner Leonard Orban issued a policy document entitled, ‘Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment’. In the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a debate on the reform of the European Schools could not be of greater importance, as we live in a multicultural and multilingual Europe, where different cultures and languages coexist. We need to encourage and enable such cultural interaction for successful European integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, our European educational system needs to reflect this multicultural characteristic and allow a healthy and easy coexistence. European schools in particular were set up to meet these needs – to provide multicultural and multilingual education while also strengthening European identity. However, in an enlarged EU with greater citizen mobility and more agencies being created in different Member States, it has become a challenge to meet these needs. As the questions in today’s debate underline, there is a great need to focus on reforms, as it has proved to be more and more complex to provide multilingual and flexible education of high quality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to stress the fact that only by allowing students to express and practice their own cultural identity and use their own mother tongue throughout their education and formation can we allow them to evolve as true European citizens. If students studying in European Schools are not able first to develop their national identity through the use of their mother tongue and culture, I believe that they will not have a strong basis to build their European identity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention and I wish you good luck in the reform process of the European Schools.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a number of years ago two problems were identified with the European Schools. One was that they were lagging far behind in inclusiveness and integrated policies for special education needs (SEN) children. The other was that when parents would make an application to the school for a child with special needs, they had a practice of saying that they were not really able to meet their needs and the parents should go and find something else. This really was not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">In December 2007, Parliament set money aside in its budget to ‘contribute to the financing of first-class education for SEN children and to promote the concept of inclusive education and that this sum is to be released upon presentation of a proposal for the launch of a pilot project for the SEN resource centre comprising qualified personnel with relevant experience and appropriate teaching materials’. In the time I have I will not go through the negotiations, the back and forth, that have gone on about this pilot project. What has come about is that the pilot project has become several half-posts in psychology and some other resources, but it is not what I would see as a pilot project: actual classes, integrated classes throughout the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="de">I feel it is time for us to be very clear about the goal. The goal is inclusion and the goal is to integrate children in a way that is possible for them. There are now 411 SEN pupils in the European Schools in the SEN project. This is 2%, and yet disability in the general population is 17%. We are still not allowing enough children with special education needs into the schools, so we are still missing out on 15%. I cannot believe the figure for the population of people entitled to those schools is different from that in the general population.</p>
      <p sl="de">We certainly need to have a project and assess the situation but we could do that for ever – we have been looking at the situation for ever! It is time to move beyond the pilot schemes. It is time to make a real approach to children as standard practice in all the schools. We are a long way from doing that.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the other meaning of diversity. It is not just about languages and cultures: it is about peoples’ needs and their abilities and catering to the wide diversity of that as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while there is no doubt that the attempts to develop a European School have to be welcomed, we must not forget that the strategic objective is in some ways to make Europe into a guide from the scientific and social points of view, and into a model of cohabitation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In that sense, we then have to build on Europe’s cultural roots, for instance what Rome gave us in terms of law, what Greece gave us in terms of philosophy, and what Germany gave us in terms of music. However, it also has to be said that those languages considered to be dead, such as Latin and Greek, now need to be revived – and there is clear evidence of this – since they are languages that the most sophisticated American companies, such as General Motors or Yale University, consider fundamental for the modus operandi of entrepreneurs or, if you like, heads of family. It also has to be said that Christianity and the Christian values of our roots are fundamental elements in any genuine European School.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have presented you with a series of requests for more progress in European schools, which serve as examples for other schools in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Please answer my question about how much local legislation affects European schools. We have found that there are differences between the schools in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg. We have identified these differences specifically in the approach to children with learning difficulties. They have received different treatment depending on whether they are in Brussels or in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="el">While we are on the subject of pupils, why should they be separated into categories? Why do they have to make a careful choice of Baccalaureate courses before they have any lessons? Why do religious knowledge and classical languages have to be taught according to the number of pupils in the class? Why are children not taught the history of their country of origin? Why are children not taught in their national language?</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us turn now to staff: meritocratic selection in all the countries will provide a uniform standard among teachers’ associations. Do you check the selection process in all countries? There is a turnover of administrative staff, but there are people who remain head teachers for more than 20 years. Why is there no selection of head teachers?</p>
      <p sl="el">Flexibility, as you have said yourselves, will bring better results. The authorities of the Member States must take care to ensure that they do not have schools exclusively for ‘elite’ immigrants, but ones that serve as models for other immigrant schools.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I have come here not just as a Member of the European Parliament, but also as a person with practical experience of the European School, as I am the father of a child that attended the European School in Brussels for three years and who last year took the baccalaureate. From family experience, as well as from my occasional observations, for example, at parents’ evenings at this, which is one of the four European Schools in Brussels, I feel that I know what we are talking about today. I wanted to say just one thing: the number of these schools is increasing. When my son went to this school three years ago, there were three schools in Brussels and now there is a fourth one. The permitted number of pupils in classes in European Schools is 32.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth noting that in many European countries the permitted number of pupils in a class is considerably lower than in the European Schools. Our interest in this subject is clear: we have to take an interest in something that, as the European Union, we pay for. More than 50% of the budgets of these schools comes from European Union funds. The conclusion, Madam President, is this: it is sensible to open up these schools, but this should not be at the cost of teaching quality or an excessive number of children and young people in these schools.</p>

      <p sl="ro">European Schools are recognised in Europe as elite institutions that provide quality education to young people. In 1953, Jean Monnet said that the purpose of these schools was to bring together European children, irrespective of their nationality, and to instill in them the European spirit and sense of belonging, so that they may eventually create a united and prosperous Europe. The reform programme of these schools must take into account the following important issues. All of the 23 official languages of the European Union must exist within these schools, and children must be given the opportunity to speak their native language. Unfortunately, there are still some official EU languages which are not spoken in any of the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, one of the objectives of European Schools is to foster unity within groups of children, to bring them together and to facilitate the development of a spirit of tolerance and communication among them. Therefore, I believe that dividing them into three categories is not a sound measure. Those falling into the last category, 'others', as it is called, get the opportunity to attend such a school only if there are places left after the children of European officials have been admitted. This categorisation is discriminatory and I suggest that it should be removed from the statute of European Schools.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the concept of the ‘European School’ is become increasingly popular. This is a result of globalisation, which affects everything, including education. For this reason we have a guiding principle that we try to observe. This is where the problems begin. Finding an answer to the question ‘what should the school be like’ is very difficult. Should it be an elite school or universal, should it impose its own style and curriculum on all pupils, or should it be a school that moves in certain directions, but takes into account national and regional traditions; should it be a school where pupils are taught to appreciate and respect their own traditions, culture, history, religion and language, or should it teach openness to the cultures of other nations through multilingualism and appreciation of the whole world? There is one issue that, in principle, does not arouse any doubts. As there is a European Union, then diplomas issued by all the educational institutions of Member States should be recognised in the Schools.</p>

I visited the oldest European School in Brussels, which was established more than 50 years ago, and I met over 40 Romanian students who have the opportunity to study in their native language. It should be said that European Schools foster social inclusion, as students of different nationalities get to know and help one another.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to stress the effectiveness of the way in which the baccalaureate examination is organised, as it stimulates high performance and prepares students for their future lives as European citizens. I believe that the European School system should be extended to all the Member States, so as to become part of a common European policy in the field of education. Moreover, I move for the establishment and support of regional European Schools, which should take into account one basic principle of the European Union – regional policy in a mobile, knowledge-based Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In this last regard, I believe that European schools should be taken as the model for a world school, where an 'after-school learning' component should come into play.

The second observation that I want to make is that the construction of the European Union – what we are doing right now – also requires an adequate education. There are many technical aspects, like equipment, diplomas and so on, but the Commission, as executor, needs to uphold the idea of education based on more languages, on common principles and on respect for national values. This is very crucial. Education obviously requires the investment of money, but if you do not support making this investment, then you will have to accept ignorance, which I think will be more costly for us.</p>

There have been many changes in Europe over the past 50 years: a series of enlargements, an increase in the number of institutions and agencies and much more flexible employment contracts. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the European Schools system also needs change and reform.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There are a number of important areas that need changing. The issue that interests me the most is pupil selection, that is, the division into categories: one, two or three. After all, on the one hand the EU is trying to increase the mobility of European citizens in the labour market and to eliminate barriers and, on the other, it is blocking access to the Schools to children of potential employees of various institutions and companies from the whole of the EU. A solution needs to be found to the problem of overcrowding in certain schools. Measures also need to be taken as regards children with special needs.</p>

The growing number of student exchanges in European educational institutions and the globalisation of the world’s economy mean that the true value of the European Baccalaureate would justify making it more widespread. It should also be recognised by institutions of higher education in Member States and also in third countries. Unfortunately this cannot be accomplished without a substantial increase in funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present European Schools are perceived as elite schools that often exclude children whose parents are not EU officials. The exclusion of the greater part of society from the possibility of benefiting from European Schools is contrary to the objective of increasing the mobility of European citizens in our labour market. Member States themselves often try to create a new education system that will prepare young people better for the challenges associated with globalisation and a flexible labour market, while the system of European Schools and the European Baccalaureate have already long been in existence and, what is most important, have had excellent results, so we should duplicate them as much as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I rise not merely as a Member of this House but also as a former schoolmaster. I wonder whether I might ask Commissioner Kallas, at his next meeting with the Council of Ministers, to have a particular word with the British Minister of Education to see whether or not it is possible that he might learn some of the lessons of the successes of the European School model. Perhaps in particular he might consider reversing the disastrous decision of the British Government to make the teaching of languages voluntary, in other words dropping European languages from the British curriculum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, you might just remind him that Europe was divided for half a century, but that it has now been reunited for 20 years. Perhaps he might consider suggesting to his curriculum advisers that they remind the next generation of the history and the culture of Central and Eastern Europe, in which Britain traditionally was very much involved and did actually seek to support.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the stress should not just be on the criticism, from various sides, of the inadequacies of the current model of governance. I believe that we all have a duty to understand, after this debate, what is at stake, i.e. the model that the European Schools can represent for the European area of education; and since we want to overcome the challenge of the European area of education and are keen in this respect for good practices to win out, it is absurd and contradictory that we are sticking to a level and a model of governance unable to meet the challenges which we face. In my view, today’s debate offers the Commission more than enough of a spur to realise that we have to undertake a radical overhaul of our schools.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to put two further questions to the Commissioner, who gave a figure but it is the current figure. Commissioner, are there also to be increases in appropriations for the next financial perspective; is there a system of funding in place that will ensure that these schools can continue to function? Apparently at this very moment they are short of 40 English teachers, given the financial problems experienced by Her Majesty’s Government. May I ask you what solution can be envisaged in view of that situation? Secondly, the schools themselves would like more autonomy. Are you in favour of greater autonomy or would you prefer to keep to the present system, which is cumbersome and often ill-suited to local situations?</p>

    <intervention id="4-232" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, several very serious and important issues have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all I would like to remind you that the European Schools system is a completely independent body. It is based not on the Treaty of 1958 but on the Statute of 1953, it has its own Board, its own Statute, and all rules are adopted by this Board. The Commission is only one voice on the Board.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the content of the education, this is fully the responsibility of the Board, and all this, including the different proportions between the language sections, and the curriculum, is totally in the hands of the Board of Governors of the European Schools. So the Commission has not very much to say.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to financing, this is the second thing I would like to say in reply to one important question. The infrastructure is provided by the host countries. So the schools are built by Belgium, Germany, France etc. This gives us the full picture of the limits we have in developing the infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">What about the content of education? The honourable Member mentioned in her introductory remarks that the quality of the education is high – and it is high. This is one of the main priorities of the European Commission, to give every possible support so that this quality will be high. This will really be a benchmark for European educational systems, that European Schools give pupils an education which is highly appreciated everywhere. So I do not have any information that pupils with a European School education have any specific difficulties in getting to university after school if they so wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning teachers, they count as part of the infrastructure, so teachers are also provided by Member States. English teachers, for example, are provided by the United Kingdom; in other words, the burden for bigger languages is correspondingly much higher. We, the Commission – or the European budget – pay the operational costs for this. This gives us a combination that results in a rather cumbersome system, and one objective is therefore to reform the system and to bring more clarity to responsibility and financing. You can also see the problems with Belgium, where, it has been said, one of the four schools is still a temporary school. The construction of the fourth school has been postponed and postponed, and we are in intensive discussions with the Belgian Government about this.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the openness of European schools, in our view the key issue is the European Baccalaureate, and the certification of schools which want to award the European Baccalaureate. We promote this idea, which has basically been adopted by the Board of Governors, so the basic rules exist. Now the question is how to put this into practice in the Member States. Again, the leading role lies with the Member States. So this will to some extent settle the problem of different pupils.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, as I said, I am meeting Parliament and I hear your observations that category III is something which must be excluded, but I also regularly meet our staff – it is the same size, comprising hundreds of people – and they of course have a clear demand, namely that education for their children must be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there is a requirement – and this is emphasised very strongly in the Treaty, in the Staff Regulations, in the regulation – to provide places in the schools and then, of course, the question arises who will distribute these other places which are to remain free and definitely in Brussels? This is more and more difficult. This is for me a very complicated question. At the beginning of this Commission, we insisted on behalf of our staff that there must be more clarity, and so the Central Enrolment Authority has been established by the Board of Governors to settle these questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is the overall picture, and I must just repeat that the Commission’s attitude is that we must bring clarity to the financial issues and clearly share the burden, have clear responsibilities, clear obligations, and then we can also find better solutions to the infrastructure questions, but we cannot have any kind of reduction in the quality of education.</p>
      <p sl="en">About some specific questions, one honourable Member raised the question about disabled students. You said that there are many more of them but I do not know that anybody has been rejected when parents have asked for special treatment: it has always been provided. So, if you have facts that there are some hidden pupils with disabilities, please provide these facts and we will deal with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, about parliamentary assistants, you know that at present parliamentary assistants are not covered by the Staff Regulations, they are a kind of special staff members in Parliament, but you know also that negotiations are ongoing to settle this and to have more precise rules, and then we can also consider what to do about access to the European Schools for the children of parliamentary assistants.</p>
      <p sl="en">So these are more or less the questions which were raised, and of course all these questions – religious education, languages – are clearly in the hands of the Board of Governors, and the Commission is just one voice on that Board. The Board of Governors is dealing with these issues very seriously. They have held long discussions about this, and I can assure you that the Secretariat-General of the European Schools is very attentive to all needs of the different languages and different religious aspects. So this is their responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just one thing more: if Parliament can draw Member States’ attention, and especially if all Members of the European Parliament who have their own connections in their home countries can encourage the Member States’ Ministers of Education, to promote this idea of the European Baccalaureate because this is their choice. We now have rules on how to go ahead with the European Baccalaureate. Now it is up to the national ministries to find interested schools. I know that there are a lot of interested schools, but the national authorities in many countries have not shown enough enthusiasm about this project, which can be a step forward and which can really then be a positive mark for the European Baccalaureate, so we can have European Schools not only in Brussels but everywhere – in new Member States and old Member States. This is a symbol of Europe. The Baccalaureate and European education is one element in our architecture.</p>

      <p sl="it">I agree with the various solutions proposed for the reform of the European Schools: my privileged role as the Committee on Development’s rapporteur on the Erasmus Community action programme leads me strongly to support the need for a multilingual and flexible European Schools model in which mother-tongue teaching is maintained (and is taught by teachers who are native speakers) but which is, at the same time, the same for all without class distinctions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Baccalaureate will be the first instrument, followed by the opportunities offered by Erasmus, to guarantee real mobility for students, in Europe and then throughout the world. Tutoring obviously has an important role to play in the social, cultural and linguistic integration of incoming students and the achievement of excellent linguistic skills needs to be encouraged, with support from intensive courses (as has been underscored from 2001 to today by the Day of European Languages held every 26 September).</p>
      <p sl="it">I consider that cooperation between the current European Schools and regional (primary and secondary) schools is a sine qua non for the development of a new European Schools system, but I cannot hide my concern for the future of Italian regional schools which – as a result of the new ‘Gelmini’ reform – could well disappear in some smaller, geographically disadvantaged, communities.</p>

      <p sl="en">The processes undertaken by the European Union in the last few decades and the ever-evolving educational system have meant that a new perspective on the role and importance of the European Schools has to be taken into consideration. Given the latest enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States and with the increase in EU staff that implies, the significance of a well-reformed European School has become an issue of high priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to improve future expectations from the European Schools, we must approach the sensitive issues challenging the current system and identify the problems in order to design the foreseeable changes. Thus there is great demand for a newly drawn-up and comprehensive reform of the European Schools, so as to make them more competitive and transparent on a European level and to design their full-weight purpose in a more up-to-date way.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implementation of the principle of non-discrimination while granting fundamental freedoms to the pupils must be at the core of the new system in order to make it fully operational and in their own benefit. Nevertheless, the financing of the European Schools must be also reevaluated by taking into account indiscriminating measures for the pupils with regard to their division into categories.</p>
