      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the fact that this Parliament is focusing on the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the current difficult economic climate, it is all the more important that SMEs, which are the principal contributors to our economies, are provided with a climate in which they can flourish and grow.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have chosen to focus this debate on two specific issues: that of access by SMEs to Structural Funds and that of the definition of SMEs. Both of these have been the subject recently of oral questions to the Commission. In fact, it is correct to address the Commission on both these issues and I am sure that the Commissioner will be able to respond in more detail to the particular points which I know are of concern to this Parliament, to the Commission and, of course, to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the Presidency is concerned, I would like to share with you a number of points which are important to the Council. Firstly, SMEs are the backbone of our economy. They are the drivers of wealth creation and of our ability to adjust flexibly to changes in demand, and are a major source of employment. That is why SMEs have been at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. At a time when more than 25 million people are unemployed, we need the SMEs to generate jobs, especially for young people.</p>
      <p sl="en">SMEs draw valuable support from the Structural Funds. Indeed, over the period 2007 to 2014, SMEs will have benefited from these funds to a total of EUR 70 billion. This financial support helps strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the credit crunch, ensuring that SMEs have access to adequate finance has become even more important. For this reason, a number of schemes guaranteeing loans to SMEs have been extended, and there are several new initiatives designed to provide SMEs with interest-rate subsidies and to increase the credit ring-fenced for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Financial instruments constitute a rapidly growing and effective form of support for SMEs from the Structural Funds. They complement grant financing and are more sustainable because the money can be recycled and used again in the future. Venture capital and loan funds are also indispensable for SMEs. In addition, SMEs benefit from financing through the European Investment Bank, which provides loans at advantageous rates. These constitute valuable financing mechanisms offering a flexible approach that is an alternative to either grants or loans from commercial banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">A further valuable source of funding comes from the various initiatives set up jointly by the Commission and the EIB. The financial instruments known as JEREMIE, JESSICA and JASMINE are designed to improve SMEs’ access to finance by providing equity, loans and guarantees.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the matter of the definition of SMEs, I am aware that the Commission is preparing a survey to assess Member States’ opinions on the current definition and whether it could be beneficial to change it. In the Council, we have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this issue and we are looking forward to receiving the Commission’s survey. That said, it is important to note that the current definition means that 95% of all companies in Europe are SMEs. It therefore seems natural that we have a thorough discussion and a proper analysis on a possible change of the definition, and we also look forward to hearing the opinion of Parliament and discussing this issue with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the focus of your interest this morning is the issue of access to finance by SMEs – and rightly so, given the current economic climate. I would like to close by emphasising that, while access to finance is, of course, extremely important, SMEs also need a favourable business environment in which to be able to develop. The Small Business Act, adopted in 2008, has been key in helping SMEs, through the creation of a comprehensive policy framework. In conjunction with this, many Member States have taken steps to help SMEs – for example, through the establishment of ‘one-stop shops’ for people starting up businesses – but we must all remain particularly vigilant so that we continue to provide SMEs with a proper environment in which to grow, and so that we simplify the business environment and reduce the burden of red tape on all businesses.</p>

    <intervention id="2-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Johannes Hahn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, honourable Members, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European economy. We have a total of around 23 million SMEs in Europe, which amounts to 99.8% of European companies. Therefore, the growth and future competitiveness of Europe depend on the competitiveness of our SMEs. The crisis has hit SMEs in the same way as all other businesses. It is generally SMEs which now have greater difficulty in obtaining loans and outside capital. For this reason, there is a public responsibility to help SMEs, so that they do not become victims of credit squeezes and are able to make full use of their potential for innovation. This is why the European Commission has repeatedly taken measures over recent years to give SMEs better access to capital. By adapting existing programmes in 2010 and 2011, the Commission has succeeded in increasing the funding available for financial instruments, such as loans and guarantees, to more than EUR 8.1 billion. This was the situation at the end of 2010. The money has been used to finance a total of 300 different instruments in the Member States and more than 90 000 direct jobs have been created as a result.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament once again for its rapid, committed and ongoing support for the amendments to our regulations. The amendments have been needed over the years to respond to precisely these challenges. For example, working capital has been designated as eligible for subsidies in the context of revolving funds and a significant contribution has also been made to the process of overcoming the crisis, particularly in certain Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">In January this year, the Commission took a further step, together with the Member States, and adapted the programmes in such a way that the funding still available could be used specifically to create new jobs. Its initiative also included measures to combat youth unemployment. This reallocation is primarily intended to benefit SMEs, in as far as the funds available still allow for this, because it is SMEs that can create lasting jobs in Europe. I would like to remind everyone that there are around 24 million unemployed people in Europe and 23 million SMEs. In simple terms, if every SME hired one unemployed person, the problem would almost be solved.</p>
      <p sl="de">This initiative will result in between EUR 5 billion and EUR 8 billion being reallocated, as things stand today. During the next programming period, the Commission has put a clear emphasis on ensuring that SMEs benefit from the Structural Funds. A total of 80% of the money from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in more developed regions and 50% in less developed regions will be spent on these priorities, including innovation in SMEs, renewable energies and energy efficiency. It is important to remember that, in absolute figures, the 50% in the less developed regions amounts to more than the 80% in the more developed regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">This initiative clearly focuses on the priorities and also sends out a strong signal that we want to improve the competitiveness of SMEs. To achieve this, we must, of course, also work together to make it easier in administrative terms for SMEs to access money from the Structural Funds. I would therefore like to thank the European Parliament for the many proposals it has submitted with the aim of simplifying the administrative processes even further. At the same time, I would like to mention that a significant proportion of the administrative challenges are at national and regional level. For example, we will be making the implementation of the Small Business Act subject to ex ante conditionalities, or at least that is what we have proposed. We need joint efforts at European level and by the Member States on behalf of our SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one final point that has already been mentioned. The definition of the term SME is a frequent topic for discussion. You will be aware that the European Commission regularly reviews this definition and that another independent evaluation is currently under way which will also take into consideration the number of employees and the turnover limits. We are expecting to receive the results of these investigations in the early autumn of 2012. The results will, of course, be discussed openly and on a broad basis. At the moment, I cannot say whether this will lead to a change in the current definition.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, SMEs form the backbone of the European economy. Over recent weeks and months, many discussions have taken place on the subject of growth and measures to stimulate growth. I would like to make it clear that anyone who wants to take lasting steps to promote growth must begin by increasing the competitiveness of SMEs. The Commission at least is prepared to do this.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the EU’s programmes need to be more user-friendly. I regret to say that often, they are written by officials for officials, and not for entrepreneurs. There are far too many entrepreneurs giving up before they even get started. We all know that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that are creating the jobs, and that is why we must make the application procedures more accessible. We have to get rid of this red tape. I also think that we can, in fact, improve the way we link access to financing for enterprises with the challenges that Europe is facing. After all, we have work to do in respect of energy efficiency. Might it perhaps be an idea to create a link between the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises and some of this work by taking money from the Structural Funds and giving it to small and medium-sized enterprises? This could create lots of jobs for those termed ‘blue-collar workers’; in other words, ordinary people in boiler suits, craftsmen, who could be employed to provide insulation, install new windows, and so on. This would allow us to solve both climate problems and employment problems, while at the same time allowing the resources in the funds to be used for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is, after all, precisely these companies that are creating jobs.</p>
      <p sl="da">Where the SME definition is concerned, I think we should be cautious about shifting the current definition too far. I do not think it should be expanded under any circumstances because, as the definition stands at present, it already covers more than 99% of all enterprises.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="1854" name="Constanze Angela Krehl" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has so often been said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European Union’s economy and this is indeed the case. We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="96873" name="Jürgen Creutzmann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, one of the most serious problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is access to finance. The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a key role in the economies of many countries; countries that are suffering enormously from the economic and financial crisis. The huge role of SMEs in job creation is even more important for sectors of the population such as women, immigrants or the young. Young people currently account for 40% or almost 50% of unemployment in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The high unemployment rates demand of the political class – of all of us – that we make this economic sector more competitive in Europe. There have been very indebted SMEs in Europe in recent years. In fact, we believe that 85% of the jobs created in the European Union were created by SMEs, especially new companies. However, we believe there are major administrative burdens. There is therefore a need to provide for programmes specifically intended to boost the SME sector in the upcoming Cohesion Fund reform. We need to use innovative measures, facilities and new technologies to streamline the mechanisms for coordinating the various administrations; to show the potential of cross-border companies; to risk opening up the market; and to help SMEs to combat the crisis and the lack of jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased that this item and our question are on the agenda for debate today, but I am not so happy with the replies that are forthcoming. It is a very lonely matter for small businesses to start and to grow – and even to survive – and we need to give them all the assistance we can that is reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concerns of small businesses are fairly consistent over the years. First of all, they need access to information. They need assistance in finding out where to get help. Secondly, they need assistance to gain access to finance. It is particularly difficult for people to raise small loans; banks hate lending small amounts of money to people and small enterprises; they like big amounts which they can manage and charge good fees on. That is a big challenge. But we can do something about the burden of administration, of red tape. Complying with regulations is more difficult for small businesses than it is for larger firms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to close by saying that, for the longer term, I hope the Commission will take on board the last point in our question about allocating unspent balances in other budget lines to research and development. That is the way to help jobs and wealth creation for the future.</p>

    <intervention id="2-016-000" speaker_id="99416" name="Nikolaos Salavrakos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, small and medium-sized enterprises are the cornerstone of the European economy and perhaps the most important vehicle for stimulating growth and creating jobs under the current circumstances in the European Union. However, this sector is the most vulnerable to the impact of the economic crisis. Profit margins of small and medium-sized enterprises in Greece have been eroded by as much as 60%, which is the highest in Europe, followed by Spain with 55%. This compares with Germany, where the profit margins of small and medium-sized enterprises have soared to 21%. My country, Greece, has witnessed the biggest deterioration in the sector and access for small and medium-sized enterprises to bank loans is now non-existent. Many companies are closing, making the situation in the entrepreneurship and labour sectors even worse. However, according to recent lending surveys by the European Central Bank, banks have increased the criteria for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission therefore needs to consider and propose measures to facilitate the take-up of funds, especially by countries which are unable to raise their share of cofinancing due to strict austerity measures. The Commission needs to foster cooperation and synergisms between the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank in order to identify financing instruments that will generate exponential results. The most profitable sectors of each economy must be identified and proper strategic planning is needed.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017-000" speaker_id="111589" name="Inês Cristina Zuber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, much can be said about the need to develop the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector and make it grow. Much can be said about how crucial SMEs are to helping economic growth and job creation. Whatever might be said, what is certain is that implementing so-called austerity measures leads daily to the strangulation, asphyxiation and destruction of thousands of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Until we break with and reverse the path of recessive policies, it will be impossible to promote economic growth and job creation. The statements being made in political circles – from the right to the centre-left – of the intention to make austerity incompatible with growth are nothing short of illusory; an attempt to push blindly ahead, and to use fine but ineffective words to hide the tragic and material consequences of austerity policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The very measures imposed by the troika in Portugal provide a good example of this social tragedy. Since these measures were implemented in Portugal one year ago, 203 500 jobs have been destroyed, equating to 558 jobs per day. Many of these jobs have been lost from SMEs because the companies in question went out of business, but it could not have been any other way; and that is so logical that a child could understand it. Wage and pension cuts and increased indirect taxation on the products sold by small and medium-sized enterprises lead to reduced consumption and then to SMEs going out of business.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is the same European Commission that fixes – along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank – the measures ravaging Portuguese SMEs that is now telling us about the need to support SMEs. It is true that it is important to support SME creation, but it would also now be logical to stop applying political measures that are condemning existing SMEs to go out of business as we speak.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Support for SMEs should involve State aid, made available by reversing the process of monopolisation of the economy, which has been exacerbated by the creation of the single market and which has benefited big capital within the Member States, as well as multinationals. There is a need to regulate key factors of production, such as energy or banking, so that SMEs will not, as customers, be subjected to unbearable monopolistic prices, such as the interest rates that they have to pay to access credit. EU funding must be made more accessible to SMEs, by cutting red tape and streamlining processes, by ensuring timely payment, and by positively discriminating in favour of areas and sectors facing particular difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have heard a lot of fine words today about small businesses being the backbone of society and our economy, etc., etc., but what about the reality? I am reminded that President De Gaulle scoffed at the English and called us a nation of shopkeepers. But, Mr President, it is our small businesses and our shopkeepers that employ the vast majority of the workforce in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training.</p>
      <p sl="en">Take the European Globalisation Fund: every other country in the EU has had access to this fund except the United Kingdom. This is pertinent in Ryton, near Coventry, where Peugeot closed down in 2005. It also closed plant in France, but the French got training and the people of Coventry did not. Then there are these ‘JEREMIE’ funds, providing funding for small businesses around Europe, including in the south of France – a country that is a member of the G8. Is there any in the UK? No, there is not. Absolutely disgraceful!</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, we are the second largest contributor to the European Union; we need to cut out the middle man, fund our own small businesses and leave the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I have a question for Mr Hahn. What is the situation with regard to the research infrastructure? What are the plans in the field of research for making opportunities available to SMEs?</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question is for Mr Wammen. We have heard from President Hollande that we urgently need a strategy for growth. What specific impact will this have on the 2013 budget? What items are you planning to include in the 2013 budget in order to put a concrete growth strategy in place? What is being done in the multiannual framework programme for the period up to 2020? What types of growth infrastructures are you planning in this area? What programmes do you want to see here and, most importantly, what funding will be available for them?</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is that we need to make sure that young entrepreneurs have the opportunity to gain experience in other countries in the European Union, but also outside the European Union. We have the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme. Will there be a significant increase in this area to enable us to bring young entrepreneurs together with their suppliers and their markets?</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, in the context of the definition, we need to think about the mid-caps, the international companies with a high volume of exports, and about whether they could also receive support from the globalisation fund.</p>

    <intervention id="2-020-000" speaker_id="28340" name="Patrizia Toia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, development is not a luxury but a duty. Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity.</p>
      <p sl="it">As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, gaining access to funding, which is so essential to their growth and development, continues, nonetheless, to be one of the major challenges facing SMEs, both at European and national level, with them being one of the sectors hit hardest by the current economic crisis. Participating in projects financed by Structural Funds now offers a real chance for survival. However, European institutions, and especially national governments, retain the vital role of supporting SMEs by means of economic measures which will enable them to gain access to cash and investments so that they can complete the projects which are in progress.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The effectiveness and efficiency of the funds allocated to the financial instruments for SMEs have been diminished due to a regulatory framework that is inadequate and far too complicated for the different types of financial instruments used. The direct consequence of this is to discourage rather than encourage potential beneficiaries. In order to enable high-quality strategic projects to develop and ensure the biggest possible absorption of the Structural Funds earmarked for this sector, the private sector, immediate, specific measures need to be taken not only to simplify the rules of operation, but also to provide the necessary technical assistance in terms of accessing the funds, implementing the projects and improving entrepreneurial skills.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Members who initiated this debate raised the issue in their ninth question of whether it would be a good idea to review the cofinancing requirements for EU programmes aimed at SMEs. I think this is a question that we should be asking. However, we must make the context clear and if we weaken or water down the definition of SMEs by including mid-caps, there will be less money available to distribute to the SMEs in an area where the funding was already insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, if we reduce the cofinancing requirements, overall, fewer SMEs will have to share the available funding. This means that the only option available to us is to increase the money, if we are prepared to do so. Therefore, the conclusion that we must draw from this discussion is that we cannot simply stand by and watch while less money is spent on SMEs in Horizon 2020 and the Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) than in …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, small and medium-sized businesses face many problems, and red tape is a big one. Micro-businesses should be exempted from large swathes of EU legislation and, when they are included, they should have a light-touch regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Access to funding is also a problem. Some suggest increasing allocations of EU budgets for SMEs, but here again, bureaucracy can be overwhelming. I have had many complaints from small businesses that have taken part in EU projects and have then waited for months or years for payment, and sometimes the money has never arrived. If a company is being contracted to carry out work and the work has been delivered, then it should be paid on time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission claims the Late Payment Directive will solve this problem but, like much EU law, it has had unintended consequences. I know of one sector where large companies have simply cut out buying from smaller ones. We need to stop just talking about SMEs, and take some action. In calling for the debate today, we asked nine specific questions and, Commissioner, I look forward to getting nine specific answers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Parliament is closely watching how the European Commission intends to remove the barriers faced by small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite the fact that in the current programming period, the allocation of resources in my country is relatively high, representatives of small firms are, however, pointing out that interest in these funds and demand for them is higher than the amount available.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to point out that a specific feature of the Polish SME sector is that it is dominated by very small firms – micro-entities. These comprise as many as 96% of all SMEs, of which over two-thirds involve self-employment – the people who run these firms are self-employed. So it is necessary to remove numerous barriers, including most of all the growing bureaucracy. Furthermore, at a time of deepening recession, a difficulty is presented by the fact that there is a general deficit of the own resources necessary in the EU system of cofinancing. It is also necessary to give attention to the waiting period for these resources, which is too long, as well as to the fact that advance payments are not made for these projects. The European Parliament should therefore simplify and improve procedures when it starts work on drafting new rules in 2013.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I have been going round my country, Bulgaria, during the last few months and have met quite a few representatives, mainly of small businesses. I have heard the same message from all of them: ‘We are being choked! Stop looking at the big companies and banks because we are being choked the most by the crisis, compared to all the rest!’ I also saw the production methods they use and, unfortunately, many of these companies are using the same technology as they were 20 years ago when they started their business.</p>
      <p sl="bg">When I asked them: ‘Well, why do you not bid for projects, why do you not modernise your technology?’, I received the same answer everywhere: this administration does not make it worth the effort to try to bid for a project, because they will probably not get it. Even corruption does not operate in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises because the officials running projects want large projects because large projects lead to large bribes.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I will begin on a somewhat more positive note than the funereal lamentations I heard this morning. In preparation for this debate, I visited one of those projects in which European money from the Structural Funds is being used to preserve industrial heritage and provide the opportunity to start up new businesses. In the space of two years, 400 jobs have been directly created, and around a thousand jobs have been brought about. The idea, then, is to use existing instruments, along with the investment of private capital, to bring local and regional authorities together.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have three questions about this for the Commissioner and the Minister.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, is it not possible for the financial framework for 2014-2020, which we are now discussing, and which frees up some new money again, so-called revolving funds, to be moved up the agenda? We have a Council, an informal Council, coming up. There is a summit coming up. Should this not be used as precisely the opportunity to send a political signal? By which I mean a signal with which we provide clarity about heading 1 of the multiannual financial framework. Then, money will be released again.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second question is, would it not be possible for you to ask each individual Member State to produce a real action plan for SMEs? Why is that necessary, you may ask. The reason is that a number of Member States are still stuck in a bureaucratic muddle in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My final point is that there are improvements we can make, we can cut red tape. By way of example, pre-financing for projects is still a major problem. The banks are not providing it, and companies do not have the money. We need to put a stop to this and create momentum. Could I have an answer to these three questions please?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are all saying that small and medium-sized enterprises need access to finance, need less red tape and need better access to markets. The European Union is doing lots on that, but there are still plenty of things that could be done in addition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, on access to finance, we definitely need to increase possibilities for advance payments, especially for micro and small companies. It is very difficult for them to go for cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the next multiannual financial framework (MMF), we need to look at things again. I am the rapporteur on the next MFF. There is a proportionate decrease in cohesion funding and a decrease in the access of SMEs to financing. Yes, there is increased access to financing for cutting-edge high technologies, but how many small and medium-sized enterprises maintain cutting-edge technologies? All in all, this will lead to a decrease in financing for SMEs under the next MFF.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, again on cofinancing, we have been considering something the President of the Commission suggested, which is to use funds not spent by the end of the current framework period not only to stimulate employment, but also to stimulate SMEs. As regards red tape, one should not only make available and promote best practices, but also penalise bad practices, because it is absolutely inadmissible that in some Member States, funds earmarked for small and medium-sized enterprises remain unspent, for whatever reason – be this administrative or otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, on enabling access to markets, this is very important in terms of enlarging the digital market – there are plenty of things to be done and we are moving forward with the digital agenda – and also in terms of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not have appropriate access to European markets at the moment.</p>

We need to go a step further now and help SMEs by mainstreaming revolving funds, loan guarantees and similar systems so that they are part of cohesion policy instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no one simple answer to the problem of SMEs’ lack of access to credit. My colleague, Sharon Bowles, has been doing her best through amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive, but SMEs need other avenues to finance in addition to bank lending.</p>
      <p sl="en">Crucially, along with the financial instrument itself, there must be proportionate corporate auditing and reporting standards, because there is no point in making finance theoretically available to SMEs if there is so much red tape that in practice, no small business has time to put in an application. Structural Fund financing needs to be fully accessible to even the smallest small business.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, small and medium-sized enterprises have indeed been the hardest hit by the present crisis. A large percentage of the unemployed used to work in such enterprises; at the same time, owners of such enterprises lose their job, which is often overlooked in the unemployment rates. Today, we have a dual problem, because small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to access either loans or financing under European programmes. It is a fact that, currently, 80% of loan applications by small and medium-sized enterprises are turned down in Greece. This means that there is no money either to take action or to import raw materials or products and they end up going under. On the other hand, the current terms of access to European financing do not allow small and medium-sized enterprises to take action, because they need to spend the capital first, because VAT is not eligible and because, in the end, they have to wait a long time to get back the money they have spent. That is impossible if they go under. We therefore need to change, so that we can put what the Commissioner said into practice. Every small and medium-sized enterprise needs to take on one young person and we need to combine financing for small and medium-sized enterprises with financing to address youth unemployment, so that these targets can be attained.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up more than 90% of the companies in the EU and provide more than 80% of the jobs. They are the backbone of our economy and access to sufficient capital has been a particular problem for them during the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">A recent study carried out by the European Parliament shows that the existing funding instruments are not adequately targeted. The reason for this is that a proper distinction is not being made between the different types of SME. They are not a homogeneous group, either in terms of the number of people they employ or of their turnover. One consideration is the company’s current phase of development. A young and innovative entrepreneur who is just building up his business has different requirements from a traditional family company.</p>
      <p sl="de">The majority of problems are caused by high administration costs and complex accounting requirements. We need to start taking action in this area to ensure that SMEs, which are the engine of our economy, can grow accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, small and medium-sized enterprises are the basis of modern economies and are an effective tool in the fight against unemployment and the financial crisis. They represent the greatest source of new jobs, and it is to SMEs that the economy owes its growth.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to European statistics for 2005-2010, 85% of new jobs were created in SMEs. In Europe, 99% of firms are SMEs employing up to a dozen or so people. In this context, it is worrying to see the position of the Commission, which is proposing a change in the definition of SMEs by extending it to include firms with larger numbers of employees. Does this mean, Commissioner Hahn, that SMEs are going to have to compete for support with firms which have several hundred employees and which have well-prepared staff whose only role is to secure EU funding? Will this not create difficulties in obtaining support for scientific research and innovations in the framework programme, where awards are made on a top-down basis?</p>
      <p sl="pl">You said, Commissioner Hahn, that SMEs are the backbone of the European economy. We all know that we should take particular care of our spine. Without increased access to EU funds, without reducing administration and without simplifying the process of applying for funds, which is complicated and too protracted, the Commission, Commissioner Hahn, will be one of the many voices in the European Parliament which have pointed out the problem and understood the reasons for its existence, but which, unfortunately, have not resolved it.</p>

    <intervention id="2-032-000" speaker_id="97125" name="Frédéric Daerden" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is obvious that, in the current crisis, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is crucial for restarting the economy and for combating unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. That is why I think, like many of my fellow Members, that their access to Structural Funds should be simplified and increased, but also promoted through training and support related to the procedures that are inherent to accessing these funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also recognise that the legal framework in which they are developing must be adapted to the resources they have available to them in order to face up to their obligations, and that is where the definition of SMEs becomes important, as this will determine the law applicable to a company. The current definition would cover more that 67% of workers in the EU. It is therefore an important sector of our economy and of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As is often the case in our legislative decisions, we need to find a balance. As for SMEs, their legal framework should combine both the objective of effectiveness, allowing for their development, and the objective of adequate protection of workers’ rights and the general interest. However, an unbalanced reduction of SMEs’ administrative burdens could entail a risk, for example, in terms of health and safety at work – workers cannot be subjected to different risks, particularly with regard to measures aimed at improving workers’ health and safety in the workplace; health and safety in the workplace cannot be considered an administrative burden – or even in terms of reducing accounting and financial obligations for some SMEs, which is particularly worrying for workers’ representatives, and rightly so in my view. How can we involve workers in company decision-making processes if they do not have the information based on which decisions about restructuring, for example, are made? A minimum level of transparency for workers and third parties is needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in the hunt for excessive administrative burdens on SMEs, let us not lose sight of the objective of these burdens and let us not discriminate against the workers in these companies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are talking today about the Structural Funds, the growth programme for the European Union, particularly in the poorer regions. We do not need to invent any new growth funds, which is what the left-wing governments in Europe are currently calling for. However, we do need to ensure that the EUR 350 billion currently being proposed is carefully targeted and quickly reaches the people in the regions who need it. During this process, we can learn from the practical implementation of European structural policy, in particular, where competitive procedures were used and where companies had to compete for EU money. In the competitiveness regions, we have introduced more medium-sized companies to European programmes than ever before. One example is the field of nanotechnology, where some regions have succeeded in combining cutting-edge European research and start-up companies. Competitions have also been successfully held in areas such as energy efficiency and sustainable production processes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Competitive procedures are efficient and they represent the opposite of the scattergun approach. Therefore, we must incorporate this option in the Structural Funds regulations, as has already been done in the Connecting Europe Facility in the field of infrastructure. In the case of small companies, European stimuli are often a decisive factor for start-ups and for international business relationships. Providing this funding in the context of a competition is very similar to the way in which the market economy works and this is known to be very efficient.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, we have a long tradition in this House of discussing subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). What we have heard this morning does not differ significantly from what has been said in previous debates.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like, first of all, to say something to Ms Ford, whose speech I listened to. Of course, it is not at all helpful to make an organisation responsible for the fact that things are not going as we would like. I do not believe that it is the European Commission’s fault that in certain respects, SMEs are not making the progress that we had hoped for.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I believe that restricting the discussion purely to financing issues does not help us. Where I come from in Germany, and I believe that this is not the case only in Germany, SMEs are not so much concerned about financing, although, of course, this may be a problem in individual situations. Primarily, they are worried about the fact that the legislation is so complex that it has become completely incomprehensible. Therefore, I believe that the discussion on the issue of how the definition of an SME can be made better, more precise and more targeted is an important matter, not only for SMEs, but in general terms for our legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that 99.5% of all companies are SMEs, and, Mr Wammen, you mentioned this, shows that we have a problem, because in principle, this means that all companies are affected and, therefore, our measures are not being accurately targeted. For this reason, I am very interested to see the results of Mr Tajani’s study, which aims to produce a new and more precise definition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Ms Ford’s question is, of course, along exactly the lines that I think we should be following here. Like you, Ms Ford, I believe that we should be focusing on greater segmentation of the concept of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because it does not help us if we are constantly discussing subsidies for SMEs, while at the same time the term covers more than 90% of all companies. This will ultimately not be possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that SMEs have very different interests. The very small companies, such as snack bars and similar businesses, are mainly interested in having very simple legislation involving very little red tape. However, there are also medium-sized companies, for example, in my constituency, which are so large that they have a particular interest in financing. We need to work together, Ms Ford, to set the right priorities.</p>

In particular, I agree with Vicky Ford that we should be concentrating particularly on smaller SMEs and micro-businesses and establishing set rules for those which are different to the others, in particular, in relation to bureaucracy, red tape and compliance. These are not only important economically; they are also important socially and culturally because they are usually found in the centre of towns. If they die, the town dies with them. So it is important that we give them access to funding and reduce red tape.</p>

It may be that these 24 million small enterprises will make people redundant, and that there will be 24 million new unemployed people.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Perhaps the most worrying thing is that, while Member States are endeavouring to balance their economies, value added tax is now being increased in almost all countries, making it difficult for small service companies. When value added tax goes up, prices rise, and when, at the same time, people’s pay and pensions are cut, there is no demand, and generating demand is now a key issue for service companies, Commissioner Hahn.</p>
      <p sl="fi">That is why the Commission really needs to make every effort to get us out of this economic crisis, and fast. Furthermore, the Member States have to be involved in the process: everything else is of less importance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Wales is one of the poorest regions in the EU and also has a very high dependence on micro and small businesses. Despite Wales receiving two rounds of structural funding, it has not seen a significant improvement in GDP, and we therefore need to apply the Structural Funds in a different way in order to stimulate economic productivity.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commissioner said in his opening remarks, if each SME were able to employ one new person, it would have a major impact on economic growth. Therefore, we need to ensure that regions are explicitly encouraged to take action to allow SMEs access to Structural Funds on a priority basis, and not just through JEREMIE and JESSICA.</p>
      <p sl="en">Civil servants cannot generate economic returns, but allowing our small businesses access to finance for employment and competitiveness could provide a major stimulus.

We have limited financial instruments in Europe which are intended precisely for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where it is indeed easiest to create new jobs. Where is the challenge; where is the problem? The definition of a small or medium-sized enterprise is currently so broad that it includes practically all – 99% – of European businesses. This means that businesses that are genuinely small and which really do find it difficult to obtain financing do not have the opportunities that they need.

One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I support all the activities that improve business conditions for SMEs in the EU. Our many programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises are, however, of little benefit. We talk and write a lot, but the effect of this work is not visible, and it gets lost in bureaucratic procedures. Small businesses are often established and run by people with only primary or secondary education. Therefore, both small businesses and entrepreneurs need simple rules for their establishment, operation, accounting and also their taxation. If we fail to force our governments to push through a simple and transparent scheme for the operation of small and medium-sized enterprises with a minimum of bureaucracy, officials in our countries will continue to bully small businesses. A rank-and-file governmental official will not dare to criticise a powerful large business. However, he can unashamedly make his importance felt to any small bakery or hairdresser.

A commitment has been made to more credit and less bureaucracy by June. And we are on the eve of the new Council at the end of May.</p>
      <p sl="es">I ask the Council: what has been done to free up these Structural Funds, to ensure better access to credit for SMEs? What measures are being taken to support the micro-enterprises? Is there a specific measure for youth employment?</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like the Council to take measures against the very significant crisis we are experiencing.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, today, speed is of the utmost importance. Speed for companies that are struggling to survive and develop. In contrast, institutions have been rather slow in their response. Obviously, small and medium-sized enterprises are affected by delays and procedural complexity.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Besides, if we want to motivate more young people to become entrepreneurs, we need to encourage them and we also need to provide more knowledge or, rather, more opportunities in the education system itself. According to polls in my country, Slovenia, alone, 60% of young people have not had the opportunity to learn anything about entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, information for all 23 million businesses. We know that the information channels may still be insufficiently open to all.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and, unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has had a powerful impact not only on their position, but also on their development prospects, with many SMEs not having any access to funding. Given that European funds are the main source of funding and obviously the only EU instruments for creating jobs and supporting SMEs, I think that:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. it is absolutely essential for the cohesion policy budget earmarked for this category of beneficiaries to be retained for the forthcoming programming period, and</p>
      <p sl="ro">2. it is absolutely vital to involve local and regional authorities right from the initial stages of outlining and developing the future operational programmes so as to apply a cohesion policy more effectively to support SMEs while, at the same time, funds must be allocated according to the areas’ specific features.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner, after all that has been said here, we can surely agree that small and medium-sized enterprises can be seen as a pillar of the European Union economy. They also play the role of a major employer, especially because all the large companies tend to have their headquarters in the Asian countries, mainly for cost reasons, which I personally consider to be socially and politically inappropriate, and I hope, Commissioner, that in the future, this Parliament will also discuss this topic. The economic crisis, however, has hit small and medium-sized enterprises hard. Although they are currently facing a difficult period in an effort to survive, they are much more successful than larger firms and are also more adaptable to the market situation. Paradoxically, they find it more difficult to gain financial support than large companies. In the light of the above facts and the enormous importance and the contribution of SMEs to the European economy, we need to focus on finding new ways to use the Structural Funds. We must focus on removing bureaucratic and administrative barriers and generally simplify the provision of credit to SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the media agenda seems to be rediscovering the importance of having a long-term growth strategy, although this growth has been part of our political priorities for several months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The economic recovery will obviously come about through better use of public resources to help companies that are creating jobs, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We should therefore recall that the 23 million SMEs in Europe are vital for economic development in our regions. Yet they have structural difficulties when it comes to obtaining financing, and the current crisis has only aggravated the situation. In February, we were already debating the use of regional funds here in Parliament to better combat youth unemployment and support SMEs. The Court of Auditors’ March report confirmed what we had already known for a long time: SMEs’ access to financial engineering instruments is far too complicated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, the Commission set aside a budget of EUR 27 billion for SMEs for this period. Do we know what has become of that budget? We all know the difficulties they are facing. The time has come, not so much to debate the definition of SMEs, but to determine how we can best take into account their differences and their needs when implementing our policies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for this debate. In the time of just under two and a half minutes that has been allocated to me, it will unfortunately not be possible for me to give a detailed answer to all the questions that have been asked, but you will receive a reply in writing. I would like to summarise some of the main issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is the current period and it is correct that restructuring measures are under way. However, it is now the job of the Member States to make appropriate proposals. You can be sure that the Commission will not only look favourably at the proposals, but will also take a proactive approach to all of those which aim to subsidise small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to combat unemployment, in particular among young people. I would like to ask for your support in your Member States and in your constituencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, subsidies for SMEs have often been discussed, in some cases with a focus on the future. For the forthcoming financial period, we have made highly specific proposals for the minimum funding in the budget to support SMEs. In my introductory speech, I said that 80% would go to the less developed regions and 50% to the more developed regions. I have listened to discussions in the Council and in this House which have been critical of these limits. If you really believe that we should invest in SMEs, in innovation and in competitiveness, I would ask you to make every effort to safeguard this minimum allocation in the budget. We definitely need to identify tailor-made solutions for the individual regions in future, using the best available banks, which should also be subject to a certain amount of competition. I agree with all those people who are critical of the fact that the mobilisation of the funds takes too long, from the start of the process through to the money reaching the beneficiaries. I also think this is too long-winded and we will see what we can do in future to improve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that one important measure, and other speakers have also mentioned this, could involve, for example, that part of the future financial framework, in other words, heading 1, which specifically concerns sustainable growth and which amounts to around EUR 500 billion. We could make a clear statement before the summer that this money will be available in the next financial period. This would definitely send out a strong signal to the citizens of Europe and also to the markets which would give them the security to plan ahead and to decide where investments should be made. I can imagine that this would provide an impetus and an incentive and that growth would be reinforced by concrete actions.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, this morning’s debate has focused on the issue of SMEs’ access to capital and the definition of SMEs. In view of the economic situation, on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to lend my support to this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="da">Access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial if we are to be able to continue to benefit from the economic growth to which small and medium-sized enterprises contribute, especially innovative companies. For the same reason, the Presidency is working on projects such as the creation of an internal market for venture capital, and is also trying to get as far as we can with the proposed Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME).</p>
      <p sl="da">Europe must ensure a good environment for small and medium-sized enterprises that provides them with the best framework conditions to allow them to develop and grow. In this connection, I should like to express my thanks for the many contributions made, including those from Mr Bendtsen and Ms Krehl. I have listened with great interest to the possibilities for combining work on energy efficiency with the creation of jobs for small and medium-sized enterprises. Both are very important priorities for the Danish Presidency, as part of our efforts to create green growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission’s Small Business Act of 2008 was also a significant step, and we must also emphasise the efforts made in many Member States. As an extension of this, the Presidency has chosen to focus on streamlining and the simplification of rules, such as the rules on tendering. Simpler rules on tendering will make it easier for SMEs to bid for contracts. Another example is the initiative to create a genuinely digital internal market, which is crucial for giving small and medium-sized enterprises access to growth opportunities. Thirdly, and this answers Mr Kalfin, Mr Rübig, Mr van Nistelrooij and others, an important element of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) involves ensuring that a greater portion of the EU budget is earmarked for growth-promoting measures, including both research and development, and enabling the resources of the Structural Funds to target these areas to a greater extent. This is an important part of the work that the Danish Presidency is carrying out in respect of the MFF agreement for the period 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="da">On that basis, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the support it has given to the Presidency’s work, and I am looking forward to the great efforts that we will make together – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – to ensure that Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises once again experience growth so that we can create jobs, not least for the millions of young people who have an expectation that together, we will deliver results for them.</p>

      <p sl="ga">It appears that at every second plenary sitting, we discuss the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), their central role in the EU economy, and their difficulties in obtaining funding. We have often mentioned the negative effect of excessive red tape on SMEs. Despite this, the situation has scarcely changed and Parliament’s best efforts have little effect on the daily difficulties of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The job loss in Ireland’s SME sector in recent years equates to 15% of the workforce. It is the same across the EU. I welcome the Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs which is to be implemented from 2014 to 2020 with a budget of EUR 2.5 billion. For those currently in charge of enterprises, however, 2014 is a long way away. I ask the Commission to provide information on the measures to be adopted by it immediately, in cooperation with Member States, to help SMEs in the short term. The obstacles to funding must be tackled without delay, along with excessive red tape and excessive administration.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I entirely agree with the Council and the Commission that small and medium-sized business is the basis of the European Union economy and a significant source of employment and job creation. The continuing crisis situation has left more than 25 million EU citizens unemployed and it is therefore necessary to exploit the potential of small and medium-sized business to contribute to reducing unemployment and creating jobs. I believe that access to financing is one of the main problems remaining, which is making the situation for small business worse. The Council member mentioned that over the period 2007-2014, small and medium-sized enterprises will have access to approximately EU 70 billion in financial assistance from the Structural Funds and various programmes for small business administered by the European Investment Bank. However, some years ago, there were more than a few misgivings about the effectiveness of assistance allocated because it emerged that the Member State commercial banks administering EIB financing during the crisis tightened lending conditions even more and this hampered SMEs’ opportunities to receive assistance from EU funds. The lack of information in the Member States about the accessibility of such financial assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises also remains a major barrier to using the assistance allocated. I believe that the Commission must provide data about the assistance that has so far been allocated to SMEs, how it was distributed in the Member States, and assess the effectiveness of that assistance and determine the most effective principles for the provision of assistance, so that SMEs can take advantage of financing opportunities in a timely manner.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Numerous SMEs in Europe are facing the problem of accessing capital, while the cohesion policy is meant to improve the current situation. Therefore, the instruments aimed at improving access to funding play a vital role. In Romania, SMEs account for 99.7% of all companies. In addition, they generate two-thirds of jobs. Funding is, indeed, one of the most serious problems that SMEs face as only 15% of them receive any credit from banks. This is why it is vital for them to be involved in projects financed by the Structural Funds as they provide an important source of development for small and medium-sized enterprises. The JEREMIE holding fund is subsidised in my country by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and its objectives are to achieve sustainable growth in the production sector. At the same time, another aim is to create an environment conducive to the development of businesses by adopting a flexible strategic approach. So far, roughly 6 000 contracts outlining funding have been signed, aimed at the SME sector, as part of the development programmes. I should emphasise the importance of retaining initiatives of this kind as part of the future cohesion policy. At the same time, I welcome the use of European funds in supporting the creation of SMEs, in particular by young people. This will spark the entrepreneurial spirit among them, thereby also ensuring economic growth and a decline in the unemployment rate.</p>

      <p sl="en">SMEs are blighted by the increasingly unobtainable access to finance and capital, a problem, for the most part, exacerbated by the ongoing ineptitude of the European Union in addressing problems that blight the eurozone, which, in turn, impact upon global markets. Equally, SMEs are the hardest hit when it comes to the application of heavy handed and unnecessary over-regulation by Brussels. The UK Government pledged to financially support small businesses and free up capital for investment yet have done nothing to hold banks accountable when they have failed to meet the prescribed targets – despite the government and taxpayer being a major shareholder in two high street banks. This issue does not require action from the EU, as such action, in line with all other EU policy making, is liable to be counterproductive to its objectives. Instead, it requires competence and commitment from the UK Government, which could only be achieved if the UK left the European Union and freed British business from the shackles of European regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">EU Structural Funds must show greater awareness of the needs of SMEs so that more SMEs are able to draw down EU funding. SMEs do not have the same capacity or resources as larger firms to prepare detailed applications. We need less red tape. The economic crisis has hit the SME sector more than the larger enterprise sector – twice the number of jobs have been lost in the SME sector than in the larger enterprise sector. SMEs have proven their job potential in the past – 85% of all new jobs created in the EU between 2002-10 were in SMEs – and can do so again. Over the past couple of years, the EIB has provided loans of EUR 250 million to Irish banks for onward lending to SMEs. It is not clear how much of this has actually reached SMEs. The commitments under the proposed Competitiveness and SME programme (COSME) to better monitor EU lending to SMEs must therefore be fleshed out and strengthened.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Small and medium-sized enterprises play an extremely important role in the European economy. It is therefore crucial that we facilitate their access to the Structural Funds, which, in these times of economic and financial crisis, can provide them with the investment opportunities and financial resources they may rely on for survival.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The current instruments and forms of support do not always reach those beneficiaries that are truly in need of them. Unnecessary administrative burdens and the pre-financing obligation continue to pose a problem to most small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The definition of SMEs should be reassessed, as the 2005 definition can be considered obsolete in many ways. SMEs constitute 99% of all European companies, and their importance is further demonstrated by the fact that between 2005 and 2010, 85% of all new jobs in Europe were created by SMEs. It is clear that the key to the growth and development of a Europe in the process of recovering from the crisis lies in these enterprises, and it is therefore important that the Commission support SMEs’ access to Structural Funds by all means available.</p>

      <p sl="it">In a single market without internal borders, like the European market, it is vital that all Member States agree a definition of small and medium-sized enterprises. This will then ensure that the measures taken to determine and control eligibility for funding are consistent and do not create imbalances in the market. It is therefore important that the currently applicable definitions of ‘micro-’, ‘small-’ and ‘medium-sized’ enterprises not be changed. The proposal to raise the size limit for a medium-sized enterprise from 250 to 1 000 employees would effectively create a two-tier system in which companies of quite dissimilar size and wealth would be categorised together, thus inevitably favouring the larger organisations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The obstacles hampering the growth of SMEs must be removed in order to emerge from the current economic situation. In addition, faced with the economic crisis, SMEs are experiencing ever increasing difficulties in obtaining funding and accessing the market. New innovative businesses need to have better access to financial support in the form of start-up aid. The Commission must take the following specific steps, which are essential in facilitating the implementation of an entrepreneurial framework: - draft a plan for launching on the market and selling innovative products; - devise a clear strategy to ensure that every European citizen has the opportunity to work in another Member State; - establish a new set of measures for SMEs in order to implement a new energy efficiency plan. The economic crisis will persist as long as there are no jobs. This is why creating new jobs in sectors such as energy, the construction of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, transport and communications provides economic development projects capable of reducing the regional imbalances and development inequalities in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">SMEs are a linchpin of economic growth in the EU, with their contribution to innovation and technological development, and they have considerable potential for creating jobs. To achieve these objectives, businesses need support from the EU by means of extensive funding.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The attraction of SMEs is their high level of adaptability. I regret to note that, at the moment, a European telecoms giant can no longer keep pace with rival producers in third countries. This situation does not similarly apply to European SMEs in this sector, which have been able to tailor their offering to market requirements. Apart from structural support, businesses need to benefit from local assistance programmes. The Enterprise Europe Network provides them with integrated information, transfer services, innovation and technology, funding and legislation in this area. Horizontal cooperation may bring regions considerable benefits. This is why it should be promoted accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should stress the importance of the financial instruments supplied to SMEs by the Commission and EIB. In countries like Romania, the technical assistance programmes have delivered results and are continuing to provide necessary support to the business sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">() For many years now, the European Union has advocated, at least on paper, subsidising small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In practice, SMEs are still faced with significant bureaucratic obstacles. While large organisations can afford to hire experts to help them to take advantage of all the loopholes, over-regulation is thwarting small companies at every turn, taking up much of their time and money and, as a result, slowing down economic activity. In particular, the increasingly stringent regulations imposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have been draining the financial lifeblood from SMEs, which are already under-capitalised. In addition, these companies have been hard hit by the slowdown in economic growth caused by the sovereign debt crisis. Against the background of the global recession, the business climate for SMEs has deteriorated. It is still easy for large companies to access subsidies, while medium-sized businesses are almost reduced to begging. If 99% of European businesses, which are also the largest employers, have access to only 10 to 15% of European funding, it is high time that the EU’s system of subsidising large companies and multinationals is changed, by renationalising the subsidy system. In addition, tendering processes and public procurement must finally be made more SME-friendly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As part of this debate, I would like to emphasise how important the JEREMIE (‘Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises’) initiative is. It offers Member States the opportunity to use part of their EU Structural Funds to finance small and medium-sized enterprises by means of equity, loans or guarantees through a revolving holding fund. At present, one of the toughest problems encountered by SMEs in attracting Structural Funds is the lack of cofinancing capacity. Indeed, in the present climate, continuing, developing and diversifying initiatives like JEREMIE as part of the future cohesion policy would be necessary and beneficial to many entrepreneurs. However, far more effort ought to be made to raise public awareness of initiatives of this kind among those interested in this, with efficient measures also being required to cut the excessive red tape.</p>

      <p sl="et">The situation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union must be taken very seriously, since SMEs make up over 99% of the total number of companies in both Estonia and the EU, and it is therefore important that financing from European Union Structural Funds and other financial resources should be available to that large majority. I believe that the situation of SMEs and the use of European Union funding should be made more efficient and that it must be ensured that there is no repeat of the liquidity crisis which took place during the financial crisis and which had a particularly strong effect on SMEs. Another extremely important issue is the reduction in bureaucracy in order to ensure that SMEs have greater and easier access to support from Structural Funds, and also to ensure the subsequent monitoring of its use. The requirements for the preparation and submission of annual reports and financial reporting by SMEs should also be harmonised and simplified in order to reduce their administrative burden. I sincerely hope that the increased and simplified accessibility of financial resources and structural support to small and medium-sized companies will, in the near future, help give a significant boost to the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">At this time, when all national governments are taking restrictive measures in their budgets, the impact on small businesses is palpable. Many of them are going under at the expense of the creation of a grey economy. It is therefore a good thing that the Commission has come up with proposals for SMEs to have the opportunity to gain access to the Structural Funds. During the crisis, there has been a tightening of credit conditions, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, increasing the capacity of loan guarantee programmes, investment in equity funds and micro-credit programmes for SMEs is a way for services and employment to develop and grow. However, together with these new measures, we need tighter, more thorough supervision of compliance with current guidelines which are designed to create conditions for the stabilisation and growth of SMEs, for example, Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions. This directive requires public authorities to make payments within 30 days. The facts are alarming: if small and medium-sized enterprises want to win a contract, they are forced to negotiate repayment terms of 2-4 months, both in the public and governmental sectors.</p>

We have heard a great deal over recent weeks about actions to kick start growth and combat unemployment, especially among young people. This kick start to growth could begin with SMEs and with action to strengthen their competitiveness. European money has already contributed a great deal to this sector, but I am convinced that much more can be done. We must ensure in the new programming period for cohesion policy that we include long-term actions that will improve access for SMEs to the Structural Funds and simplify procedures, so as to relieve the administrative burden and cut the red tape that often gets in the way of their business. We also need regional autonomy in the choice of programmes for SMEs financed from the Structural Funds and to encourage operators at all levels to become involved in promoting business.</p>

According to the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics, Portugal’s unemployment rate is 14.9%, with youth unemployment at 36.2%. At the end of the European Council meeting in January 2012, Dr Barroso suggested that the Member States should restructure EUR 82 billion of Community funds, and Portugal has already submitted its strategic plan. It is therefore crucial that the Commission reach a quick decision on this plan, so that it can come into force quickly. Recently, in this very Chamber in Strasbourg, the European Commission tabled a new package of measures intended to create more job opportunities and to support entrepreneurship. I believe that SMEs should have easier access to the new package of measures, and that an action plan should be set out including targets and metrics for their implementation. Finally, I should like to quote Dr Barroso: ‘Europe needs a job-creation strategy to tackle its unacceptable level of unemployment. The EU has a large untapped potential to boost job creation’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Access to independent visitors is especially important if we are to build a clear picture of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko’s situation and, in this respect, I welcome recent visits, including by Members of the European Parliament. Most important, in terms of Ms Tymoshenko’s legal rights, is that Ukraine’s Court of Cassation should announce its decision on her case at the end of June, and that the European Court of Human Rights can announce its own decision shortly afterwards. This also applies in the case of Mr Lutsenko, whose sentence was recently upheld on appeal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any future trials should strictly respect the provisions of the new Ukrainian Code of Criminal Procedure, thus providing for equality between defence and prosecution, and should operate without pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our concern about selective justice remains strong. Last Tuesday, at the Cooperation Council with Ukraine, we clearly set out to Prime Minister Azarov how we believe Ukraine can get back on the road to political association. The political relationship between the European Union and Ukraine will not improve without firm commitments and an effective demonstration that the rule of law and respect for fundamental values are applied systematically in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have repeatedly stressed to our Ukrainian partners that we will not be able to move towards signing our association agreement if they cannot show that they live in the spirit of political association. To this end, we expect Ukraine to make visible progress. The recent adoption of the new Code of Criminal Procedure in Ukraine was certainly a step forward, and it should improve the quality of future prosecutions and trials. However, Ms Tymoshenko and other victims of politically motivated justice have already been sentenced. Action to reform the Criminal Code, defining what is to be considered a criminal offence, is needed to get to the heart of this problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the initiative taken by President Schulz in asking Prime Minister Azarov to accept that a person of high international repute be sent on behalf of the European Parliament to observe the second trial, with full access to judges, lawyers and documents. The parliamentary elections in October will also be an important test. We will observe very closely the conditions in which the electoral campaign and the voting process proceed. It is important, if Ukraine wants to fulfil its European aspirations, that the elections should be free and fair beyond doubt.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wish to mention the European Parliament resolutions calling on the Commission to support judicial reform in Ukraine. In December last year, the Commission signed a financing agreement of EUR 10 million with Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice. It aims to accelerate sustainable reforms in the justice sector in Ukraine, with a particular focus on criminal justice reforms. We have also recently agreed to engage with Ukraine in an informal dialogue on judiciary reform, drawing on the expertise of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">To summarise, what we expect from Ukraine before we can once again move forward is: firstly, a concrete strategy to redress the effect of selective justice and prevent any recurrence of it; secondly, free and fair elections; and thirdly, the resumption of delayed reforms already agreed in the joint EU-Ukraine ‘Association Agenda’ which has now been in force for two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention. I look forward to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, establishing and applying the rule of law and democracy in a credible way and respecting human rights are requirements for countries which want a European perspective. It is clear that Ukraine has been moving in the opposite direction over the last two years. Counterfeit goods have been produced, the judicial system has been politicised and there have been political trials. The leaders of the opposition are in prison as a result of politically motivated judgments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Füle, I agree with you that this is a systemic issue. The problem is rooted in the system and it cannot be eliminated simply by introducing formal reforms. There must also be the determination and the readiness to apply them, to put the rule of law and democracy into practice and to take the consequences. This could be done now. We have been discussing the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuri Lutsenko and many others for almost a year. New promises are constantly made and new procedures are initiated, but the promises are not kept and none of the measures are properly implemented. Instead, one gets the impression that the government is playing for time. Postponing the session of the court of appeal also seems to me to be a case of gaining time which will ultimately make it possible to prevent opposition politicians from taking part in the next elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the crucial point. There can only be free and fair elections if the leaders of the opposition can participate in them on equal terms. The judicial system must not be used to stop this from happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">When matters are resolved in the court of appeal and then new cases are brought, which are actually old cases that the supreme court has ruled on several times in order to settle issues which have to do with the statute of limitations, that also represents an abuse of the rule of law. For this reason, Mr Füle, I believe that you are right.</p>
      <p sl="de">Because of the importance of Ukraine being a part of Europe, we are in favour of the association agreement. The European Parliament would be prepared to ratify the agreement very quickly and to support it being signed, if Ukraine fulfilled certain requirements. By initialling the agreement, we have shown that we are willing to do this. Now the ball is in the Ukrainian Government’s court. I hope that the government does not believe that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will get tired if it waits long enough and that, as a result, it will get something which it would not have achieved if it did not meet the requirement of introducing the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we agree in this House that Ukraine is a country of strategic importance for us – its size, its geographical location, its educated people – so for all these and other reasons, an association agreement has been concluded and initiated. I think we would like to see those who signed this agreement implement this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is a problem. It is not only Yulia Tymoshenko and Mr Lutsenko but, as has already been mentioned, we have to deal with serious deficiencies in Ukraine’s legal system. Partnership between the EU and Ukraine should be based on the observation of human rights, the rule of law and, of course, the functioning of the entire legal system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Ukrainian partners attempted to make certain reforms. Here, I would like to mention the Criminal Procedure Code which has been adopted. Moreover, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe participated in the preparation of this Criminal Procedure Code – but we have to go further. The entire legal system of Ukraine has to be reformed. Again, I would like to welcome the decision to establish a constitutional assembly which, again, will carry out its work with the experts from the Venice Commission and, I hope, also with the opposition in Ukraine and with civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">How to deal with Yulia Tymoshenko’s case? Now the case will go before Ukraine’s High Specialised Court. Last week, we heard a statement by President Azarov, who invited us to send international legal experts. I think that is a first step towards dealing with this issue in such a way that the release of Yulia Tymoshenko is in accordance with both international law and Ukrainian law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case, of course, will perhaps go to this city, to Strasbourg, to the European Court of Human Rights. The Ukrainian side promised – and I think we should insist on that – that the verdict and, of course, the implementation of the Court’s judgment will be fully respected.</p>

One is whether Mr Rouček is aware that the Czech Government has granted political asylum to Mr Danylyshyn, the former Ukrainian Minister for the Economy. This is only granted when the person is suffering from political persecution. I would also like to know what he thinks of this fact.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Yes, the Czech Government gave political asylum to the former Economics Minister. As far as I know, there were reasons to give him asylum; but this is exactly what we are talking about here today: that in many cases, we have the feeling – and not only the feeling – of selective political justice. This is why we are having this debate today and why we would like to see an improvement along the lines already mentioned, but also involving further reforms as far as the judicial system is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Social Democrats and the Party of Regions: yes, it is true that, a year-and-a-half ago, a memorandum was signed where we expressed our will to help the Ukrainian side to develop the party, society and political system in the Ukraine in accordance with our values, as I mentioned: human rights, civil rights, rule of law, democracy. We therefore urge our colleagues in the Party of Regions to implement what they agreed to. This year will be decisive, both in the case of Yulia Tymoshenko and, of course, later on in October with the elections, in terms of whether they will be able to implement what they agreed to.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ukraine is at a crossroads. The country could either go the same way as Belarus, which would mean that there is no longer only one ‘last dictatorship’ in Europe but two (and there may be other contenders for that, Mr Landsbergis), or Ukraine could develop into a modern democracy. This is also possible, because today, Ukraine is not Belarus and should not develop that way. With regard to the rule of law, I must say that indeed there is probably some progress, but it must materialise.</p>
      <p sl="de">This means that the Tymoshenko case is a test case. There are other cases, but we should use this case to see whether progress is being made or not. It is true that Ms Tymoshenko is being treated better than before, but this should not be the end of the case. The Court of Cassation should be free, fair, open and transparent in the revision of court cases. If you look further, the way homosexuals were treated in a demonstration – which had to be cancelled – is a bad thing. Ukraine should accept that everybody is equal. The fact that there is a law before the Rada saying that homosexuality should not be propagated is a bad thing because education on this issue should be transparent, free and fair. Again, Ukraine should change in this respect. As the Commissioner said, the coming elections – whether they are free or fair – are also a benchmark.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not in favour of a boycott of the European football championship. Why not? We are having these discussions because of the championship in the same way that we talked about human rights in China because of the Olympic Games. We should use the opportunity; those who represent their countries in Ukraine should use the opportunity to draw the attention to the human rights situation. Ukraine need not become like Belarus. Let us help her not to do so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the debate about whether or not football is political has ultimately given rise to significant public interest in the situation and the developments in Ukraine, a result which we have repeatedly tried in vain to achieve in the past. I am also pleased that the cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and of the former ministers, Yuri Lutsenko and Heorhiy Filipchuk, are receiving the appropriate level of attention. When we show our solidarity with Ms Tymoshenko, I strongly believe that we should always refer to the full list of politicians and former high-ranking officials who are now in prison for political reasons as a result of a retaliation campaign organised by the regime of President Yanukovych. This is not only about Yulia Tymoshenko. It is about the systematic persecution of the relevant leaders of the opposition parties in Ukraine. I think that we have made progress in raising public awareness of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, having reached this point, we must not stop. Therefore, I would like to urge the EU once again not to choose the simple solution, which would be to say that we will boycott the European Championships in Ukraine. I am of the opinion that we should boycott the Ukrainian Government together with those, including the President, who support this unjust judicial system. However, we should not boycott the citizens of Ukraine. The original idea of holding the European Championships within the EU and in one the EU’s neighbouring countries is exactly the right one and it should continue to apply. The European Championships must lead to an increase in discussions and debates about democracy. All of those who are officially taking part should make very clear their criticism of the legal proceedings against Ms Tymoshenko and other politicians who are currently in prison.</p>
      <p sl="de">The best outcome would be if this unjust legal case were to be dropped before the football starts. I do not know if the Ukrainian Government has the insight to do this. At this stage, it is important for us to continue our criticism. In my opinion, the association agreement, which has not been paid as much attention during the course of the debate as the football has, should not be signed while the judicial system in the Ukraine remains unchanged.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next elections must genuinely show that Ukraine is moving towards democracy and the rule of law. We must focus on calling for the former leading opposition politicians to take part in the elections as opposition candidates. It is not enough just to release them. They must be rehabilitated.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both during the meeting we had with Yulia Tymoshenko and the one we had in prison with Yuri Lutsenko, we talked most about Ukraine’s route to Europe. This is the real aspiration of the people of Ukraine. I would like to ask if it is true that all of us in the Chamber today are able to say that if Ukraine changes, we will support its journey into Europe? Did we all support Ms Tymoshenko’s government on this? Each of us ought to think about how we voted three years ago. Are we really being sincere about this?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Two questions are important at the moment. Firstly, we need to show this prospect to Ukraine, not to this or that government, but to the citizens of Ukraine, as Ms Harms has said. We need to show them this possibility, and then demand change. This change must be very specific, it must concern those who today have been unjustly sentenced, and it must concern reforms to the judicial system and of local government. This is a very important matter, something to which Prime Minister Azarov has also committed himself. It will place authority and decisions back in the hands of all Ukrainians – people who are watching us today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, and this is very important: I would like to express heartfelt thanks to Mr Schulz for this initiative, and to Commissioner Füle for his real efforts to resolve the situation in Ukraine. Help is still needed from you both in another matter. Mr Schulz, I would like to ask you to ensure that the delegation of observers is a big one. Commissioner Füle, perhaps it will be possible to find additional funds so that some of the citizens of the European Union can go and support the elections – they can be given training and go as observers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us have a repeat of what happened in 2004. This is the real expectation of all parties and political groups in Ukraine. Let us all go there as neighbours and with the proper preparation – and not just politicians, but also non-governmental organisations. This will be a real expression of neighbourly goodwill. Let us say clearly today that if Ukraine changes, we will have the courage to say: yes, you do have the prospect of European Union membership. Let us say boldly at this point that as neighbours, we can do something specific today – we can go and observe the elections.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is true that concern over respect for human rights in Ukraine is a cause of legitimate doubts and most certainly demands a reaction. It is natural that the European Union should call upon Ukraine, too, to maintain human rights, democratic standards and the proper operation of its justice system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is legitimate to talk about the dubious situation in relation to Ms Tymoshenko, as well as about other examples which have given rise to doubt over respect for standards in Ukraine. However, a completely separate matter which should nevertheless be mentioned at this point is the question of boycotting Euro 2012 and the decision to do so which has, after all, been announced publicly by the European Commission. The question arises as to whether such a decision is, in fact, helpful in this matter, a matter about which we are all concerned – raising democratic standards. Are we sure that such a decision will also help resolve the dramatic situation of the former Premier of Ukraine?</p>
      <p sl="pl">We know today that the Ukrainian opposition has not joined this kind of demand for a boycott or for the outright removal of this great sporting event from Ukraine. We know the majority of the Ukrainian people have been waiting five years for the chance to enjoy the experience associated with this celebration of European football. We also saw in this the chance for greater integration and a way to bring the Ukrainian people closer to the European Union and to Europe. We know, too, that a decision to impose a boycott of any kind can only push Ukraine into the hands of Putin’s Russia, who today is already posing as a defender of Ukraine and criticising the European Commission, something which is certain to gain him points with a fairly sizeable section of the Ukrainian nation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is something which requires both tact and wisdom. The question also arises about our standards here in the European Union. Are we going to be equally principled in the case of the Sochi Winter Olympics, which are being organised by Russia – a country which also occupies one third of the territory of the independent country of Georgia? Are we going to be equally principled in the case of Belarus, which is hosting the World Ice Hockey Championship – are we going to demand a boycott there too? Finally, on what grounds is the European Commission making statements about a boycott, since, in fact, it is not authorised to speak on the subject? Ms Ashton has not said anything here, and she of course is authorised to take a position and to coordinate that position with individual Member States. This, too, is missing, because there has been no consultation of the position on this with Poland, which is, after all, co-hosting the European Championship.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it is clearly no longer fashionable to measure everyone, including the most senior statesmen, by the same yardstick. The various corruption scandals in EU countries do not bother us in the slightest. It is only exceptionally that a former statesman is convicted, as was recently the case with French President Chirac. Some EU states offer political asylum to fraudsters and, at the same time, try to put pressure on neighbouring countries to provide special privileges to former top politicians, contrary to the principles of equal treatment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am not a big football fan, but the tendency to link the European football tournament in Ukraine with the sentencing of former premier, Yulia Tymoshenko, has come as an unpleasant surprise. It is a fact that I have been trying for years to get more young women into top-level politics. It does not follow from this in any way, of course, that I would approve special conditions for privileged prisoners to serve out their punishments and special forms of treatment, in a country with several million people unemployed and homeless. Such an approach from politicians on the right does not surprise me. They have long been pushing for debts caused by the banks to be paid off by reducing the social standards of the poorest, even at the cost of high unemployment and dismantling the social state.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to make noisy protest against the European Parliament exporting such behaviour – including impunity for large-scale fraudsters – to countries outside the EU. In the case of Yulia Tymoshenko and people connected with her, some of the proposals violate the principle of equal treatment for citizens. It is not possible to grant political asylum to the fraudsters we call oligarchs in Eastern Europe, and then to hold a noisy debate about economic sanctions against those who are trying to rid themselves of the worst forms of corruption.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I propose, ladies and gentlemen, that we put our own house in order first. I would like to recommend in particular that MEPs from the so-called new EU states acquaint us with the anti-corruption measures recently adopted in their own countries. Only then would I like to hear their views on the situation in Ukraine. It is not only football, but also politics that must finally start to acknowledge the rules of fair play.</p>

As far as the fraudsters are concerned, I do not know how you can explain the fact that an entire group of people with assets running into the billions appeared practically overnight. Is this legal?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we all know that political pressure is unlikely to bring about either the release of the imprisoned opposition leader Ms Tymoshenko or democratic reforms in Ukraine. Even if the politicians in Kiev meet the demands from Brussels, we run the risk that the people of the country will not forget the interference from outside, from Brussels, which they regard as a humiliation. The fact that the EU can send officials to monitor court proceedings and doctors to ensure that Ms Tymoshenko receives medical treatment represents a clear concession which calls into question a boycott of the European Football Championships.</p>
      <p sl="de">The criminal proceedings against Ms Tymoshenko were, of course, highly arbitrary. However, we must ask ourselves whether it makes sense to put at risk the current relatively workable relationship with Kiev. In the light of the EU’s short-sighted policy with regard to Ukraine, we should not be surprised if the Ukrainians move further away from Europe and towards the Russian alternative in the elections which are planned for October.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate in the House and the resolution that will be adopted afterwards, we wanted to highlight the importance of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine for the country’s European prospects, and as we have been reminded in this debate, a key element of the agreement is the democracy clause on respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and respect for the rules of the democratic game.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, without questioning the hosting of the European Football Championships, which is being organised jointly with Poland, I believe, and I am addressing you, Commissioner, that the European Union should try to give a joint response, given that we are supposed to be trying to establish a common foreign and security policy, as such that the representatives of the European Union and the Member States can act in a homogenous, joint manner from a shared standpoint.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clear statement about Ukraine and the case of Yulia Tymoshenko. I have a question, however.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe you indicated, Commissioner, that the entry into force of the association agreement will be linked not only to the case of Tymoshenko, but to the free and fair elections to be organised this autumn. Of course that is important, but my question is: does it mean that you do not envisage making any move before the elections in Ukraine this year?</p>
      <p sl="en">Building a democracy is a long-term process – as we have seen within the European Union, where some of the Central and Eastern European countries still have ups and downs in terms of democratic development. What is important, however, is that the authorities understand the problems and work on them. Unfortunately, we have seen our eastern neighbourhood somehow getting less democratic in recent years, in contrast to the southern neighbourhood. There is a subject for further study there. I am not going to enter into details now, but, while it is too much to compare Ukraine to Belarus, it is true that, not only in Ukraine but also in some other countries, we see these backward steps, and we have to take account of them. We have to show consistency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind you that two Member States of the European Union – Bulgaria and Romania – are subject to special mechanisms in the field of the judiciary, simply because high-level corruption and abuses of power were not tackled. Currently, two prime ministers are in the spotlight: one of them, in Romania, has been sentenced and the other one is under investigation and may be fined on certain charges. So we should not, in principle, deny that former prime ministers, ministers and other high-level politicians have to face justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should, however, also seek to prevent countries from slipping back into a situation of impunity, and that goes for the current government and current ministers too. Ukraine belongs to Europe, and we should do our best to avoid it rushing into any kind of Asia-related project. The S&amp;D Group will continue to use its relations with the parties of the region to mediate in this delicate situation. Once again, we emphasise that we share the evaluation of the situation, and especially that selective justice is not acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Thank you for your question. This is a memorandum concerning some joint work and activities, and it does not imply a long-term political connection with this party. Of course we are exerting pressure and working at different levels, including at the highest level. As you can see, these relations help to continue the dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities. Of course, if we do not see any change, we will reconsider the agreement. We have made this clear to our partners as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the situation is simple. We have done a great deal in terms of the association agreement so that Ukraine would introduce the rule of law and the right standards. This, however, has not happened. The whole situation with the imprisonment of members of the opposition and the threats of further imprisonments has made this situation much worse. We cannot allow representatives of the European institutions to behave as if nothing has changed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Much has been said here about a boycott, because a boycott can take different forms. I for one do not imagine that the representatives of the European institutions should officially attend the championship, sit in a VIP box and applaud the matches. If they like football so much, let them buy a ticket with their own money, sit with the spectators and enjoy the football as private persons, not as European politicians representing the European institutions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Yulia Tymoshenko is clearly not Ukraine’s only problem, but her case is symbolic of the political situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What, then, are the problems? Last week’s report from the Commission highlighted the following: an increasing centralisation of power, rising corruption and the very selective way in which it is tackled, the ever-deteriorating treatment of prisoners and a growing anti-homosexual climate that is now even threatening to be enshrined in law.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore call on the Ukrainian parliament to reject this law. Ukraine needs to get away from the culture of political pay-offs, as those benefiting today are the victims of tomorrow, and vice versa. This culture is all about holding on to power, rather than using that power to help the country progress.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, next month, the eyes of the world will turn to Ukraine when football’s European Championships take place. Unfortunately, the cameras will not be solely focused on the pitch, but also on the political institutions in Kiev, the prisons right across the country and on the Tymoshenko case in particular.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I sincerely hope that, next month, the world will be talking about players like Shevchenko and Tymoshchuk, rather than about Tymoshenko and Lutsenko. Only the Yanukovych regime can ensure that, however. Necessary political changes would not only lead to a successful football championships, but also, I believe, to a successful association agreement.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Ukraine has progressed further than any other Euronest country on the path to EU accession. It should be an example to others, but unfortunately, it is not. It is failing to meet the political criteria. The entire democratic world is concerned about selective application of the law to political opponents. The prosecutor works to political orders, and the prison administration grossly violates prisoners’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted under laws that are contrary to EU and UN standards. Even if it has been possible, under enormous pressure, to stop her being tortured and to begin treatment, her rights are still being grossly violated. It is only the tip of the iceberg, beneath which lies political interference in the judiciary. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated last year against 400 disloyal judges. The aim is to frighten citizens, silence the opposition and re-establish one-party government, with some sections of the European left standing by and possibly even helping out.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I do not know what is worse – the legal misuse of prisoners’ medical information or the deliberate, massive disinformation campaign of the prosecutor, the Health Ministry and the President. It amounts to an enormous abuse of public power for political gain, reinforcement of the power of pro-government oligarchs and increasing corruption. Ladies and gentlemen, the independence of the forthcoming autumn elections is now in doubt, and this greatly saddens me. It will lead the beautiful country of Ukraine and its citizens further away from the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Blue-card question. – Ms Roithová has been good enough to make several fairly uncompromising statements. Firstly, Ms Roithová, you said that the public prosecution service in Ukraine is controlled by the government. In my country, only six months ago, the Minister for Justice was also the Prosecutor General and there were no objections to this. Do you and your party not think, firstly, that Ukraine is, in fact, making some progress, and secondly, that Ukraine is not becoming similar to Belarus, but that we are dealing here with a struggle which will either bring Ukraine into the European Union or see Ukraine come under the thumb of Russia?</p>

      <p sl="cs">Blue-card answer. – In my opinion, this is not the time for us to be discussing the political orientation of Ukraine, but the way in which the prosecutor is conducting trial, while knowing it is contrary to EU standards and knowing that we are about to sign an association agreement, clearly points to a selective application of the law. The disinformation which the prosecutor, Mr Pšonka, directly disseminates about the health situation and other factors, is also clearly a flagrant case of violation of democracy in Ukraine. However, I very much welcome the fact that the parliament and the government are ready to reform the judiciary. Unfortunately, the reform cannot be applied retrospectively to the cases of Tymoshenko and Lutsenko.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we talk a lot about Ukraine, the subject comes up in our debates practically every month, and I would ask you all to look at it from the perspective of whether the colours black and white are the right ones to describe the situation there. Shameful things are going on there, because it is shameful to put a former prime minister and several ministers in prison. However, very good things are also happening – reforms are being introduced which make all the legislation associated with the fiscal treaty look simple. Reforms of tax law have been brought in, along with reforms of penal law. At the same time, things have never been so bad in Ukraine in terms of the economic climate. Never before have foreign investors been making such complaints about the legal system in Ukraine. However, in the very same country, new electoral legislation has been adopted in good time and with the agreement of the opposition. In the very same country, the opposition has united, in order to work together against the Party of the Regions. So I would like us to know all this before we say unthinkingly that a new Belarus is emerging or that the situation is just a complete disaster.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This year, elections are to be held in which the citizens of Ukraine must have the right – we can help them in this – to say in a national poll if they support the policy of the Party of the Regions or not. This is a fundamental matter for this year. In relation to this, we should ensure that the elections are free and fair, because we do have the appropriate tools for this – we have already done this once before, when, a few years ago, we were able to secure free and fair elections in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The authorities in Ukraine are not helping us. Talking about standards in the field of human rights is a waste of breath and does not achieve anything. However, what also horrifies me is the chorus of wise guys in the European Union who want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, who think that Ukraine is a lost cause and that we should break off talks with Ukraine and so in fact push it into the arms of Moscow. Moscow is sitting quietly with its ‘hands off’, but all these zealots are, in fact, implementing Moscow’s policy for it, and I want to protest against this. We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Finally, I would like to welcome Yevgenia Tymoshenko and say we are keeping our fingers crossed for her struggle to secure her mother’s release.</p>

Not in order to draw out this debate, but because I think it is important that we do not have an ideological debate in this House. We need a balanced debate and one that will, first and foremost, help Ukraine and its population come closer to the EU, that is, help them come closer by one road or another, to their European dream.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Ms Roithová, my question is as follows: you have referred to legislation which allows abuse and which puts prosecutors, courts and so on in a situation that is not consistent with our standards. However, did the government led by Ms Tymoshenko do anything to change the legislation on the basis of which it ruled the country, the very same legislation that was in force during the Stalin era? Allow me to make one final remark: it was wrong to lock up Ms Tymoshenko and the way she is being treated in Ukraine is also wrong.</p>

Mr Siwiec, following the Orange Revolution – because many who were Members of this House at the time are still Members today – when Yulia Tymoshenko was Prime Minister, was the House so ready to support moves to open up Ukraine’s road to Europe, or were there continual problems with this? I think we should explain this clearly today, because there was a time when Yulia Tymoshenko was in power and she could have been helped. I hope that when she is in power again, we will not refuse her that help.</p>

However, when the Orange group was in power in Ukraine, the situation was similar, except that at that time, the association agreement did not exist, because in fact, no matter how much some of us may not like this, the association agreement was negotiated by representatives of the Party of the Regions and it is they who have put this document on the table today. This does not alter the fact that one way or the other, many people’s attitude to Ukraine is the same now as it was before.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as Mr Siwiec has just said, this is not the first debate that we have held on the subject of Ukraine and, as has so often been the case before, large parts of this debate have been unproductive and predictable. Why is this? The answer is quite simple. The Batkivshchyna is a party which follows the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, as we have just heard, the Party of the Regions has an agreement with the Socialists. In other words, the PPE group is now making a big fuss, puffing out its cheeks and running a poster campaign to create a good photo opportunity, while the Socialists are giving speeches about the situation in Ukraine which they ought to be ashamed of. This is a softly-softly approach which glosses over the reality of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">This type of debate does not do justice to the strategic or the humanitarian dimension of the problem. Ukraine is a large country with a population of 50 million. It lies between Russia, the European Union and the Black Sea. For 20 years, it has been stagnating in economic, democratic and social terms. Of course, that was also the case under the Yushchenko/Tymoshenko government. I believe that we now need to put the focus on the political and humanitarian dimension. We must ensure that democracy has a chance at the elections in October. However, Mr Füle, the electoral campaign is already under way. I would like some very precise information from the Commission and the European External Action Service about how they plan to implement the measures that you have just described, in other words, the close monitoring of the electoral campaign and the elections themselves. I would like our two guests, Hryhoriy Nemyria and Yevgenia Tymoshenko, to take away more from today’s debate than just the usual disputes between left and right. To Ms Tymoshenko, I would like to say in particular that I hope her mother receives the medical treatment she needs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it needs to be said with a degree of clarity that there are countries in Europe which do not want Ukraine in the European Union. Furthermore, there are also MEPs in this Chamber who do not want Ukraine in the European Union. The case of Yulia Tymoshenko – the shameful and unacceptable case – is being used to block Ukraine’s road to Europe for ever, and this is being done in cooperation with Russia. In cooperation with a Russia which murders journalists, bans all kinds of demonstrations and imprisons political activists. We ought to remember this and always keep this in view.</p>

The situation would be exactly the reverse if the government in Ukraine were different. That is what I mean. We must be open and clear about this.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, by initialling the association agreement with Ukraine, the EU has made it clear what we are prepared to do in our relations with that country. However, the discrepancy between what are said to be our shared values and the reality in the country is growing ever greater. The regime believes that only by keeping the opposition leader, Ms Tymoshenko, and other members of her government in prison can it be sure of winning the parliamentary elections in October.</p>
      <p sl="de">Power is becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of the Yanukovych family and its close associates who are seeking to increase their own wealth. Key positions in the ministry of the interior, the tax authorities and the central bank, among other organisations, are now held by these people. Then the prime minister’s son, Alexander, goes on a shopping trip and buys up small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country, with the support of the tax authorities. He suddenly appears on the list of the richest people in Ukraine and his wealth has obviously grown significantly within the space of a year. The population responds with resignation and apathy to shameless acts of this kind, which simply serve to increase the family’s personal fortune, and to the imprisonment of the opposition. However, the people also remember that the Orange camp during its period in government also spent more time fighting than implementing the necessary reforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">What should we do now? I am calling on the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to terminate this agreement of 14 October 2010 earlier than planned and not to leave it in place until the parliamentary elections. Of course dialogue remains important, but we should not artificially enhance the status of these people by means of an agreement of this kind. The EU should initiate a comprehensive communication strategy aimed directly at the population and at civil society in order to make it clear what our concerns are. At the same time, we should tell Mr Yanukovych what we expect of him and by when. We need to set clear limits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Füle, you should not be under the illusion that the good intentions that we have towards the country and its people in our agreement have been the driving force behind the actions of the ruling family. The reality is that the son of Mr Yanukovych, the rest of the family and its friends want to increase their personal wealth. The only question is whether the other oligarchs see this as a threat to their own interests. We should combine the carrot for the country with a stick for the family and the oligarchs for their dishonestly acquired wealth in the EU. We need to locate their assets and freeze them. I have read that Cyprus would be a good place to start looking for the accounts. I hope that we have the political will to do this.</p>

We have tools at our disposal – the association agreements and the European Neighbourhood Policy – to influence positive developments in the relevant countries.</p>

Ukraine is the country in which we have achieved the most progress – but then why is it that today, Ukraine seems further from EU values than ever? Just last weekend, the Gay Pride parade could not take place due to extremists.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should ensure that ‘more for more’ is put into practice. Respect for the rule of law and democratic values are priorities of the Association Agenda.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope no one here in the Chamber is in any doubt that Ukraine is geographically part of Europe. However, I think we do need to realise that the people of Ukraine feel they are a truly European society. Current public opinion polls show that over 70% of the people who live in Ukraine support Ukraine’s integration with the European Union. I think that in many of the European Union’s Member States, we can only dream of such a result. So of course, on the one hand, we must condemn the selective application of the law, the violations of human rights, the inhumane treatment of prisoners, the violations of and restrictions on freedom of speech and the persecution of business people just because they support opposition parties; and we must, of course, demand democratic, free and fair elections, in which we should, by the way, help by sending as many EU observers as possible. However, on the other hand, we must not shut the European door on Ukraine. We have to show them that the European Union is open to extensive cooperation with Ukraine – obviously, we must not punish Ukrainian society for the Soviet mentality of its authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to appeal to President Yanukovych. Mr Yanukovych, there are certain moments in history which are decisive in terms of how you will be remembered.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, all the hair-splitting that I have heard emanating from one side of the House does not help us to get at what I believe is the heart of the problem: that in Ukraine, justice is being used for political purposes, and Yulia Tymoshenko is suffering the consequences. The only alternative to this situation is for Yulia Tymoshenko to be freed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not believe that anything more needs to be said, given that any other sensible comments – of which I have heard several – risk casting a smokescreen over what is actually happening in that country. I believe the time has come for all of us to cooperate together, including the sporting authorities, for even if it is true that a boycott would not work, it is equally true that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the event organiser, in particular, must add its voice to the calls on the government in Kiev to release Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
      <p sl="it">For some years, UEFA has promoted its own campaign, called ‘Respect’, to combat discrimination in all its forms. I believe that ‘respect’ means respect for the truth that lies in every human heart, and therefore, in effect, the exercise of justice in the interest of the individual, whoever they may be.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why we must fight this battle together, because a strong Europe, one that demands truth, freedom and justice for Yulia Tymoshenko, is the Europe that we want and – I am quite sure – that Ukrainian citizens want, too.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law is particularly important in our neighbourhood – taken from Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union – and Ukraine is a neighbouring country to Europe, with which we have concluded negotiations on an association agreement, and one which has what we call ‘European prospects’. For that reason, therefore, there needs to be a strong demand for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am worried about the lack of political will from the Ukrainian authorities on this matter. This is emphasised with the case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and also other opposition leaders, victims of selective justice and a penal code from the Soviet era, as previously mentioned. It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month.</p>

However, I do not think that we should underestimate the significance of the fact that there are now just six weeks to go before these football championships. Now is the time that Ukraine could meet us halfway on matters of human rights. In the European Union, Mr Barroso, among others, has said that he may stay away from the games.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, let me begin by saying that Ukraine is European and has its place in Europe. The cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, such as the association agreement, for example, is also important to Ukraine and its European ambitions. In order to move closer to the EU and even one day to become part of it, other countries must have the same values as the EU. This applies to all countries which want a closer relationship with EU, including Ukraine, regardless of who is currently in power there.</p>
      <p sl="sv">One of the first things that becomes noticeable when a country’s values differ from those of the EU is that human rights and the rule of law do not function properly. In the case of Ukraine, we in the European Parliament have been concerned for some time about both of these issues. Most importantly, we believe that Ukraine does not make a distinction between political trials and judicial trials. Criminal acts should be punished because they are against the law, but there must be no more political trials.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If Ukraine is serious about moving closer to the EU, judicial trials must be transparent and comply with EU standards. Human rights must be respected and the media must be independent. Without these three things, there will be a more closed society in Ukraine and that is not the route which we want the country to take.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU and the European Parliament have always been clear about what we expect from our partners. It is now up to the people of Ukraine to call for the necessary changes. We cannot deviate from our values, but we can help Ukraine to transform into a modern democracy and we are prepared to do that.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Mr Füle, I wish to address those in power in Ukraine and tell them that we will not tire of insisting that honest, fair and democratic elections should be held where opposition parties and leaders can participate, including Ms Tymoshenko and the other politicians who are currently in prison, because Ukraine matters to us.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We have stated on numerous occasions our desire for Ukraine and the 45 million plus Ukrainians to have a European perspective. The obstacle preventing this is not Yulia Tymoshenko, but the family-type, oligarchic structure created in Ukraine in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. Unfortunately, this family oligarchy clearly has no desire to reform the country based on a European model. What is paramount for them is to preserve the financial channels for getting rich.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Ukraine is not the only example of this. The further east we go from Berlin, the more difficult the democratic transition is.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We have heard verbal assurances many times from those in power that they will find a solution to the Tymoshenko case and those involving the other opposition leaders. I was at the conference in Yalta last September where President Yanukovych declared in front of Carl Bildt and other colleagues of mine that there would be a positive development in Ms Tymoshenko’s situation by the end of 2011. Not only has this not happened, but we are seeing the situation evolve precisely in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We have not called for a boycott of the European Football Championships as a sporting event. On the contrary, I am calling for this opportunity to be used to encourage the reforms in the country and confirm the European perspective ahead of Ukraine. However, this event must not be used in any way by the Ukrainian ruling group for self-promotion, which must be guaranteed by those European politicians who are considering going to Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on Saturday, I had the opportunity to talk to Yulia Tymoshenko in hospital in Kharkiv, where she is now serving her sentence. I would like to thank the Ukrainian authorities for agreeing to this meeting and for making the appropriate preparations for us to have over an hour and a half of in-depth conversation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I will start with information about her health. It was indeed sad to see such an active, hard-working and dynamic person confined to her bed, unable to move and visibly suffering. Nonetheless, we had a very interesting conversation about many things, including, Commissioner Füle, Mr Schulz’s initiative to send a last-chance mission – to find a respected politician in Europe who will go and look once again at the matter of the charging and conviction of Ms Tymoshenko and who will attend the final phase of her trial, the cassation appeal. Following this conversation, I have the impression that there is initial consent from Ms Tymoshenko about this on one condition: that it is someone who is impartial, not involved in the matter in any way and independent in their opinions, and that the choice should also be consulted with the opposition in Ukraine, not just with the authorities, and I would like to appeal for this to be done.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the Ukrainian Government must be sent a very strong warning. I agree with the position of the European Commission and of those European leaders who refuse to sign the association agreement and to meet with the leaders of the Yanukovych regime.</p>
      <p sl="hu">That said, some form of dialogue must be maintained. It is obvious that the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko is a politically motivated show trial, which is unacceptable. Ms Tymoshenko must be released as soon as possible, although I must add that she is not a Joan of Arc and neither is she innocent as a lamb; still, this show trial is unacceptable. Every speaker mentioned that the rule of law must be restored in Ukraine. I agree that we do not have much time to put pressure on the Yanukovych Government.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In this debate, I would like to bring up another aspect of the lack of the rule of law: it is extremely unsettling that despite requests from the Council of Europe, several MEPs and the leaders of the minorities concerned, the Ukrainian authorities failed to take minorities into consideration when delineating electoral districts for the parliamentary elections. Some years ago, Ukraine still managed to work this out in Subcarpathia, but this time there was a lack of political will on the part of the current Ukrainian leadership.</p>

      <p sl="sl">It is obvious that the political culture in the transition countries in and around Europe is very low. It is becoming a common occurrence to prosecute former members of government, to lock them up, and to accuse current and former politicians of corruption.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I had expected that Ms Tymoshenko’s daughter, whom we received so spectacularly, would have been interested in our views on Ukraine and the imprisonment of her mother. Unfortunately, she left the balcony shortly after her formal reception and it is clear that she does not seem to show a great deal of interest in our opinions. Let me get to the point. Objectively, it must be recognised that the continued detention of the former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, is exacerbating the political climate in Ukraine. From my position, I would not dare to judge the level of Ms Tymoshenko's responsibility for the economic failure in the administration of the country or the murder of its political opponents. I agree that every citizen, including Yulia Tymoshenko, has the right to a fair trial. Ukraine is one of the European Union’s most important neighbours, and therefore an interest on the part of the EU in the functioning of its political and judicial system is understandable. Our involvement in addressing the political disputes between the democratically-elected government and opposition political forces should not lead to an even greater polarisation of the political scene in Ukraine. On the contrary; a civilised, factual, open and impersonal dialogue between all relevant political forces in Ukraine should be our main objective for Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I must say that I am very disappointed that we are basing the negotiations and relationships we have with Ukraine around the person of Yulia Tymoshenko. I am disappointed because when we talk about the situation in Ukraine, we should be talking about it in all contexts, not associating it with one person. What is more, until recently, this person was the country’s prime minister and she had the opportunity to take all the measures for which we are now reproaching the current Ukrainian Government. This is not to say that in Ukraine, all is well and that Ukraine cannot cope with the substantive criticism. This criticism should, in any case, be substantive and universal, and should focus on measures that are to the benefit of all citizens and not only in favour of the imprisoned prime minister. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to add one more thing. I very much hope that Ukraine will take steps towards the creation of the best possible relations with the European Union. In fact, though, it would be inappropriate for us to criticise the fact that their prime minister has been indicted and will subsequently be tried for her poor management of state assets, because if similar measures were in place in our Member States, our citizens would welcome it if our politicians were convicted for similar handling of state assets.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate shows that the European Parliament and the Union as a whole recognise the importance of Ukraine as our partner, but as a partner which can be relied upon to maintain certain standards. We are not indifferent to Ukraine, we want Ukraine to be a fully-fledged partner in Europe, but we want it to be a partner which inspires respect, upholds human rights and is ruled by law. The imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and other opposition figures means the current President and government of Ukraine have not chosen this European route. Changes to the justice system, improvements on human rights, introducing local government, and all of this together with free and fair elections – this is the way for Ukraine to confirm that it is heading for European integration.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, let us give an important signal to the citizens of Ukraine, here, from the European Parliament, that firstly we are not talking about a boycott of Euro 2012, but that in return, we do expect the release of oppositionists being held in prison and we do expect free and fair elections.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr Azarov, has offered to allow international officials to monitor the next trial of Ms Tymoshenko. This is another farce in what has become a classic example of managed democracy. I believe that we do not need these monitors. We should just read the four reports by the experienced former Danish prosecutor, Mr Lyngbo, who has followed and evaluated all the trials and who concludes that this is clearly politically motivated justice. There is no proof of the fraudulent exercise of public office, of abuse of positions or of corruption.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to do something about corruption in Ukraine, we should look at the terms under which the contracts for the European Championship stadiums were awarded. These cost one-third more than they should have done. The important point is that the money made its way into private pockets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one comment about what Mr Lambsdorff said. You criticised the debate here and expressed the naïve hope that there would be free and fair elections in Ukraine.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think that more than ever, we should be interested in cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, because we have already decided we are going to be saying ‘no’ to Turkey for a long time to come. In Serbia, elections have been won by parties and groups which are anti-European and opposed to Europe. The regime in Belarus has not relaxed its grip at all, but continues instead to bolster its position, nor are we dealing with a process of democratisation in Putin’s Russia at the moment, but with another case of tightening the reins. It seems to me that we should be very concerned about this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, if we look at what is going on in Ukraine, I have the feeling that anti-European forces are getting stronger there too, although society in general is in favour of Europe. The First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Renat Kuzmin, visited us here in Parliament, and we talked about the situation of Yulia Tymoshenko. We said it is imperative she be released immediately on health grounds. All we heard in reply was that there are going to be further trials, this time in connection with suspicions that Members of the Ukrainian Parliament have been murdered. This is not a sign that Ukraine wants to cooperate with those who want Ukraine in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, today’s discussion is not just a discussion about the Yulia Tymoshenko situation. It is also about the principles upon which institutions and democracy function in Ukraine, and it is also about which principles the EU wishes to apply in order to implement its policy towards neighbouring and partner countries. Yulia Tymoshenko is an example of a political process that would not arise at all under normal circumstances. Political and criminal responsibility should be clearly separated in each country that is committed to democratic values. Government institutions in Ukraine should guarantee the independence and transparency of all judicial processes and should not selectively apply justice against political opponents. In Ukraine the political struggle should take place within a free and fair election campaign, and not by imprisoning political opponents. It is not possible to call a political game in which the opposition is in prison a fair one, just as it is not fair to play a football match against a team that is sitting in the changing room.</p>

That she is now languishing in prison is something which is not acceptable, and while she may have issues to address, they should be done so in accordance with the normal judicial norms and that is what we should work towards. It is not acceptable that she is being treated as she is as of now.</p>
      <p sl="ga">As regards a boycott of the Championships, I do not like mixing sport and politics, and while we may discuss it, I would hope that it will not come to that. It should be an option of last resort but, hopefully, our discussions might lead to some resolution prior to that.</p>

My perception of Yulia Tymoshenko and her struggle for a fair trial is similar to that of the Slovene writer Prežihov Voranc in ‘Samorastniki’ (‘Self-made Men’).

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the honourable Members and yourself are all right. You are all right. The situation that we are facing is very complex.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind you of the bigger picture. We are talking about the transformation and transition of a country of 50 million people, we are talking about the transformation of eastern Europe and we are talking about a country, a region, where, not a long time ago – and we all here remember this – a totalitarian regime reigned, the Soviet totalitarian regime to be more precise.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not the first region where the European Union has tried to transform and expand the values of democracy and legality. There are others – central Europe, the western Balkans – where, through the policy of enlargement and by using those countries’ vision of sooner or later joining the European Union, this organisation has been successful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have no illusions about Ukraine and that part of Europe. I have a vision that sooner or later, we will be able to be bold with regard to this region and this country and that we will help in the transformation there. Now, in that transformation, there has been a discussion about geopolitics being on one side and values on the other side. I do not see a contradiction. I think we need to be aware of geopolitics, but we should not play geopolitics. I think we should do everything possible to help Ukraine to transform and that this is in line with the legitimate aspirations of the people. We should be flexible, innovative and creative. We should not see the situation as being black and white.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, there is one thing on which we should never compromise. We should never compromise on our values and our principles because, if we do and if we make these compromises, sooner or later, we will face more than challenges – problems – in our own neighbourhood, if not within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">That was my first point. My second point concerns boycotting the football championship. In the Commission and the Council, we have never used the word ‘boycott’. Let me therefore reiterate the position on Euro 2012. As matters now stand, President Barroso has no intention of travelling to the Ukraine or of attending Euro 2012 events in Ukraine. This position is shared by the College, bearing in mind that Commissioners would have been attending in a personal rather than a professional capacity. It is not a boycott and we hope that Euro 2012 will be a great success. This does not affect the matches in Poland, of course. And yes, the Commission is in favour of the fair play which is so closely associated with sport also being associated with politics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning now to the important question about the elections – free and fair elections. The Member States are agreed on the importance of sending as many European Union election observers as possible as part of the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission. The European Union delegation in Kiev has already started coordinating actions with the European Union Heads of Missions with a view to supporting training of observers or financing exit polls, which played an essential role in the evaluation of previous elections, particularly those in 2004. A European Union delegation has also observed all the relevant meetings of the Central Election Commission. Also in the pipeline are projects in support of media monitoring, analysis of marketing of parties and so on with the Council of Europe – all the projects to reach out to vulnerable voters. That was my third point.</p>
      <p sl="en">My fourth point – to a more interested group of parliamentarians – is that, for my part, I care about former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko as a person and I care about her as a politician.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a person, together with you, I will do my best firstly to ensure that she has access to medical care she feels comfortable with and that treatment begins to address the cause of her illness. Next, I will do everything possible, together with you, to ensure that we have access to her and that she has access to her family and to her lawyers. I will also make sure, together with you, that the Court of Cassation will offer a different picture of justice and the rule of law in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also care about her as a politician and my motto here is that, whatever the political responsibility – and there were many she had to deal with when she was Prime Minister – whenever we are talking about political responsibility, the right arena is not a court or prison but an open arena and elections. Whenever there is the possibility of criminal responsibility, or talk of criminal responsibility, beyond any doubt, all preconditions need to be in place for the rule of law to deliver and for there to be a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a fifth and last remark. Yulia Tymoshenko herself has asked that her case should not be used as an excuse to slow the association process. We respect that. At the same time, we demand that Ukraine show that it respects the spirit of our new agreement before we can confidently open the way to allow its entry into force.</p>

All arguments by supporters of Yulia Tymoshenko and supporters of strict diktats towards the current government of Ukraine resemble hysteria more than debates. We should be guided only by facts and not engage in political advertising of Yulia Tymoshenko, who lost the elections. I am sure that, if the court reached a verdict that Ms Tymoshenko is guilty, she should be subjected to punishment accordingly. I am sure that efforts to put the former prime minister beyond the law represent interference in the domestic affairs of Ukraine. I am sure that the political struggle should not become a clown-style activity. 48 million Ukrainian citizens are waiting for change but instead, they see every day the Yulia Tymoshenko soap opera. I will vote against the resolution and all other texts on Ukraine if they contain silly points and emotions.

A year ago, on 9 June 2011, we were already sounding an alarm bell about the selective nature of the judicial inquiries being conducted into the former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, and some of the members of the government that she led. Unfortunately, we are obliged to return to this topic and call once again on the Ukrainian authorities to demonstrate transparency and impartiality in the proceedings against Yulia Tymoshenko. As a member of the Council of Europe, Ukraine must comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The European Parliament has expressed its support on countless occasions for Ukraine’s integration into Europe. Achieving such a goal requires more than the Ukrainian people wanting integration. Political leaders in Kiev also need to act in a manner appropriate under the rule of law. I firmly believe that if Ukrainian politicians demonstrate political will, they will succeed in having the association agreement with the European Union adopted, which we would all like to see implemented.</p>

By involving itself in the assessment of Ms Tymoshenko’s case, the Parliament illegally acts as a court of appeal driven by a political rationale. Many of those who insist on sanctioning Ukraine have a hidden agenda unrelated to the human rights. They desire to stop the EU’s future enlargement by stopping Ukraine’s further EU integration. Likewise, these people want to freeze the grey international status quo of Ukraine by dividing its political operators into pro-Russians, left under Russian control, and pro-Europeans misled by empty promises. Special trade arrangements guaranteed by supporting certain political players in Ukraine could also be the motivation behind this approach. These do not reflect the European interest but some Member States’ interests or, at worst, those of some private groups. The European Parliament should reject such hidden agendas, while acknowledging that the EU is not strong enough to impose its wishes on Ukraine and that this country has other geopolitical alternatives than EU integration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Ukraine claims that the trial and imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko is all about the fight against corruption, yet apart from jailing the former Prime Minister, the government in Kiev has failed to show its reformist colours, especially when it comes to tackling corruption. According to the Heritage Foundation’s 2012 Index, Ukraine’s economic freedom is the worst in Europe. Entrepreneurism is stifled by widespread corruption, with trade barriers and an unfriendly investment climate undermining economic growth. President Yanukovych has said that the current ‘pause’ in EU-Ukraine relations may actually benefit the two sides. I hope that Yanukovych uses this pause to reflect on whether detaining Tymoshenko is the best way of addressing corruption in his dysfunctional country. He needs to take a long hard look at the independence of the Ukrainian courts. He needs to ask himself whether a corrupt judiciary coupled with the incarceration of the leader of the opposition is the right way to fulfil the promise he made in 2010 for a Ukraine which was ‘a free state, where rights and freedoms are the highest values’. I hope that after hitting the ‘pause’ button, Yanukovych doesn’t choose to rewind. Otherwise, the EU will have to press ‘stop’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Secondly, in order to guarantee a coherent final adopted text, I would like to propose the following: if Amendment 5 is adopted but without part 3, I propose that we vote on part 3 of Amendment 1 and, if necessary, on part 3 of Amendment 3; then again, if Amendment 1 is adopted but without part 3, I propose that we vote on part 3 of Amendment 3. I hope you could follow all that! Thank you very much for your support. And, of course, I will ask for electronic votes on split vote part 3 of Amendment 5 and, if needed, on split vote part 3 of Amendment 1 and of Amendment 3.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon confirmed that security is a prerequisite for ensuring the exercise of fundamental rights and creating an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Treaty of Lisbon has thus strongly anchored EU security policy to a specific rule of law. This internal security strategy is a response to the call made within the Stockholm Programme. In order to put in place an effective internal security system, a comprehensive EU analysis of the threats to be addressed must be carried out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There has been agreement on five priority areas in which the EU can provide added value. However, I would like to point out that even though man-made disasters were not included in the key priorities in the end, they are no less important. Man-made disasters can easily represent a direct, serious and collective threat to the security of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome suggestions to strengthen the EU’s internal security strategy in relation to combating the rising threats of terrorism and cross-border crime and those relating to natural and man-made disasters. In these instances, it would be logical for the EU to formulate a coherent unified strategy, rather than have individual Member States trying to tackle such threats alone. I also welcome proposals to strengthen the links with international organisations, such as NATO, and to encourage Member States to communicate their security strategies.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the report refers to many initiatives outlined in the Stockholm Programme concerning justice and home affairs, which I do not support. It refers to the creation of a European legal culture in the field of criminal law, and touches on the development of a European policy on asylum and immigration. These are Member State competences and should remain so.</p>

      <p sl="it">Ms Borsellino’s report sets out the five key areas in which concrete action has been proposed, and it calls for greater judicial and police cooperation between Member States to combat organised crime and terrorism.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, this report is a fantastic example of blinkered policy. The fact is that, as such, the report reels off a list of the serious problems that we have with international crime in the EU – the mafia, the trafficking of women, drugs trafficking, arms smuggling, and so on – but says not one word about what everyone outside these walls is talking about, which is border controls. The most disastrous thing, perhaps the most disastrous decision that the EU has made over the last number of years, was to prohibit Member States from controlling their own borders.</p>
      <p sl="da">We do indeed have a free internal market for goods and capital, services, and so on, but our citizens were never asked whether they also wanted an internal market in international crime. I find it striking that, at a time when Germany is carrying out checks on its border with Poland, when the whole of the French presidential elections hinged on border controls, when Sweden has border controls, when, last year, Commission representatives descended on Denmark because we wanted to have border controls, that at such a time, Parliament is capable of adopting a report on international crime that contains not one word about this.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategy, launched under the Spanish Presidency, involves action on five major fronts: the fight against organised crime; the fight against terrorism; the fight against cybercrime; border security; and natural disasters.

      <p sl="it">I believe that the work of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) – and that of the rapporteur, Ms Borsellino – is highly important. In my view, it is vital that these five comprehensive points be further developed as regards the implementation of the integrated security policy approach, cooperation between the different operational levels and, above all, the exchange of information.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for her work. According to Eurobarometer, 40% of Europeans would like the European Union to equip itself with better tools for combating organised crime and terrorism. In the current economic crisis, however, there is a risk that the resources available to fight these threats may be eroded.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are very many matters in this report with which I am in agreement. I have always been a supporter of strengthening ties between the European Union and international institutions such as NATO, and of establishing a common strategy for fighting organised crime and carrying on a common fight against terrorism. It is obvious to me, too, that very many of the threats we face today in the field of security are almost exclusively threats of a transnational nature, both within the European Union and also outside its borders. Therefore – in my opinion – it is important for the Member States to be ready to cooperate in this area, and the cooperation should be made as extensive as possible. Unfortunately, I am also a supporter of upholding the sovereignty of nation states, including within the European Union – particularly in such a sensitive area as security – so this was a difficult decision, but I abstained from the vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategies are undoubtedly a fundamental reference point for protecting citizens. It is equally clear, however, that if this section is not allocated sufficient resources to enable these important objectives to be enacted, then security will remain – as it has thus far – a possible but somewhat indefinite option.</p>
      <p sl="it">Recent events show that security must be guaranteed not only through significant resource allocations but also through strong cooperation based on trust between Member States. The fight against organised crime and terrorism requires strong solidarity between Member States, safeguards for the licit economy, and robust law enforcement against all transnational threats. This demands a prevention-based approach, including border protection and effective enforcement measures to combat organised crime, mafias and terrorism. It is a challenge which, together, we can win.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the first remark to be made about this own-initiative report on the European Union’s internal security strategy is that it is a very important report because, however much we may regret the fact, the European internal market creates new opportunities for crime. Unfortunately, criminals are also showing that they can be innovative. It does not matter whether we are talking about serious organised crime, terrorism or cybercrime. We need a common strategy to combat these problems within the European internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is important that we have a clear division of responsibilities between the European Union and the Member States and, on the other hand, that they begin to network with one another. I do not want us to give up on this because we need better networking between the Member States in day-to-day life, so that data can be compared and crime combated more quickly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Therefore, concrete action must be taken by the relevant bodies in order not only to fight against these threats but also to prevent them.

      <p sl="ro">In this context, cooperation between the European Union, NATO and the OSCE becomes relevant. Cross-border organised crime is not only an issue affecting Europe, and it cannot be tackled and eliminated in a coherent, efficient manner without having a common instrument in this area. I believe that the current crisis must not pose an obstacle to creating this instrument, but quite the opposite.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report recognises that criminal law is a highly sensitive policy area, and many Member States feel that their own individual criminal justice systems should continue to serve them best. This is particularly relevant for my Member State, the UK, where the criminal justice system dates back nearly 140 years. It is much more experienced, and thus better equipped, to tackle crime in the UK and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report acknowledges that an EU policy in criminal law would not necessarily be more cost-effective, nor would it result in a reduction in crime. Indeed, it asserts that, instead of harmonising criminal law across the EU, it may be more prudent to improve mutual recognition. I was not able to support the report in its current form, as Member States are best placed to coordinate activity directed at combating crime.</p>

      <p sl="it">Although the mutual recognition of the harmonisation of legislation protecting the principle of the presumption of innocence is important, it is worth emphasising that legislation has to be clear-cut and easily understandable so that it becomes clear to all whether acts amount to criminal offences or not. This especially holds true for directives, since these have to be transposed into national law. Indeed, any lack of clarity could give rise to diverging interpretations of the law.</p>

That came to mind when I read this report, which talks in grandiose terms about the common culture of criminal law that characterises the EU’s Member States, about the fantastic positive aspects of mutual recognition, and so on. Extolling these two facts must undoubtedly be an expression of a very particular European ideology, because out in the real world, the problems involving differences between the criminal law systems of the 27 Member States are massive, and there has been no attempt to reconcile the rules of the different countries to eliminate these problems – rather the contrary. Looking at what has happened in connection with the European arrest warrant, at what happened after joint legislation on terrorism was introduced and so on, it is clear that there are huge problems and, in view of these, we should not be lauding and opening up the way for a common European system of criminal law, but should instead be sending out a call to arms and going in the opposite direction. That is why I voted against this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The procedures and criminal codes in use in the European Union’s 27 Member States reflect differences between them, and there is nothing wrong with this. These differences find their origins in the different cultural, historical and practical contexts of what are, after all, the different countries which make up our Union. So I think that on this very difficult matter, which also involves serious ideological conflicts – because certain things are legal in some countries but not in others – we should respect these sensitivities, leave this matter to the Member States and concentrate on improving cooperation in the field of security under current procedures.</p>

As an MEP from a new Member State, I want to change my domestic judicial system for the better, and it is in my interest to look at judicial systems which work better and are long-established and proven over hundreds of years, so that is why I am voting for EU-level cooperation, through which best practices can be imported into the new Member States.</p>

Nevertheless, I cannot back a report that advocates a unified approach to criminal law across the Member States, as I am convinced that each individual Member State should be competent to deal with these matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I reject ‘Corpus Juris’. Our individual systems of criminal law and proceedings have evolved over many years, and each Member State has its own crime patterns and a legal culture specific to itself.

This is true; in reality, however, things are more complicated and all of us can be vulnerable consumers at one time or another, especially given the advent of new, extremely aggressive selling practices. I am referring, in particular, to the whole area of e-commerce, behavioural advertising, etc. A legal instrument was therefore needed and, in my opinion, it is to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, while this instrument certainly needed to assert the rights of vulnerable consumers, it also needed to provide them with the means of enforcing them. I think this is the other major advance that this instrument represents, and we should all welcome this step forward by Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the report on strengthening the rights of vulnerable consumers as it will give those consumers an added degree of protection when purchasing goods and products across the EU. The proposals put forward in the report are balanced and sensible, particularly in relation to misleading advertising, unfair contract terms and unfair business practices. These measures would also go some way to ensuring that the current differences which exist between products of the same brand in different Member States are eliminated – a problem which many of my Welsh constituents encounter daily.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to ensure that all consumers are confident enough when buying products and are protected, by requiring Member States to monitor information which is given to the public and to ensure that the information can be easily understood by all.</p>

This was, of course, a signal that there would be consequences if he proposed a law that proved to be fatal. Fortunately, such practices are now behind us, but I cannot help thinking of it when I read this report dealing with consumer rights. Of course it is nice to secure certain privileged rights for certain vulnerable groups of consumers. On the other hand, one cannot help thinking that had the EU not insisted so zealously and so intensely on total harmonisation in the area of consumer rights, the rules would never have sunk to the level that they are at today. The fact is that Member State after Member State has been forced to create generally poorer rules for consumers, and we are now in a situation in which the EU has to make special rules for vulnerable consumers. Would it not have been better to have simply applied a minimum of harmonisation and left the countries alone to stick with their good rules?</p>

Consumers may be vulnerable for various reasons, and potentially anyone may be affected.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why this group of consumers, along with consumers in general, needs to be protected. A targeted strategy is required that considers the problem in the round while, on the one hand, avoiding creating new forms of discrimination and, on the other, eschewing static, rigid definitions that are unable to embrace all the facets of the matter and the various possible kinds of vulnerability. Specific, targeted protective measures are therefore needed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">However, I would like to talk about an aspect of this issue which for me, as a father of two daughters, is of particular importance – advertising aimed at children, who today are already precisely this kind of vulnerable consumer. This advertising is not only aimed at people who are still young and immature and can easily be manipulated, but unfortunately it also teaches them a very materialistic approach to life. It teaches them that their value is not measured by their achievements at school, but by what toys they have or what clothes they wear. I am a supporter of free speech, and I am also a supporter of freedom for advertising, but I think that if advertising is aimed at adults, it is something completely different than if it is aimed at children and adolescents.</p>

Every consumer can then be certain, regardless of what he buys, that it is equally safe and of the same quality in every Member State.

We must make sure that advertising, particularly in the case of vulnerable consumers, does not move in the wrong direction and become misleading.</p>

The report stresses the importance of understanding what it is that makes the consumer vulnerable and picks up on the fact that vulnerability can come from external factors – for instance, I myself was a victim of consumer credit fraud even though I am not vulnerable and I realise that there is very little come-back under our system against this – as well as from those that are inherent in the consumer’s physical and mental situation, and therefore proposes measures for the problems of vulnerability to be addressed on a case-by-case basis rather than a ‘one size fits all’ solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I backed the report’s assertion that consumers’ ability to make the best decision by themselves is optimised in a situation in which they have access to all adequate information which is both comprehensible and easily accessible.

Until now, I thought that it was sufficient for consumers to have enough information and access to justice if the fundamental principles of a business relationship are violated. However, in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur leads us to believe that consumers either do not understand, are not pushy, or they are unable to complain. They are vulnerable and we need to take care of them. The rapporteur is correct in one respect: Some people really are more vulnerable, such as elderly people or children. Their vulnerability is due to the weakening of family and neighbourhood values. They need intergenerational solidarity, and not officials who do their shopping for them. I support the report, but the problem of vulnerable citizens needs to be addressed in a wider context, because otherwise, it will only get worse and not even European legislation will be of any help.</p>

This means that what was intended to ensure that everyone played by the same rules has, in fact, created 27 different standards. That is quite simply unacceptable. We have 85 directives that have now been adopted by the EU’s institutions and should be applicable law, but which have not yet been implemented in one or more Member States. It means that enterprises in the countries that are good at implementing the rules swiftly, effectively and in a timely manner are placed in a poorer position relative to those in countries that just let it all drift.

Viewed in these terms, this report bears witness to the fact that not only are there many problems, including in the civil sphere, but that the problems are increasing.

Statistics show that two to three women are killed every day by a husband, family member or former husband. We cannot allow such widespread violations of human rights in Turkey. Honour killings, forced marriages, marriages concluded at an early age and domestic violence are areas still lacking legislation to punish the guilty and protect victims.</p>

We know from experience that the mere implementation of a zero tolerance policy is not enough to achieve the objective.

I would like here to say something about so-called ‘honour’ suicides, to which reference has already been made. We are entitled to expect that not only will the Turkish Government adopt a clear position on this matter, because it has already taken such a position, but that it will very consistently strive for the elimination of this horrific phenomenon from Turkish society.

This is, for me, a rare occurrence, as so often these reports get bogged down in dogmatic political posturing and important issues are often lost in pointless rhetoric, but in this report we have some clear points being made, both in identifying Turkey’s progress and in detailing where more work needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the tone of the report, which is neither hectoring nor lecturing, and identifies this as clearly a work in progress. I particularly welcome progress in Turkey in the areas of health and education for women and children. The appointment of a Minister for Family and Social Policies is a good sign, and I have been very impressed by her strong public assurances that the Turkish Government is continuing to escalate the issue of women’s rights up its agenda. Of course there is a long way to go, but we should be encouraging the Turkish Government to continue on this trajectory.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that the European Union should use its influence to support the cause of women in Turkey and promote women’s rights in accordance with the Charter of European Rights. Turkey is the largest country seeking membership in the Union; this is both an opportunity and a challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accession process is valuable in itself and we must assist accession countries in implementing laws which are consistent with our principles and values, although I have to say that there are Member States where few women are in politics and in high level decision-making positions, so we also have to work in our own Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming back to Turkey, women are active members of their communities and must be involved in the decision-making process in all areas. Increased political participation for approximately half of the Turkish population will only increase the country’s wealth and its democratic credentials. I welcome this report and endorse its recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="it">The establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities within the Turkish Parliament and the Gender Equality Commission within the Ministry of Education represent a step forward. The recognition of Turkish women’s rights must be an essential part of the negotiations for accession to the European Union.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Bozkurt report on the 2020 perspective for women in Turkey. It is true that Turkey has made progress recently in the field of women’s rights. I particularly welcome the appointment last year of Fatma Sahin as the new Minister for Family and Social Policies and the work that she has already done to underline the importance of women’s rights as issues for her government to take seriously. The establishment of a new Bureau on domestic violence, responsible for arresting perpetrators and protecting victims, is, I believe, an extremely positive step.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is still room for improvement. I feel that the Turkish Government could take further action in order to prevent early forced marriages, as well as taking more action on the more recent issues of honour suicides or honour killings. But, overall, I do believe that this report takes all these matters into account satisfactorily so I voted in favour of it.</p>

I believe that this is also why our failure in very many cases to resolve issues and achieve things is due to the structure of Turkey’s model.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is more important, as I see it, is for us to combat violence against women in Turkey. I welcome the measures implemented by the Turkish Government at an institutional level. However, I think that sustained efforts need to be made at the moment so that these measures can somehow be put into practice. It is unacceptable for us to continue to tolerate these ‘honour’ suicides and ‘honour’ crimes which, in my view, are a heinous act in the 21st century. However, there are issues which could be levelled at our Member States, too. It is difficult to introduce gender tolerance in a country like Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="nl">It is important that we, as the European Parliament, stand up for the rights of women, both in Europe and beyond, and thus also in an Asian and Islamic country such as Turkey, where so-called ‘honour killings’ take place and where forced marriages are commonplace. It is good that this report makes reference to this, albeit somewhat reluctantly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why, in fact, are we not speaking clearly about the increasing Islamification of society in Turkey? We are talking about a deep cultural groundswell that cannot just be tackled or counteracted through legislative initiatives.

However, in order to ensure that such coins only make up a small proportion of all euro coins in circulation, a certain limit on the number of commemorative circulation coins needs to be set. Reducing the number of commemorative coins in circulation would simplify administrative procedures, such as procedures to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Given the scale of their payment services, credit institutions and other providers of payment services, as well as all other institutions involved in handling and distributing banknotes and coins, have an obligation to ensure the authenticity of euro banknotes and coins which they receive and intend to put back into circulation and to recognise counterfeit money.

As they circulate throughout the euro area, their national design features are a matter of common interest. They have a common European side and a distinctive national side. The common European sides of the coins bear both the name of the single currency and the denomination of the coin. A clear indication of the name of the issuing Member State should be put on the national side of the euro coin in order to allow interested coin users to easily identify the issuing Member State. The designs on the national sides of the euro coins are decided by each participating Member State. Issuing Member States should inform one another about new national sides well in advance of the planned issue date. To this end, issuing Member States should forward their draft euro coin designs to the Commission, which will verify their compliance with this regulation.

The lack of mandatory provisions for the issuance of euro coins may result in different practices among Member States and does not achieve a sufficiently integrated framework for the single currency. In the interests of legal transparency and certainty, the Commission therefore deems it necessary to introduce common binding rules on the basis of Article 133 for the issuance of euro coins. The Commission’s legislative proposal aims, in particular, at establishing specific provisions for commemorative euro coins so as to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the total number of two-euro coins in circulation. At the same time, these limits on volume should allow for the issuance of a sufficient volume of coins to ensure that commemorative coins can circulate effectively. It also aims to establish specific provisions for euro collector coins, which are not intended for circulation and which should be readily distinguishable from euro circulation coins. Euro collector coins should have legal tender status only in their Member State of issuance and should not be issued with a view to their entry into circulation. In addition, euro collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank (ECB), but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because neither the Member States nor the Commission have as yet envisaged any role for Parliament in this process, despite the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. In the European Union, the Treaty of Lisbon has further consolidated the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights and the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States. EU security policy is strongly anchored to a specific EU rule of law, so the reinforcement of this policy must be based on democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The key common threats identified in the internal security strategy – organised crime, terrorism and radicalisation, cybercrime, corruption and challenges to border management – have interlinked external and internal dimensions. The Stockholm Programme emphasised that an EU internal security strategy should be developed in order to further improve security throughout the Union and effectively combat organised crime, terrorism and other threats, while respecting fundamental rights, the principles of international protection and the rule of law. Coordinated and coherent action in both areas is required for any response to be effective.</p>

One important objective is to prevent terrorism and combat the radicalisation and recruitment of Islamist militants.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This should be achieved by drafting a policy for extracting and analysing financial messaging data within the EU, the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (EU TFTP) (2011), setting up a joint European network for raising public awareness about radicalisation, as well as by adopting measures to combat violent extremist propaganda (2011) and consolidating EU transport security policy (2011).

Coordination of the internal and external dimensions of EU security strategy should encompass close and effective links between services, bodies and regional and thematic departments in a transversal way, and between the relevant services of the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) in order to ensure its effectiveness and coherence with the CFSP. High Representative Ashton should ensure coordination between the relevant Commission and EEAS units with a view to avoiding the unnecessary duplication of work and roles, especially in areas directly related to security issues inside and outside the EU. In this context, I welcome the proposal to establish a framework programme for research and innovation (2014-2020) under the title of Horizon 2020, which should integrate civilian and military capabilities in tasks ranging from civil protection to humanitarian relief, border management and peace-keeping.

However, the report is based on the Stockholm Programme and the strategic presence, via the CFSP, of EU forces in neighbouring countries and the rest of the world and, as such, is largely a move in the wrong direction. The report proposes increasing spending on security, interlinking the external and internal dimensions of security and forging a stronger link between EU external policy and organisations such as NATO. Finally, the report refers vaguely to extremist organisations, to the ‘importance of actions directed at countering violent radicalisation in vulnerable populations’ and ‘looks forward to the future work of the EU Radicalisation Awareness Network, with its mission of facilitating knowledge-sharing’. If and inasmuch as the report is alluding with this phraseology to poor sections of society, then its objective is to criminalise their expression and reaction. We also note that political forces on the left are systematically being labelled extremist. However, these issues are addressed by social policies, through education and through a fair distribution of wealth and social equality, not through policing, repression and informants.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The new situation as regards crime is characterised by the existence of extremely mobile and flexible criminal networks active in various jurisdictions and types of crime, supported by new technological trends and the widespread use of the Internet. The EU should be prepared to react appropriately as security threats emerge and evolve, with Parliament involved in setting the political course, and in implementing and evaluating the results. More than ever, there is a huge need for cooperation between Member States to face up to these challenges effectively. Five priorities have been identified for the next five years: combating organised crime, terrorism and cybercrime, and strengthening border management and the EU’s capacity to resist crises and disasters. It is important not just to strengthen the instruments available to the EU for combating crime, but also to implement and apply those that already exist: for example, the Member States still have not fully applied information exchange instruments, and not all the Member States have ratified and applied the various instruments for police and judicial cooperation. Better exchange of information between Europol and Eurojust would also contribute to preventing and suppressing criminal and terrorist activities, etc.</p>

I believe, however, that it is essential to emphasise that such common action must be taken in parallel with, and not instead of, national measures, which, by the principle of subsidiarity, must still represent the first level of action. In congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Borsellino, for her skill and dedication in preparing the report, I also take the opportunity to remember Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, two icons in the struggle against organised crime, who were killed in the space of a few months exactly 20 years ago.

It takes the view that EU security policy must be anchored to a specific EU rule of law, subject to oversight at European level. That is the starting point for developing an ‘EU internal security strategy’ that protects the EU from ‘terrorism and other threats’. Against the current backdrop, many of the possible implications of this vision are clear. This is all the truer when we consider that ‘all security policy must include a prevention component, which is particularly essential in a period in which economic and social inequalities are growing’. It continues, however, by suggesting soon afterwards that ‘EU security measures (…) have to (…) focus on targeted law enforcement and intelligence activities with proven capacity to lower crime rates and prevent terrorist attacks’. Despite a few assertions on human rights and the principle of subsidiarity, the entire report is along the lines of a drift towards security and repression that does not help to tackle effectively the causes of terrorism.

To regain this trust, a broader synergy must be created between social and institutional agents to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights. It is no longer useful to examine social phenomena in a local context; we now need to look beyond national boundaries.

The protection of the lives and safety of EU citizens is paramount. Security in the European Union must continue to be strengthened through effective measures to combat serious and organised crime, terrorism, radicalism and extremism, cybercrime and other threats. I consider it essential to strengthen the management of the external borders and increase resilience to natural disasters as well as to man-made disasters. All security measures must also be in accordance with the obligations of the EU in the field of fundamental rights and they must be focused on targeted enforcement of the law; it is essential to prove their ability to reduce crime rates and prevent terrorist attacks. It is also particularly important to create prevention mechanisms and mechanisms that enable us to detect signs of threats with sufficient advance notice. The recent Arab Spring events provide evidence that the Union’s internal security is inextricably linked to the security situation in countries that are located in its neighbourhood.

At the same time, concrete measures must be adopted to promote democracy, peace and stability in the countries neighbouring the European Union, thereby facilitating the creation of a common area of stability, security and progress.

In any case, I consider freedom, security and justice to be objectives that must be pursued in parallel, so implementation of the EU Charter must be the core of any fully-fledged ISS.

A common system for evaluating threats must therefore be developed, so as to permit the early detection of signs of violent radicalisation or threats. A comprehensive approach is essential to obtain an effective security policy within the European Union. The judicial systems of the Member States should be able to work together in the most effective way, including with the help of Europol and Eurojust. There must be synergies between internal and external aspects of security. Particular attention must be paid to security and border management. Full respect for the primacy of the law and fundamental rights is an essential component and must remain inseparable from this internal security strategy in the EU.

The EU has become a more unsafe place for us all to live in because it seems to have lost control. We live in an imperfect world and we cannot always make things seem better simply by talking about them. We must not ignore the fact that the Member States are responsible for security and justice and that the EU is therefore interfering in their sphere of authority. If you compare collaboration between the Member States and cooperation at EU level, there is no identifiable added value. It is important to remember as well that there are different legal systems in place (the Anglo-Saxon and the European systems) and that we would be preventing the Member States from exercising their legal rights if we moved to a uniform system.

I welcome the provision that freedom, security and justice are objectives that must be pursued in parallel and that the implementation of the EU Charter must be one of the strategy’s essential elements. It is nevertheless regrettable that, at the same time as we are striving to develop a European judicial culture, to ensure the coordination of Member States’ actions regarding the management of the external borders, a framework for the use and coordination of EU and national instruments, there was a very painful case in which, as a result of derogations from EU legislation, a citizen of a third country, suspected of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and who was arrested in an EU Member State, was released without being passed to the justice authorities of the EU Member State that brought charges against him. This inability to cooperate and a lack of solidarity goes against the spirit of the security strategy developed for the whole EU and undermines the Member States’ opportunities to seek justice.

In recognising that the EU has an additional value in ensuring a high level of security, we should not go along with the dominant discourse that there can be no individual liberty without us all becoming ‘pre-suspects’ and having to accept ‘continued and comprehensive state surveillance’ (as exemplified by the Data Retention Directive, and the PNR, TFTS and borders package proposals) to ensure collective security. The starting point should be an individual’s liberty from the state, and justification of law enforcement measures in the sense of them being both necessary and proportionate in a democratic society. Now that there has been a (partial) transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the EU in the area of justice and home affairs, we need to redefine ‘checks and balances’ to ensure security measures respect individual freedoms in a supranational context.</p>

I fully agree with the intention to create a common European area of freedom, security and justice and to adopt a unified strategy for all Member States.

In recent years, the number of crimes involving the possession of drugs has grown by 19%. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that this growth in crime will continue in the coming years. In its latest report on crime in Europe, the international policing agency, Europol, drew attention to Lithuanian organised crime. In the report entitled Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2011, Lithuania was mentioned 24 times, mostly in the context of organised crime. By comparison, Estonia is mentioned three times in the report, and Latvia only once. According to the Europol report, Lithuanian organised crime groups have established a drug trafficking infrastructure, developing supply routes and supplier networks in almost all regions of Lithuania. Given that Lithuania is an EU Member State, this is not just a problem for Lithuania but for the whole of Europe. Since 2008, the number of criminal offences in the EU has grown by 7% every year.</p>

We need to demonstrate skill in combining a broad approach to human security with relations with third countries, particularly in terms of border management, migration, the fight against organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking.

Little emphasis is placed on prevention, with the accent on reinforcing the conditions for punishment which, in the EU, very often means criminalising all social movements and forces that do not allow themselves to be pushed around by orders from the EU, as well as controlling the lives of the public whilst attacking their fundamental freedoms and guarantees.

Following the recent economic crisis, competent national authorities have fewer financial resources and, as such, there is an increased risk that the adoption of new legislation may not only fail to result in a better application of criminal law, but may also compromise the credibility and efficiency of EU criminal law to the obvious detriment of EU citizens. In my opinion, the European Union should adopt an extremely cautious approach to developing or amending criminal law.

A separate space has not been developed for criminal law provisions. In accordance with the Treaty on European Union, the Union pledges to offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal borders, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to, inter alia, the prevention and combating of crime. Criminal law provisions can therefore be found in instruments relating to justice and home affairs, but they can also be found in many other policy areas of the Union. There is a need for Parliament to develop its own procedures in order to ensure, together with the colegislator, a more coherent and effective criminal law system of the highest quality. It is not a criminal law provision in itself that may lead to less crime in the EU – the investigation of criminal offences and enforcement of penalties imposed for them is equally, if not more, important. The harmonisation of criminal law in the EU should contribute to the development of a common EU legal culture in relation to fighting crime, which adds up to but does not substitute national legal traditions and has a positive impact on mutual trust amongst the legal systems of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report proposes harmonisation of criminal law in Member States with the aim of establishing a common legal culture for combating crime. Criminal law differs from other areas of the law, specifically because, by its definition, it restricts certain human rights pertaining to the fundamental freedoms of the defendants and/or of those convicted. On many occasions, even though a person is not convicted, the criminal investigation itself may result in them being stigmatised, so that many people will tend to believe that there is no smoke without fire.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To facilitate cooperation in future, the institutions must agree on a certain kind of common framework. Such a framework could include a set of principles governing any criminal law instrument. I also think that such a framework ought to include specific guidelines on the internal procedures within each institution to ensure a coherent approach.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Although the Treaty now formally contains the basis for new EU criminal law provisions, this does not mean that criminal law has become any less sensitive. The Treaty thus provides an emergency brake procedure, in case a Member State believes that proposed legislation affects fundamental aspects of its criminal justice system. This is an exceptional procedure in the Treaty. The EU approach to criminal law should be based on a realisation that criminal law is different from other legal domains in that, by definition, it restricts certain human rights and fundamental freedoms of an accused or convicted person. In many cases, the freedom of movement is restricted, but even if the offence is only punishable by fines, at least the right to property is restricted. In addition, practical considerations should also be borne in mind. A flurry of new EU initiatives in the field of substantive criminal law may easily overburden national administrations. Proposals must be of such a nature that they can be fully implemented and enforced. Resources of the national competent authorities are limited, especially during the current economic crisis. The danger exists that the adoption of new legislation will fail to produce better enforcement, thus undermining both the credibility and the efficiency of EU substantive criminal law.</p>

By what authority can Brussels be the arbiter of criminal law when it has been proven so democratically bereft and unaccountable to its 500 million citizens? It lays the foundations for the creation of a European police state – something which no single member of the public in any Member State has ever voted for. We have Common Law in the UK and Scotland whose safeguards are being undermined by the creation of EU criminal law; important safeguards such as our Bill of Rights and Habeas Corpus.

However, the cross-border nature of many offences makes it essential to adopt criminal law measures at EU level in order to prevent criminals from being able to hide behind borders or take advantage of the differences between the national legal systems. The existence of basic rules also contributes to strengthening mutual trust between the Member States, which is essential, not only if there is to be cooperation between the various authorities, but also in order for the principle of mutual recognition to function effectively. We must take advantage of the new opportunities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon for developing EU-level criminal law that is homogenous, consistent and transparent, and that is of genuine benefit for the European public, reinforcing trust in the exercise of the rights to freedom of movement and acquisition of goods and services from other Member States.

Some steps have been taken in this regard, but others could and should still be taken.

Cooperation between Member States should still be extended in the area of policies for preventing high-level economic crime, a field in which the political will to do more and better has been wilting. However, the report goes beyond this approach, proposing harmonisation on criminal matters, which we consider unacceptable. This is an area in which the Member States must retain their sovereignty.

Although these restrictions are legal and legitimate, in each case, the issue of proportionality must be considered very sensitively. In legislative proposals governing criminal law, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are essential. However, we need to establish minimum standards of protection, and at the highest possible level. Citizens of the EU must be assured that their safety is taken seriously. Harmonisation of criminal law will assist Member States in the fight against crime, and should contribute to the development of a common legal culture and have a positive impact on mutual trust. When creating new legal instruments, however, we must fully respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the International Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as other international legal instruments governing human rights to which each of the Member States are bound. On the other hand, however, excessive use of legislation leads to a decline in the efficiency of criminal law. The fragmented approach to EU criminal law followed so far cannot be considered to be correct.

Approximating criminal law among the Member States is a very difficult task given its close relationship with social and political choices and the direct impact this has on people’s liberties. Furthermore there are differences in the levels of sanctions and prison regimes (including which part of the sentence is actually served). Therefore here, more than anywhere else, it is important that the legislation containing criminal definitions and sanctions is crystal clear and not open to differences in interpretation, something which is often resorted to in political compromises among the Member States (practice of constructive ambiguity).

      <p sl="pt">The EU has not developed a separate area relating to the provisions of criminal law and these are not just instruments of the field of justice and home affairs, but also many other areas of EU policy. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the pillars structure has disappeared and a basis has been introduced for the development of criminal law as an integral part of EU law. It is therefore important to know how to ensure the coherence and quality of a field of the law that seems to include such diverse areas of policy. In order to ensure the EU has a high-quality and consistent approach to criminal law, the three EU institutions mentioned would not only have to improve their internal structures, but also agree amongst themselves on the important working principles and methods.</p>

      <p sl="lt">We must establish a genuine common justice area in the EU. Citizens must believe that their rights will be defended wherever they are located in the 27 Member States. Recently, the European Commission admitted that ‘for a long time, the EU has tried to build the European criminal justice area with one hand tied behind its back’. In my opinion, there have been many occasions when the EU also covered its eyes with the other hand. The rapporteur states that growing trust is a prerequisite for common recognition throughout the EU of judicial decisions taken in other Member States. Common minimum standards must be set with regard to the right to a fair trial and the rights of the victims of crime in order to increase this trust. This is a problem in Lithuania. Given the many reports published by the European Council on Foreign Relations, judges in Lithuania are part of the problem because they opt for a more complex system which they can manipulate to their advantage, for example, a ‘tax’ for changing the trial date. According to data from a Eurobarometer poll carried out earlier this year, Lithuanians have little confidence in the courts – only 22% of Lithuanians trust the courts.</p>

The report highlights the principles of criminal law (principle of individual guilt, legal certainty, non retroactivity, ne bis in idem and presumption of innocence). Moreover, judicial cooperation in criminal law is based on the principle of mutual recognition. To fully apply this principle, some flanking measures are needed to develop and legitimise ‘mutual trust’ – within an EU common criminal legal culture.

As such, we do not advocate the harmonisation of criminal policies and the constitution of shared codes for criminal matters. In this regard, there are other paths to follow and explore in relation to combating crime, such as judicial cooperation, cooperation on investigations and combating crime.

Therefore, a significant portion of the internal market is closed to them, they pay more for products and they depend heavily on other people.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because promoting consumers’ rights and their protection are core values for developing relevant European Union policies, especially for reinforcing the single market, and for meeting the Europe 2020 goals. All consumers, at some point in their life, can become vulnerable because of external factors and their interactions with the market or because they have difficulties in accessing and comprehending relevant consumer information and therefore need special protection. The widely used concept of vulnerable consumers targets a heterogeneous group comprised of persons who are considered as such because of their mental, physical or psychological disability, age, credulity or gender. This concept should also include consumers who are placed in a state of temporary powerlessness resulting from a gap between their individual state and characteristics or their external environment, taking into account criteria such as education, their social and financial situation, or access to the Internet. The ambition for EU consumer policy should be a high level of empowerment and protection for every consumer. In creating a strategy for strengthening the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, it is essential to give them the opportunity to participate in the single market, to contribute not only to the social inclusion of such consumers and to the creation of a more just and tolerant society, but also to a more dynamic, safe and competitive interior market.</p>

Our priority is to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable consumers at all costs. Thus, for this group of consumers to be better included at the heart of the single market, it is worth targeting the causes and improving their protection. In this regard, some sectors such as food, transport, the Internet, liberalised markets, justice and digital services must be subject to increased controls in order to facilitate greater independence for consumers.

The Commission, in its planned revision of EU passenger rights legislation, must take into account the situation of vulnerable consumers, especially persons with reduced mobility and disabilities, and adapt the compensation levels, criteria and mechanisms, while ensuring that current levels are not reduced. The digitisation of services may mean that consumers who, for various reasons, cannot access or use the Internet, could find themselves in a situation of vulnerability, as they cannot take full advantage of the benefits of online commerce and are therefore excluded from a substantial part of the internal market, paying more for the same products or being dependent on assistance from others.

      <p sl="en">The United Kingdom has already established a number of independent bodies and organisations to protect consumers against unscrupulous advertising, misleading product sales and so forth. For example, the Financial Ombudsman regulates the financial sector, while the Advertising Standards Authority determines whether advertising is accurate and appropriate. Currently, the UK Government is looking into the protection of minors from overtly sexualised consumerism and exposure to risks to their well-being. The Office of Fair Trade oversees the protection of British consumers as a whole. Legislation such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Protection Act 1987 and the Electronic Commerce Regulations 2002 already exist to serve the consumer. Some of the legislation is UK application of EU law. Complaints are made to Consumer Direct, which provides legal advice and redirects individual complaints to the Trading Standards office for investigation. Creating an entire stratum of European law muddies the waters, leaving both consumers and merchants at risk from excessive bureaucracy and a compensation culture.

The ‘vulnerable consumer’ concept also includes children, older people and women. It also suggests paying particular attention to the specific conditions of certain individuals, such as those without access to the Internet or those with disabilities.

The consumer may be vulnerable for a number of reasons – because of their mental, psychological or physical disability, age, sex, or credulity, or if they are in a state of temporary powerlessness resulting, for example, from an adverse social or financial situation. Vulnerable consumers require special protection and it is important to take into account their specific needs and enhance their capabilities. Member States must take appropriate measures in this regard and ensure adequate guarantees. The most dangerous areas, where the level of vulnerability has been shown to be greatest, include energy, food, transportation, financial services, access to justice and telecommunications. In order to protect vulnerable consumers, we need to provide them with easily accessible and understandable information. As regards the requirement to provide sufficient information, I believe we need to draw attention to the fact that some categories of consumer are not aware of the existing complaint and redress schemes, especially in cross-border or e-commerce cases.

      <p sl="hu">Similarly, the moratorium on eviction can be considered merely as temporary assistance, as the debtor in difficulty still needs to evacuate his house or flat when the moratorium expires, and consumers cannot hope that their salaries will increase at the same rate as the interests on their loans.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thus, conciliation bodies, which play an exceedingly important role in the speedy, simple and free settlement of consumers’ legal disputes, must be strengthened in the future. However, in order for this to have an effect on consumer protection, all those important changes that social organisations representing consumer interests have long been pressing for need to be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="it">One of the most frequent criticisms levelled at the European Union concerns the democratic deficit, or the lack of opportunities for citizens to influence European decision-making processes. As the only institution whose members are directly elected by citizens, the European Parliament is particularly sensitive to these issues and, in 2010, it adopted the report on the proposal for a regulation on the citizens’ initiative: this is an opportunity for citizens to make their voices heard, and to bring issues of interest to the attention of the European institutions. An early example was seen a few weeks ago, when a committee of citizens living in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania and Spain presented an initiative to improve EU exchange programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Irigoyen Pérez opinion correctly highlights that well informed, empowered consumers, once offered the proper protections, can be the engine of growth and increased competitiveness for the Union. However, it is clear that consumers in many sectors remain very vulnerable, above all, in relation to financial products. Financial institutions often understate the risk of financial products to retail investors who are not familiar with financial risk. Consumer policy that is fit for purpose should be oriented not only towards providing the relevant legal protection, but also towards strengthening consumers’ power to make their own informed decisions and exercise their rights. The implementation of a comprehensive system of alternative and online dispute resolution for consumers, which would make resolving disputes between consumers and traders quicker, cheaper and easier, is an important initiative in this regard. I would now call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary further concrete legislative steps to address consumer vulnerability, particularly in relation to the advertisement of financial products and advertisements targeting children and adolescents.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to stress this, for example, in the context of discussion on the development of social enterprises. Alongside business objectives, social enterprises also pursue social objectives, thanks to which they better understand the needs of vulnerable consumers and are able to meet those needs more effectively. Therefore, by recognising the role of social enterprises in the single market we will help improve conditions for particularly vulnerable consumers. In this context, I would also like to stress the need to give better information to consumers in general, and even more so in the case of vulnerable consumers. Reliable information enables consumers to be active and more aware of their rights, and they more readily make use of the procedures provided for them.</p>

European legislation must address the problem of vulnerability among consumers as a horizontal task, taking into account consumers’ various needs, abilities and circumstances. The rapporteur has addressed specifically the following sectors: the financial sector, food, transport, Internet, liberalised markets and access to justice. Attention is also drawn to the vulnerability of senior consumers, in particular, in the context of the digitisation of services, and because of the added cost that the management of such services poses for brick-and-mortar offices and stores, which means, in many cases, that they pay more for the same products.</p>

In addition, the fact that the group of vulnerable consumers comprises a dynamically changing set of addressees which is very hard to define undermines the entire proposed philosophy of greater protection for vulnerable consumers. This all underlines the impossibility of defining such a group in legislative terms. It is not changed in any way by the fact that the term ‘vulnerable consumer’ has already been used in the directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market. Here, however, it is based on unfair competition practices, in relation to which an economic interest can be unambiguously quantified, both in the form of profit and in the form of damages.

For this reason, it is very important to protect children and young people, for example, from aggressive, dishonest and alcohol-related advertising.</p>

      <p sl="it">I agree with the notion that the reinforcement of vulnerable consumers’ rights does not only entail regulatory development but, above all, efforts to promote consumer empowerment through the provision of accessible and understandable information.

We also need stricter rules on advertising, which is misleading at times, and a greater control over the information given to the public in order to avoid buyers making ill-informed choices.

Most importantly, the report calls for the European Union and the Member States to pay more attention to, and to invest in, consumer information and education campaigns that target the right messages at the right consumer segment. Generally speaking, a strategy for strengthening the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, in order to permit their participation in the single market, contributes not only to their social inclusion and to advancement towards a more just and tolerant society, but also to ensuring a more dynamic, safe and competitive internal market.

I believe consumers should be protected from potential situations of commercial vulnerability, that the available information could be improved, and that safety standards guaranteeing that the market works effectively should be developed.

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report on strengthening the rights of vulnerable consumers. Liberalisation of the markets has increased competition, which can benefit consumers if they are properly informed and able to compare prices and choose their providers. The lack of transparency in the main markets, including in the energy and transport sectors, may cause further difficulties for consumers, in particular when identifying which is the appropriate tariff for their needs, switching providers and understanding the items billed. I call on the Commission and Member States to take the appropriate measures to ensure that all consumers have access to clear, understandable and comparable information about tariffs, conditions and means of redress, and can easily switch providers. In spite of existing legislation, vulnerable consumers still encounter difficulties when travelling. We call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure better provision of information and rapid access both to claims procedures regarding passengers’ rights and the mechanisms for resolving them. We call, as part of these procedures, for the situation of vulnerable consumers to be taken into account, especially of persons with reduced mobility.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome the rapporteur’s basic argument that strengthening the rights of the most vulnerable consumers contributes not only to the social inclusion of such consumers and a more just society, but also to ensuring a more competitive interior market. The rapporteur rightly notes that better consumer information is important for reducing the vulnerability of consumers. However, information alone is not enough. A Eurobarometer survey has revealed that Lithuanian consumers need a stronger consumer protection system. The survey showed that only 37% of Lithuanian consumers believe that they are adequately protected by existing consumer protection measures, compared with 59% in the EU. Lithuanian consumers are reluctant to trust government organisations that are supposed to protect their interests. Only 37% of Lithuanians believe that the authorities will protect their interests (compared with the EU average of 54%). Slightly more Lithuanians would trust consumer support associations – 42% of Lithuanians trust independent consumer organisations, which defend their consumers’ rights. The problem, as revealed by the World Bank report, is the fact that consumer organisations receive limited funding from governments, which is not enough. The ideal solution would be for government funding to be supplemented with funding from European agencies or for the latter to work with existing European consumer associations.</p>

Existing requirements on product information and product suitability do not do enough to protect vulnerable consumers, especially not the elderly. The report, which has my full support, calls for clear and simple information on products and services. Current rules do not do enough to protect travellers, especially when there are delays or cancellations and fares that are difficult to understand can lead to some consumers paying three times more than others.

      <p sl="pl">Consumer protection is an extremely important aspect of the European Union economy. At the present time, when producers are fighting each other to sell their products (sometimes illegally, sometimes at any cost), the people who buy these products – the consumers – often fall victim to various means of getting round the law and the rights of consumers. Cases of this type concern, in particular, a failure to inform consumers of the precise ingredients of a particular product (in the case of food). Often, consumers themselves are not fully aware of the rights they enjoy to compensation or to make complaints in cases where it is clear they were misled by the producer. In particular, consumers are not aware of their rights in the case of door-to-door sales and online and cross-border commerce. It is hardly necessary to add, here, that disabled people in particular face additional difficulties in ensuring proper enforcement of their rights as consumers, and are often wronged as a result. Furthermore, research shows that groups which are particularly vulnerable because of this feel discouraged from taking action when problems do occur. Therefore, it is very important that permanent information campaigns be conducted in the Member States, as this would make consumers aware of the rights to which they have recourse. I hope that taking such action will lead, in the longer term, to an improvement in seller-consumer relations, so that consumers will not be in a hopeless situation (as is often the case) when disputes arise.</p>

They are vulnerable and we need to take care of them. The rapporteur is correct in one respect: some people really are more vulnerable, such as elderly people or children. Their vulnerability is due to the weakening of family and neighbourhood relations. They need intergenerational solidarity, and not officials who do their shopping for them.</p>

If these small coins are abolished, it will result in goods becoming more expensive. We cannot and should not expect the citizens of Europe to accept that, because it is likely that prices will be rounded up. All the citizens of Europe are trying to save and have to think carefully before spending their money to ensure that they do not waste it.

One argument against euro coins is the literally massive weight of our wallets, as if we were still living in the Middle Ages. Of course, EUR 1 and EUR 2 banknotes are spent more quickly, but I would support the introduction of EUR 1 and EUR 2 banknotes if the Commission’s impact assessment has a positive result; i.e., if it would be less expensive to use paper money than coins, and this would have a positive influence on Europe’s tourism economy.</p>

Consequently, the economic interests of all Member States may be affected if one Member State fails to fulfil its obligations.</p>

If it is not implemented properly, even the most effective legislation will not deliver the awaited results.

These consequences are resulting in difficulties for many companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in the loss of jobs, and in the scaling back of workers’ rights. In the face of these problems, instead of rethinking current policy, they insist on speeding up the policies of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation that are in place, proposing more penalties and the quicker application thereof to ‘recalcitrant’ Member States.

      <p sl="it">I have often voted in favour of the annual report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. However, this year I think this report is excessively critical of the Member States, which, according to the rapporteur, are all too often to blame for misapplication of directives. While this may at times be true, I would stress that this often happens because of complicated texts which are not explicit, difficult to apply nationally or strongly opposed by citizens, sectors of workers or businesses. In my opinion, this report barely considers the social, political and economic reasons for some cases of non-transposition, nor does it recognise the fact that EU Member States have completely different constitutions and dimensions, some of which internally divide legislative competence between state and regions. For these reasons, I voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I voted in favour of this report because I, too, believe that if we wish to succeed in creating a single market that is open to the world but can, at the same time, rely on its own internal strength, then European-level efforts must be accompanied by appropriate performance at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As I already mentioned in my speech at the key debate, our task at this point is to enforce legislation without fear or favour, and we must continue to follow this approach in the future as well. It is very important that we meet citizens’ expectations concerning job opportunities, growth and security. If we wish to keep pace with the changes, we must make our regulatory framework sufficiently flexible, and must accept that not everything can be controlled from Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report focuses on the importance of correct transposition, application and enforcement of the EU directives. While emphasising the recent developments revealed by the internal market scoreboard, we should also acknowledge that some Member States are still failing to meet their objectives of correct and timely transposition of European legislation into national law. In the current economic crisis, Member States should ensure proper and timely implementation and transposition of European directives, especially legislation linked to the single market, which is instrumental in moving Europe towards sustainable growth and job creation. Therefore, more systematic, independent monitoring is needed in order to ensure proper implementation and transposition of single market legislation with the adoption of a more qualitative approach which looks beyond the figures and identifies the reasons for this deficit. The Commission should concentrate more of its efforts on strengthening tools to address informational, legislative and implementation gaps that persist within the single market, such as the SOLVIT network, the Single Market Forum, ‘the 20 main concerns’, which audit the progress of the single market and help citizens and businesses to familiarise themselves with their rights, entitlements and obligations within the single market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The citizens, which means consumers and business people, are a key component of the internal market, and it is them in particular we should have in mind when drafting legislation or making information available. However, they often have problems finding the right information and do not know what opportunities the internal market does, in fact, offer them. This is often caused by information being provided in the wrong way. I do appreciate the work of the Commission in this respect, but the number of portals offering information is often so overwhelming that the citizens get confused and, as a result, do not find the information they need. This is why it is so important to coordinate information tools.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have already pointed out the problem with efficient provision of information about the single market on numerous occasions. When it comes to the Services Directive, for example, the points of single contact were supposed to improve the situation but, as it turns out, they are not fully operational. The Member States should implement EU legislation in a way which makes the laws we adopt in Parliament useful to the people these laws are intended to benefit – the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The internal market scoreboard is a good tool for motivating the Member States to transpose legislation efficiently. Unfortunately, the latest scoreboard has shown that the trend in terms of implementation of legislation is negative in comparison with previous years. We should therefore send a clear signal to the Member States that the potential of the internal market can be fully achieved only with real commitment on their part.</p>

The internal market cannot work properly without the correct transposition, application and enforcement of the directives that contribute to its functioning. It is imperative that Member States transpose internal market legislation into national law not only in a timely manner, but also correctly, and failure to comply by a single Member State hinders the economic interests not just of that Member but of the Union as a whole. It is not enough to transpose European directives promptly and correctly, since the proper implementation of EU law is also of major importance. However, in my opinion, the EU should pay more attention to a cause-and-effect assessment as to why one Member State is able to implement the provisions mentioned in a timely manner, while another falls far behind. If we knew the real cause, perhaps we could achieve better results in this area.</p>

      <p sl="lv">This report is a continuation of the work that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) began in spring 2011, when it approved three reports on improving the European single market. I especially support the rapporteur’s call on the Commission to pay closer attention to the way in which Member States implement EU legislation. It makes no sense if legislation that has been drafted is not implemented at all or is only implemented partially. Also very valuable in my opinion is the call to improve the Your Europe portal, so that consumers and businesses could get all the relevant information in one place. In practice, there are several means of information available to facilitate consumer protection and fair cross-border trade. Unfortunately, public knowledge about these sources of information is minimal. Partly, this is doubtless due to the fragmentary nature of the information, and a single website would make this process easier. Although we use computers more and more, there are still people for whom human contact is important. That is precisely why I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal that a point of contact be established in every Member State, where advice could be obtained about such programmes as SOLVIT, Your Europe Advice, etc. This would involve minimal additional cost, since the points of contact would be located in the European Commission’s own representative offices. Educating people about these issues would help cross-border cooperation, and thus also promote economic growth. Finally, I should like to stress that we must continue our work on improving the single market. That is a growth promoting measure, which the European Union so badly needs right now.</p>

In particular, it is my experience that the naming and shaming approach has worked in a satisfactory way, and has made the countries that are lagging behind try a bit harder.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am happy with the approach taken by the rapporteur, which focuses partly on the regulatory framework and thus the transposition of the directives, and partly on how well such implementation is working for enterprises and citizens. The report points out some problem areas where action can be taken and, unfortunately, the new scoreboard underlines the fact that there are indeed some problems. In the first instance, it is important that we get back below the 1% limit for transposition of the directives and that we reduce the delay, these being some of the challenges indicated by the new scoreboard.</p>

The aim of the internal market scoreboard is to encourage the Member States to improve the quality and timeliness of the transposition of internal market directives. For example, in the last scoreboard, Malta was praised for its timely transposition of EU legislation. However, legal regulations alone will not guarantee that the internal market functions smoothly. In this context, it is important that the authorities work together across national borders. The report calls for tougher but more realistic transposition and implementation targets. Business consultancy organisations, such as SOLVIT and the European Consumer Centres, are still not as well-known as we would like and there are difficulties in identifying their different areas of responsibility.

Just one of many examples concerns the bogus self-employed workers in the building trade, who work as wage slaves in Austria and Germany. Frankfurt has become the centre of the ‘Bulgarian industry’. According to German tax investigators, between 10 000 and 17 000 bogus self-employed people are working in Frankfurt. The real figure is probably much higher. This brings major cost benefits for the construction companies, which would have to pay a domestic worker around EUR 35 per hour, whereas the bogus self-employed people generally cost as little as EUR 10. This cannot be what was intended when the internal market was established. While the fundamental freedoms are being exploited to the detriment of domestic companies, subcontractors and workers, the internal market scoreboard serves no useful purpose, regardless of how efficient it is.

Two directives are more than two years behind their transposition deadline, in direct violation of the ‘zero tolerance’ target set in 2007, while the number of incorrectly transposed directives remains at an average of 0.8%, despite the fact that the Commission pointed out in the Single Market Act the need for a clear, well-defined compliance deficit policy.</p>

The implementation of best practices into all Member States will not only create a level playing field but also increase their competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I support this resolution as I am very much in favour of building a stronger scoreboard to oversee the actions of Member States that fail to transpose or comply with European legislation. The case of Spain is, in that sense, an example of what should not be done.

      <p sl="lt">Less than five years ago, Lithuania found itself at the European Commission’s table where there was a discussion about how successfully Member States are transposing the EU’s internal market legislation into national law. The situation today is completely different. The latest figures published by the Commission this month revealed that Lithuania is having particular difficulties implementing single market legislation. As the rapporteur points out, the internal market is the best tool we have to restore Europe’s economic growth. According to the Commission’s latest calculations, full exploitation of the internal market may create approximately 4% growth in terms of GDP over the next ten years. In order to better exploit the opportunities of the single market, to promote growth and create jobs, we need a free and well integrated market, unhindered rights to provide services and less of an administrative burden on business. The meeting on issues affecting the EU internal market held a few weeks ago in Vilnius was a reminder that a digital single market is another area with significant untapped economic potential for Lithuania. Lithuanian consumers are often unable to take advantage of all the benefits of the EU internal market, for example, consumers from Lithuania are unable to acquire goods on the Internet from another Member State because the latter does not sell goods to Lithuania.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The internal market is a reliable and effective instrument for securing prosperity and economic growth, and is thus also a means of reducing unemployment. Although the internal market was to have been achieved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, its completion is still not in sight. European cooperation has, in the meantime, moved towards a further phase of integration – monetary and political union – without, however, achieving a single internal market. For example, the services market is still no more than two-thirds liberalised. Excessive regulation continues to hamper the activities of entrepreneurs and thereby also economic growth. The current EU acquis comprises more than 9 000 legislative acts. We therefore need to implement a radical cure. It is good that EU institutions have committed to reducing the administrative burden for the smallest enterprises, but more needs to be done. All legislative proposals and existing regulations should be evaluated in terms of the regulatory burden. It is clear that our interest in meeting objectives in the area of the internal market will not be satisfied if we leave out the implementation of the adopted measures. It is therefore necessary to transpose all existing legislation consistently, as we cannot consider acceptable an average deficit in implementation of 1.2%. Our clear priority must be not only the elimination of barriers, but also compliance with the rules on the EU’s internal market. I have therefore voted in favour of this report.</p>

However, I would stress the progress, specifically as regards the establishment of a specialised domestic violence bureau within the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, and the authorities’ efforts in relation to women’s education and entry into the labour market; these have contributed to the gradual evolution of women’s rights and the right to equality between men and women.

The main positive changes are reflected in the institution of a legislative framework for women’s rights. However, implementation of this legislation is still not at satisfactory levels and there is also a need to step up cooperation between the government of Turkey and civil society, which should be facilitated by the recent creation of the Ministry of Family and Social Policies. Violence against women is one of Turkey’s most urgent problems. As such, a zero-tolerance policy should be applied. The current law should be amended to implement more effective and immediate measures, and to ensure it is uniformly applied by all the competent authorities. Finally, I would stress the indispensable role of the media in changing mentalities to transform Turkish society into one based on gender equality.

They face discrimination and violence on a daily basis, and recently there has been an alarming resurgence of violence, in spite of existing legislation. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, 39% of Turkish women have encountered physical violence at some point in their lives, and two or three women are killed each and every day at the hands of their husbands. As in the other countries concerned, the responsibility lies with the authorities to respond and adopt restrictive, effective measures in order to prevent such acts of violence, punish the perpetrators and protect the victims. There is no doubt that education is the way to bring about gender equality, a change in mentality, the empowerment of Turkish women and their inclusion in the social, economic and political life of their country. I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which gives an account of the situation for Turkish women and sends a message to Turkey, inviting it, as a candidate country, to make women’s rights a priority and to increase its efforts to adopt comprehensive reforms and guarantee respect for fundamental rights in order to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.</p>

Turkey is invited to continue carrying out and supervising the implementation of legislative reform, as well as organising awareness-raising activities to combat violence against women, including domestic violence. Turkey is making limited progress in improving and implementing the legislative framework so as to ensure equal participation by women in social, economic and political life. Sustained further efforts are needed to convert the existing legal framework into a reality because gender equality, fighting violence against women, including honour killings, and combating early and forced marriages remain major challenges for this country.

We want to send a strong signal to the Turkish political authorities encouraging them to implement public awareness-raising policies as quickly as possible and encourage the participation of women in politics. In this regard, the Commission has suggested adopting a mandatory quota system for electoral lists. In a social environment marked by a high rate of illiteracy and low level of education, this positive discrimination measure would enable women to become role models, thereby normalising the part they play in society.

I welcome the fact that Turkey has made moves to support women’s rights and participation in society, in particular, in schools and on the labour market. We can continue our cooperation in encouraging female entrepreneurs, not just in large cities, but also in rural areas.

Furthermore, the police, prosecutors and judges are often divided when it comes to the scope of the law and the punishment to be given to the person who has resorted to violence.

Turkish women are exposed to daily discrimination and violence; their human rights and fundamental freedoms are violated. Honour killings are committed, early and forced marriages are entered into and gender-based crimes are perpetrated. The ineffectiveness of the existing remedies and the lenience of the Turkish authorities is striking, and the situation in the country is reaching alarming levels. If Turkey truly wishes to become a fully-fledged pluralist democracy, with respect for and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of both men and women at its core without distinctions of any kind, there must be a re-evaluation of the existing rigid values regarding women’s role in society.

The European Parliament is not the only body to have reported on the matter. According to the UN Women report, violence against women in Turkey is more common than in Europe and in the United States. Many women each day are the victims of honour killings. The employment rate among women is also alarmingly low. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of the issue in Turkey, and NGOs, in particular, have been admirably active in this area. Moreover, the Turkish Government has worked hard to eradicate the problem, something which many EU countries could also learn from. Turkey has an excellent legislative framework for improving the status of women, and the government has drawn up national action plans to eradicate violence against women, improve the education and literacy of women and girls, and provide more employment opportunities for women. For example, the gender gap in basic education has almost entirely disappeared. The biggest problem is implementing the plans, plus the fact that the Turkish Government has not worked closely enough with civil society. Parliament’s report makes proposals on such matters as the education of women and girls, opportunities in the labour market and policy making, as well as violence against women and girls. The report praises Turkey for certain reforms, such as the creation of the post of Minister for Family and Social Policies and the establishment of the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women.

The (theoretical) will to introduce reforms does not reach as far as rural communities in particular. In the light of the increasing Islamist tendencies, it is hardly surprising that violence against women remains one of the most pressing problems in Turkey. Honour killings are still a common practice. The attitude to honour killings has also resulted in them taking place among the more extreme Islamic immigrant communities in Europe. When you consider how long violence against women was tolerated in European society, the lack of progress in this area is not surprising. At least the subject of violence against women is under increasing discussion in Turkish society. This report calls on the Turkish Government to introduce a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women. As Turkey’s accession to the EU would not only push the integration capacity of the EU beyond its limits, but would also constantly make it clear to Ankara that in the case of the minorities issue and the freedom of the press, for example, Turkey’s values are totally different to those of Europe, the only honest response is to stop the accession negotiations and begin talks about a privileged partnership.

An extremely important matter in this area is that of violence against women. The Turkish Government has taken steps in the right direction here: it has appointed a new Minister for Family and Social Policies, established a Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women within the Turkish Parliament, opened a domestic violence bureau, reorganised the system of shelters for women, set up telephone helplines and established Women Monitoring Centres. Turkey was the first country to ratify the European Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence. These policies must be continued, but much greater speed is necessary. More action is needed, as are better results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to official data, 39% of Turkish women have encountered physical violence at some point in their lives. Some become the victims of ‘honour’ killings, some are forced into marriage, others are subjected to psychological violence. A UN report shows that Turkey has one of the highest rates of violence against women in the world. Amendment of Law No 4320 on the Protection of the Family is needed; the changes made should ensure that suitable means are made available to combat violence and that mechanisms exist which protect victims and punish the perpetrators.

This initiative, which was first introduced in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and then taken over by the Treaty of Lisbon, has the aim of giving citizens powers of political initiative on a par with those already enjoyed by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The main aim of this new instrument of participatory democracy is to provide citizens with a means to be heard by enabling them to refer various issues of interest to the European institutions. Another aim of the citizens’ initiative is to encourage more active cross-border debates.

      <p sl="fr">This report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs sets out the conditions for organising public hearings, which Parliament and the European Commission will hold with the organisers of European citizens’ initiatives (ECIs) having obtained a minimum of 1 million signatures from citizens from at least one quarter of EU Member States. The Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member, will organise the hearings, taking into account the committees responsible for the initiative. As the committee closest to the citizens, the Committee on Petitions has many years of experience in dealing with citizens’ complaints, which justifies its role in the organisation of the ECIs. The ECI is effectively a natural extension of the work of the Committee on Petitions. Furthermore, by assigning management of the practical arrangements to this committee, the institution is offered greater clarity in respect of European citizens. This report also mentions the importance of strengthening the rules on transparency when preparing initiatives as well as the need to simplify procedures. To this end, a practical guide will be drawn up to provide citizens with clearer information regarding the arrangements for the scheme.</p>

The regulation applies as of 1 April 2012 and Parliament’s Rules of Procedure therefore need to be amended so that the necessary measures can be taken in terms of organising and conducting the public hearings concerned. I think, first and foremost, that a ‘one-stop shop’ needs to be set up in order to simplify the exchange of views and dialogue with citizens, representative associations and civil society.

These public hearings will have to take place whenever this citizens’ initiative has gathered more than 1 million citizens’ signatures from at least seven Member States. Once it has, the Commission will then record it in the register and send it to the European Parliament, whose President will have to forward it to the competent committee.

This report helps strengthen this tool for the direct participation of citizens by insisting that public hearings on petitions that satisfy the necessary requirements must be organised by the competent committees, and by creating a single desk to facilitate practical implementation.

While we agree with holding hearings to debate the subjects tackled by this set-up created by the Treaty of Lisbon, the contradictions and limitations of this particular initiative should be remembered. Specifically, we should remember the demagogical way this was promoted: the attempt to whitewash the impoverishment of democracy, and to make us forget that Europe’s leaders prevented the peoples from having their say on the Treaty of Lisbon. This procedure is now being repeated with the so-called fiscal pact. We should remember that 1 million signatures from a significant number of Member States are required simply to ‘invite’ the European Commission to table a suitable proposal concerning issues on which these citizens think there is a need for an EU legal act to apply the Treaties. In other words, after all the work of collecting signatures and fulfilling the requirements that the draft regulation lays down, there is no guarantee that the citizens’ demand will be considered.

      <p sl="it">The citizens’ initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon is a tool for participatory democracy, which involves citizens in decisions and actively helps to establish the political agenda through a shared path towards stronger European integration. Being able to present the initiative in a public hearing with the direct participation of the relevant parliamentary committee helps to strengthen our dialogue with European citizens, at a particularly difficult time for the solidity of the economy and for consolidation of political Europe. The times we are living in are characterised by the development of Eurosceptic movements, which is why I believe that the initiative is an important step to bring European citizens closer, even physically, to the EU institutions. For this reason, I voted in favour of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure.</p>

What indeed could be more relevant than banking on our future generations and strengthening European exchange programmes that have stood the test of time, such as Leonardo, Erasmus or the European Voluntary Service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Gurmai report voted on this afternoon is not, in truth, aimed at the issues that citizens want to reclaim for themselves; instead, it looks more at the process and role that the European Parliament will play in promoting this tool of direct democracy. It wisely proposes organising public hearings on the most promising citizens’ initiatives. Given the six petitions already registered in the race for a million signatures, I just hope that the European Parliament will take it upon itself to only support those petitions of general interest, those that are inclusive rather than divisive. Out goes then the initiative ‘uno di noi’, whose questionable objective is to ban all forms of research on embryonic stem cells. When it comes to this type of issue, a more liberal and humanist approach is self-evident.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union has long been criticised for its lack of democracy and its potential remoteness from the real concerns of European citizens. As politicians, we should not rest until we overcome these shortcomings. One tool that may help us here is the citizens’ initiative, which is set to become a powerful tool that focuses on European citizens, who can use it to actually influence the agenda of the EU’s legislative initiatives. Article 11 of the regulation on the citizens’ initiative provides that the European Parliament is competent to hold public hearings of the organisers of each citizens’ initiative. This provides us, as representatives of citizens’ interests, with an important resource to support them in their efforts. Through this report, we are endeavouring to adapt our rules as best we can so that these hearings are completed successfully. I therefore voted for this report and supported the principle of our President appointing the committee responsible for organising the public hearing, while still involving the Committee on Petitions. I hope that the scheme that we have put in place here will contribute to the success of some interesting citizens’ initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour. The regulation on the citizens’ initiative (Procedure File No 2010/0074(COD) was adopted on 16 February 2010 and applies as of 1 April 2012. It allows for the submission to the Commission of initiatives by Union citizens for any appropriate proposal on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties, and which has received the support of at least 1 million signatories from at least one quarter of all Member States. The regulation provides for organisers to present the initiative at a public hearing. According to Article 11 of the regulation, the Commission and Parliament shall ensure that this hearing is organised at the European Parliament, if appropriate together with such other institutions and bodies of the union as may wish to participate. For our group, it is vital to ensure workable rules that allow for the proper organisation of the hearings, and proper involvement of the Petitions Committee, where desired, and to avoid a mix-up or alteration of current decision-making powers within the House.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European citizens’ initiative, established by the Treaty of Lisbon, entered into force on 1 April 2012 as an example of direct democracy and a useful tool for opening up new horizons for European citizens.

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of the report since the legislative initiative, if well developed, is a real democratic tool.

Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 states that the organisers shall be given the opportunity to present the citizens’ initiative at a public hearing, with wide-ranging technical support from the European Parliament and the European Commission. I should like to stress the creation of a ‘one-stop shop’ for dialogue and exchange between citizens to make it easier to implement initiatives, the possibility for speakers to take part in public hearings, and the possibility for reimbursement of transport costs, pursuant to certain rules. Despite the importance of this initiative, it should be stressed that not all initiatives will result in a Commission legislative proposal, but this instrument represents a crucial development in the possibility for debating the European project.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of amending the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure with regard to the implementation of the European citizens’ initiative. The citizens’ initiative is a powerful tool which is available to citizens and is intended to grant them powers of political initiative on a par with those already enjoyed by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The aim of the initiative is to provide citizens with a means of submitting specific problems to the European institutions which they consider important and feel that are being ignored or not given any support. The European Parliament will be able to help achieve these aims by doing all it can to support the citizens’ initiatives considered eligible, in particular, by organising public hearings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this regard, the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure need to be amended, especially the article on public hearings on citizens’ initiatives and the article on the citizens’ initiative. At the same time, we think that a point of single contact needs to be established in the European Parliament, to which citizens, representative associations and civil society can refer on matters relating to European citizens’ initiatives. We call for suitable measures to be taken at Parliament level to ensure a high profile for public hearings on citizens’ initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I have always supported all initiatives like the European citizens’ initiative, which are aimed at enhancing the direct link between citizens and the institutions, ensuring that issues are referred to EU institutions which citizens feel are being ignored. The European citizens’ initiative may help EU citizens participate actively in the EU’s decision-making process. Sadly, in Lithuania, there is a lack of serious citizens’ initiatives. A study recently published by the London School of Economics (LSE) revealed that despite the fact that there are legislative tools of direct democracy, the political influence of such institutions remains very uncertain. The LSE report indicates that this is mostly due to Lithuanians’ great distrust of politicians and political institutions, as well as their sceptical view of citizens’ opportunities to influence politicians. I am also very concerned by civil society’s failure to develop, and its weakness and passiveness in Lithuania. The problem is partly down to the fact that in Lithuania, there are strict procedural requirements for citizens’ initiatives. In Lithuania, organisers of citizens’ initiatives have to collect 300 000 signatures in three months (11.4% of the entire population). Proportionally, this is several times more than in the majority of EU Member States, and this further reduces the creation of citizens’ initiatives.</p>

How can we talk of ‘participation’ when key subjects – such as the potential accession of Turkey to the European Union – cannot even be put on the agenda? The fact that the European Parliament does not contemptuously dismiss this charade, this obvious total bunk, is yet another in a countless series of missed opportunities.</p>

However, there are others who feel that the Committee on Petitions, which has consistently worked on grievances from EU citizens, could somehow be left out of the process. It is this point that is unsettling. The Committee on Petitions is best suited, and has the required track record, to protect the grievances presented to the EU institutions by our constituents.

Thanks to this initiative, EU citizens have obtained the right to intervene directly in the process of European legislation. Today, the citizens’ initiative has become a hit of sorts, but I am slightly concerned that interest in the initiative will gradually subside after a short period. People may become frustrated if the Commission registers an initiative and, in the end, rejects it after having collected millions of signatures. In this context, it is natural that Parliament will do everything possible to be favourable towards civic initiatives.

We think this initiative has numerous limitations. It was promoted demagogically to whitewash the European Union’s attacks on democracy. If the intention is to listen to citizens, why were the peoples barred from having a say on the Treaty of Lisbon and why are they now being barred from having a say on the fiscal pact? What this initiative means is that 1 million signatures collected in a significant number of Member States trigger the ability to ‘invite’ the European Commission to table a suitable proposal concerning issues on which these citizens think there is a need for an EU legal act to apply the Treaties. In other words, there is no guarantee to the citizens that their demand will be considered. The amendments to the Rules of Procedure simply regulate Parliament’s participation in this process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioners, honourable Members, the meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 23 May is intended to discuss informally a comprehensive set of measures designed to promote growth and jobs in preparation for the June European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has not been a discussion in the Council of the informal European Council so I will use this opportunity to provide you with the Presidency’s expectations. There has been much talk about an austerity strategy versus a growth strategy. I would like to make it very clear that this is a false distinction. What we in the Danish Presidency have been working on throughout our period in office is a dual approach where we pursue fiscal discipline and growth at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot create growth if we do not have economic stability. Economic growth will contribute to public finances, and structural reforms will contribute both to consolidation efforts and to increasing growth and competitiveness. I believe that there is a wide agreement among Member States on this dual approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">This informal European Council meeting on 23 May will provide an opportunity to focus on the various measures that form part of the EU’s growth agenda. The aim is to inject further momentum into that process. The Danish Presidency warmly welcomes this increased momentum. The meeting will be a stepping stone towards the European Council in June where the Heads of State or Government can be expected to task further work grouped under the following headings:</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, mobilising new policies to fully support growth: the informal meeting will be an opportunity to highlight the rapid progress which needs to be made in the Council and in the European Parliament on a number of proposals which have the potential to boost growth. Obvious examples are the Single Market Act and the patent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency has been particularly committed to making progress on these issues. But further efforts are needed, in particular, to help boost employment, and particular attention is also needed to tackle youth unemployment. The Presidency therefore warmly welcomes the Commission’s employment package.</p>
      <p sl="en">A further key element to the growth agenda is the external economic policy. Here again, the Presidency, together with the Commission, is preparing for a discussion in June on how to make better use of strategic partnerships in support of our trade and economic interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, gearing Member States’ policies to growth: it is essential that we continue with the reform agenda, which remains crucial to ensuring job-creating growth. This will be dealt with in more detail in June when we will bring the European Semester to a close and endorse country-specific recommendations to guide Member States in their structural reforms and employment policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on financing the economy, we must continue to pursue an approach based on smart fiscal consolidation. That means reducing debt and deficits, but in a way which allows scope for continuing to invest for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of specific initiatives which are likely to be raised at this week’s meeting and which will certainly need to be developed further.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the EIB could be better mobilised to support SMEs and help finance key infrastructure projects. Heads [of State or Government] may be invited to agree to the principle of increasing the banks’ capital and of strengthening existing joint instruments. It is also important that agreement be reached on the project bonds pilot phase, which we hope to achieve at our negotiations with Parliament today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the Structural Funds should be better focused on competitiveness and convergence. For the current funds, this means reallocation with an emphasis on SMEs, youth training and employment. We shall make sure that the EU’s future budget, including cohesion, is targeted to sustain and develop growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The meeting tomorrow is informal. There will be no preparatory discussions in the Council and no formal conclusions. The purpose will be to agree on principles and ideas for generating growth in Europe. Let me underline that the Danish Presidency has, from the very first day, consistently stressed the overriding priority which is attached to putting Europe back on the growth track. It has been the focus of the informal European Council in January, the European Council in March, and now again in May and June. We have been working hard to ensure rapid adaptation of relevant legislation. We are grateful that this objective is shared by Parliament and that we have enjoyed constructive cooperation. But now we need to take the next steps, and that is the task ahead for the Council, for this Parliament and for the Commission. We need to work together to secure growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-362-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first say on behalf of President Barroso that he very much wanted to be here today to have this debate with you. However, his attendance at the G8 and the NATO meeting in Chicago made it impossible for him to be back from the US in time.</p>
      <p sl="en">On his behalf and with the team, together with my colleagues, Michel Barnier and László Andor, let me outline to you the Commission’s action plan for growth and jobs with a view to tomorrow’s informal summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, we find ourselves at a turning point in the debt crisis. At the same time, the European Union is now witnessing a new level of debate about growth and how precisely to achieve growth, which is definitely positive and indeed necessary. From the outset, the Commission has insisted on a twin-track policy response that combines both stability and growth. From the outset, we have combined concrete proposals for stability with concrete proposals for growth. The Commission is grateful that this House has supported those ideas since very early on. It is very good news that the Member States are now also more willing to take action in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see tomorrow’s dinner of Heads of State or Government as an opportunity to seize the moment for growth, and as a major stepping stone to the European Council at the end of June 2012. On 30 May, i.e. between the two Councils, the Commission will present its country-specific recommendations, addressing the specific economic challenges facing each and every Member State as well as the Union generally. On 30 May, we will also set our line on implementing the Stability and Growth Pact in a growth-friendly and differentiated way, applying its inbuilt scope of judgment, which focuses on the structural sustainability of public finances over the medium term and takes into account the fiscal space and macro-economic conditions of each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will use these opportunities in the summits to urge Member States to deliver on the commitments they have made to strengthen stability, implement structural reforms and boost sustainable growth and employment. We will urge Member States to continue to build the bedrock of economic stability. Pursuing sound public finances is really not an option but a necessity. We can never have sustainable growth as long as we have an unsustainable debt. We are starting to see a rebalancing of our economy. Deficits are falling across Europe. There is simply no other way to build confidence and cut borrowing costs. Every euro spent on servicing debt is a euro less for jobs and investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our Schuman Day statement two weeks ago, the Commission called for accelerated implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which has been endorsed by each and every Member State as a means of accelerating action for jobs and growth in the short term. This will be the key message President Barroso will bring to tomorrow’s informal European Council. He will urge the Heads of State or Government to back a growth initiative that will serve as a catalyst for faster and more robust economic recovery. The Commission will present this in more detail before the June European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would also remind you that the Europe 2020 strategy is the agenda for the long-term health and sustainability of our economy. Meeting its climate and energy targets alone could create up to five million new jobs in Europe, putting almost a quarter of our unemployed people into work. But Europe 2020 must be for today as well as for tomorrow. With the right political pressure, we can start to make a difference today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you just two very concrete and very topical examples. First, we have asked Member States to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate with third parties on tax evasion and fraud. National treasuries lose revenues through tax evasion, and these are losses they simply cannot afford. Twenty-five Member States want the European Union to move ahead in these negotiations, while two again blocked the measure at the last ECOFIN Council at a cost of potentially tens of billions of euro for European taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another example: we need to step up the pace of trade negotiations with the key global partners. If Europe is to grow, it needs to ride the wave of global growth. Our exports to Korea, for instance, shot up by 20% last year – 2011 – following the entry into force of our free trade agreement. There are many more opportunities out in the world economy and we must do all we can to seize them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, there are many measures that we can take quickly to strengthen our economies and send a message of confidence. Promoting public and private investment is a cornerstone of our growth initiative. We will, first of all, propose that Member States commit a further EUR 10 billion to the European Investment Bank. This could unleash many times that amount in new investment. The EIB could expand its lending volume, which is a quick and effective way of channelling badly needed stimulus to the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind you that this is a proposal which President Barroso put before this House on 28 September 2011, in his State of the Union address. Now there is momentum to get it off the ground, with a focus on financing innovative and competitive small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in countries and regions where such financing is most needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EIB and the Structural Funds can also be used more effectively through limited risk sharing with private investors. We welcome, too, the excellent progress in the negotiations with Parliament and the Council recently on our project bond proposal, and we look forward to an agreement in the trialogue meeting later today. We estimate that the project bonds could unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion of investment in infrastructure and innovation already in a pilot phase.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also urge immediate agreement on our growth-focused budget for next year, 2013, with agreement by the end of the year on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014 to 2020. This will be an important signal of Europe’s readiness to invest in its future: in job-rich green growth and innovation-based reindustrialisation in Europe. And, in truth, the MFF is our Marshal Plan for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will look at further optimising the use of the Structural Funds. We want to invest them better and use the funds as catalysts to boost sectors such as renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also continue to work for a swift adoption of the financial transaction tax proposal which the Commission put forward last September and on which you are voting, I think, tomorrow or the day after. In June, we will bring forward new detailed proposals on how its EUR 57 billion a year of revenue could be used for targeted investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the structural side, there are many things we can do that cost little but can have a major impact on our economy. The single market for goods has opened up vast opportunities for economic dynamism but we must be blunt and honest here: it is incomplete and unbalanced. It does not currently work for services, and that penalises those Member States that most urgently need to catch up. It is also failing to bring out the full potential of the digital economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Barroso will tomorrow urge the Heads of State or Government to implement the Single Market Act quickly, starting with the European patent, which must be adopted in June. It is high time to clear the way for the bright innovators of today to become Europe’s successful entrepreneurs of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the leadership of Michel Barnier, and in order to keep up the pressure for implementation, the Commission will present a single market governance scoreboard in June, as well as proposals to get more out of the Services Directive. In addition, whilst pursuing the growth agenda, we must address the social emergency that many Europeans face today with the same determination with which we address the economic challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Andor is steering our work in this field, where our focus is on Europe’s most immediate social challenges. The most pressing challenge is, of course, unemployment, and especially youth unemployment, which, in some countries, is at intolerable levels. In January, the President announced the creation of action teams to mobilise efforts in the eight Member States with the highest proportion of young people out of work. He will present the results of these efforts tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking beyond the immediate horizon, I believe that a long-term perspective on the future of economic and monetary union is necessary to keep us all moving in the right direction. Therefore, we need to reflect on what kind of European Union would be required to deepen economic and political integration – for instance, so that joint issuance of debt would make sense for all Member States sharing the single currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last November’s Green Paper on stability bonds will be followed up soon, ideally with a medium-term to long-term road map that outlines the deeper fiscal and economic integration necessary in order to minimise moral hazard and ensure fiscal sustainability – in other words, the features of an economic and political union required to make mutualisation of debt rational for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to close with a word on Greece. The Commission’s message to the Greek people is this: we want Greece to remain part of the European family and of the euro. After living beyond its means for too long, the journey Greece is now undertaking is difficult and demanding, but it is a journey we are taking together in a pact of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The euro area has stood by Greece in all of its difficulties and we will continue to do so, not only through the unprecedented levels of financial assistance contained in the two packages and the debt write-down – that together are equal to EUR 33 600 per Greek citizen – but also through the many assistance and support programmes, the effective implementation of which depends on the determination of the Greek leaders and people. I am talking here about programmes to get the Structural Funds working on the ground where they are needed: loans for small and medium-sized enterprises, support for young people without jobs, and technical assistance to reform tax systems to make them efficient and fair, and to eliminate red tape for businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are ready to stand by Greece on its journey of reform. We want to stand by Greece. Having said that, Greece must remain determined to reform. We are convinced that there is no easier way. We are convinced that the alternative would be far worse. So let me take this opportunity to call on all responsible forces in Greece to use these few precious weeks to get the facts across, so that the Greek people can make a fully informed and responsible choice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will conclude. There is no silver bullet for economic growth. If there were, it would have been fired already. The build-up of debts, deficits and imbalances in our economies did not happen overnight. It happened over many years, and the rebalancing we are now going through will not be concluded overnight either. That is why it is so important to stay the course on sustainable and sound public finances. At the same time, the Commission strongly supports the renewed drive for growth that is now sweeping across Europe. We are confident that there is now the political will and determination to move forward, starting with many of the proposals for sustainable growth that the Commission has already put on the table. Now is the moment to go further with our actions for growth and to get them working at the service of Europe’s citizens. We count on you here in this House to help make it happen. There is no reason to wait. Indeed, there is no time to lose.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in many Member States, all the stops are being pulled out in order to get our economy back on its feet and to get the budget under control. I have respect for countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy for the efforts they are putting in, but also for a country in a completely different part of Europe, namely Poland, our beacon of growth in eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are making progress, but the situation remains very fragile, and the engine of growth is faltering. We therefore have to go all out to safeguard our social market economy. We have to do our utmost to tackle unemployment and, above all, unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment, as well as to ensure a strong small and medium-sized business sector as an important jobs creator for our economy. That need is urgent, and we need to be creative in searching to find the solution, not least in order to safeguard a future for our social model.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, our group advocates economic growth built on strong foundations. We advocate sustainable economic growth rather than economic growth built on quicksand. Simply focusing on spending more money and increasing our debts is not the path we advocate, as that would mean passing on our debts to the next generation. Growth is not a magic spell that enables us to avoid painful and sometimes unpopular measures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">No, if we really do tackle the problems now, we can provide a sense of perspective and regain people’s confidence. That is our goal. Our group stands for tangible solutions, and these involve implementing reforms in order to return government finances to good health and reforms in order to return the foundations of our economy to good health.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also clear from the report published by the OECD today that priority efforts are required in this regard. These reforms will cause some pain, but in the long run, they will bring in money instead of costing it. The first, most important priority in this is competitiveness. If we re-establish that, then we can once again occupy a sturdy position in export markets, provide jobs for our people and ensure economic growth. In particular – as I said already – the big issue has to be youth unemployment. We have to provide an opportunity for our young people again, and to do so we also need to establish binding targets in the Member States. Easy access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is thus an important priority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we need to go further with reforms. We need to continue the efforts based on the ‘six-pack’, the Stability and Growth Pact and macro-economic surveillance, and the Commission has, for the first time, an important role to play here in evaluating the plans of the Member States. I call on the Commission to be ambitious. Highlight good examples, but also let us see where there are deficiencies and greater efforts are needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second focal area for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is our internal market. Mr President, we may have heard the new French President, Monsieur Hollande, talking about growth, but we have not heard him talk about tangible reforms that he will introduce in France in order to return the French economy to good health. We have also heard nothing from President Hollande about how he intends to promote the internal market. It alone can already deliver 2% economic growth per annum, and we have more work to do in that regard, in the interests of Europe’s 500 million consumers. There is a great deal of potential that remains unexploited.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am pleased, Commissioner, that you referred to the European patent, as that is something that we really should be sorting out quickly at this point. There should also be harmonised rules on data protection and legislation for professional qualifications. In addition, we know that, in many areas, European legislation is in place, but that there is a failure in implementation. This also applies to infringement procedures, which are too slow and too toothless.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Perhaps we also need to be much more active in terms of reporting in connection with the European Semester; producing reports, naming and shaming, and making it clear where things need to be better, including in that area. Linked to the internal market, red tape is also important and needs to be tackled. An extra 25%.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The third priority for our group is increasing investments that actually contribute to growth. Sooner rather than later, we need to tackle research and innovation, investment in infrastructure, utilising unspent European funds and the role of the European Investment Bank, including in relation to project bonds. I hope that we can now get going on all of this really quickly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to wish you a great deal of wisdom, including tomorrow and in the run-up to the European Council. We are on your side in order to also realise these priorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, with your permission, I would like to add briefly to the statement that you made yesterday about Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my solidarity and sympathy with the Italian people, who have been so hard hit by two serious events: the brutal attack at the Morvillo-Falcone school in Brindisi, where the young Melissa Bassi lost her life, and the powerful earthquake which hit Emilia-Romagna, an area I have often visited and whose strength and tenacity I am familiar with.</p>
      <p sl="it">The victims and their families must know that we are with them, that the whole of Europe supports them and that together we will overcome this.</p>
      <p sl="de">What does this have to do with the situation in Europe? I believe that it has a great deal to do with it, because the sense of unity and solidarity which has been shown within Italy itself and which we are showing towards Italy is something that I would like to see in the context of the major disaster that has occurred in Europe in the area of unemployment. I am of the opinion that we must do everything possible to ensure that this informal summit and later the formal summit have the courage to tackle the serious problem of unemployment, because we are in a position to prevent it from increasing and to take active measures to combat it, which is perhaps not as easy in the case of an earthquake. However, unemployment is not an act of God. It is a man-made problem and we can stop it from happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our view, the starting point must be to encourage investment. We have reached an historic low point with regard to both public and private investment and it is no coincidence that our unemployment rates are so high, given that our investment levels are so low.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regardless of whether we extend the deadlines for achieving budget stability, but without putting it at risk, or whether we go back to Mario Monti’s golden rule, which I believe would be very helpful and which states that certain investments, especially in Europe 2020 projects, must be removed from the deficits, we must make investment possible, so that we can return to growth. Of course, we need the funding to do this and it could come from the financial transaction tax that we will debate and decide on tomorrow or from the fight against tax evasion, as Mr Rehn has mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately, we need project loans on a suitable scale. We must provide the European Investment Bank with more funding. Of course, we also need to make better use of the Structural Funds. Finally, we also need something like eurobonds, because we must also reduce the cost of borrowing. This is a long-term project, but it is important for us to tackle the problems now.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of this does not put budget discipline at risk. On the contrary, it even gives us the option of achieving budget discipline earlier, if can put in place these measures to stimulate growth. When people ask what is happening with budget discipline in general, I can only say that we have the ‘six-pack’. In committee, the decision was made to introduce the ‘two-pack’. If the committee members held back in this area, this was because we wanted to add something specifically with regard to the subject of growth. In essence, we want to see growth and investment. I hope that we can reach an appropriate solution together here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I would like to say a few words on the subject of Greece. It is true that this is a difficult situation and we must be aware of all the democratic decisions being made in Greece. However, it is important for the Greeks to realise that they must decide for themselves whether they want to stay in or leave the euro area, but that this will, of course, have consequences for Europe. It is clear that reforms are needed in Greece and perhaps to an even greater extent than before. When there is a government in office which is prepared to implement these reforms, then we can talk about the necessary relief measures, in particular, with regard to social issues. We have been saying for a long time, including in this House, that not everything that the troika has proposed is socially just and acceptable. However, first there must be a government in place which commits to the reform programme in Greece and which is prepared to make tough sacrifices. Then it will be possible to negotiate with the government in order to introduce the relief measures which will ultimately result in Greece being able to balance its budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has repeatedly been said that the entire growth problem could lead to higher inflation and that is a social problem. What could be more unsocial than our current levels of unemployment? Our group believes that the most unsocial thing of all is unemployment and we must combat it by means of growth and investment.</p>

    <intervention id="2-367-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the summit tomorrow is the 18th special summit which has been organised since the start of the crisis in December 2009 – the 18th, and every time those organising these summits say ‘Yes, this is a final summit, it is an important summit, it is a summit where we shall tackle the real origins of this crisis’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only two months ago, you remember Mr President, in this room, there were a number of EU leaders who said that the crisis was behind us – that it was over – and they were wrong. They were dramatically wrong because this euro crisis started with Greece, a country that has an economy representing only 2% of European GDP, but today we are facing another crisis with Spain, which is the fourth economy of the eurozone, and with Italy, the third economy of the eurozone. Together they add up to something as big as the German economy, and these two economies, these two countries, are paying interest rates of more than 6% and we have spreads today of more than 500 basic points. That is today!</p>
      <p sl="de">So let us be clear: not only is this crisis not over, but it is not about Greece. It is not a crisis about Portugal; it is not a crisis about Ireland; it is not about Italy or about Spain. It is, in my opinion, not even an economic crisis or, indeed, a financial crisis. It is simply a political crisis that we face today in Europe, because our leaders today are unable to take the right decision at the right time. They are unable to create what we need, which is an economic and fiscal union alongside the monetary union, and the fact that the current situation is so dramatic is their responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">They have, in fact, transformed what was a small financial crisis in December 2009, involving just 2% of European GDP, into a crisis of unforeseen magnitude today. That is the main topic for a NATO summit. The euro crisis is a NATO summit topic today, and the other leaders of the world are pointing the finger at Europe. Why? Because three things are necessary but our leaders are not capable of deciding on them. First of all, we need a real economic and fiscal union. Secondly, we need to mutualise the debt with a redemption fund as quickly as possible if we want interest rates to go down for countries like Spain and Italy. Thirdly, we need a growth pact to relaunch the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">My plea today is not to the Council or to the Member States, whose interests the Council chiefly defends. My plea is to the Commission: it has the right of initiative. The ball is in the court of the Commission. Mr Obama is waiting for it; we are waiting for it; even Mr Cameron is waiting for it. What are you waiting for? That is my question today.</p>
      <p sl="de">My proposal is double. Firstly, I ask that the Commission should put on the Council table a proposal for a redemption fund because that will have a positive effect on the markets, and it will be impossible for even Ms Merkel to deny it or refuse it. Secondly, I am asking for a growth package to be put on the table. We know the various elements of that: increase the capital of the European Investment Bank; use the unspent money of the European funds; and launch project bonds – and that brings me to my final point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us be blunt: they told us that tomorrow they would announce project bonds as one of the instruments for economic growth – a proposal worth EUR 230 million. That is the proposal which is on the table today. But we need billions, Commissioner, not millions, and we need not a temporary solution, as they are discussing, but a permanent solution for growth in Europe. So my plea to the Commission is this: use the right of initiative that only you have, and put on the table tomorrow a real proposal for project bonds, a real proposal for a redemption fund and a real proposal for a real growth package for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the thing that shocked me most about the introduction to this debate was the tone in which people spoke about Greece. I hope that a different approach will be taken tomorrow at the informal summit from that in the initial speeches which I heard here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the desperate situation in Greece, which is a disaster in both political and economic terms, is primarily the result of a combination of two major problems. The first is a comprehensive failure of the state in Greece that has been tolerated for a long time and the second is an austerity programme imposed by the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which we have said right from the beginning was not feasible. The combination of these two problems, against the background of a very deep financial and economic crisis, not only in Europe but throughout the world, has resulted in the downward spiral which Greece now finds itself in.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are expecting you, Mr Rehn, and the representative of the Council Presidency to talk about this at the summit because we know that this downward spiral not only involves the Greeks, but could also pull in the citizens of other crisis countries or even the entire European Union, if the European Council does not finally get around to discussing the failings and weaknesses of the current crisis policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent days, we have read that there is a slow motion run on the banks under way in Greece. We know that if this goes on, Spain and Italy will also be affected. I would like to know why many Heads of State or Government are saying no longer only off the record, but also almost openly: ‘If the Greeks do not want to stay, then they should go’. I think this is a ridiculously irresponsible attitude. I believe that tomorrow, a decision must be made to allow the Greeks more time to stabilise their budget and their state.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Rehn, I also think the Commission must by now have reached the point that it can say tomorrow how the hundreds of millions of euro in Brussels which currently cannot be accessed by Greece can be used immediately to create jobs for young people in Greece and, for example, to fund the changeover to sustainable energy. It would be a clear demonstration of the EU’s shortcomings if tomorrow, everyone were to continue behaving as if they were helpless.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group believes that Greece must stay in the euro area and not only because we know that this is better for Greece, but also because we are convinced that it is better for the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If there are discussions about growth tomorrow, we hope that they will not once again concern, for example, the bubble which was almost directly responsible for leading Spain into its current crisis. If we talk about growth, then we must discuss sustainability, which can be achieved by means of consistent climate protection measures and energy and resource efficiency. We have spoken on numerous occasions about the fact that resource saving production processes and products are a guarantee for jobs not only today, but also in the future. The Commission is working on the assumption that between six and 10 million new jobs can be created in these fields by 2020. Where are the initiatives in these areas?</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of financing, I believe that we can achieve something with different areas of European funding, including the funds that we must now make consistent use of on the basis of policy requirements, and with the options available from the European Investment Bank (EIB). However, without similar investments on a national level and without promoting private investments on a large scale, we will not be able to achieve our objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that you can discuss growth tomorrow, but unless you talk seriously about how you plan to tackle the refinancing problem in Spain and in Greece and about the debt redemption fund and the prospects for eurobonds, then the growth pact that has been presented today will simply go up in smoke. We need a genuine fiscal union, a subject which has often been discussed in this House. As the chair of a group, I am slowly getting sick and tired of the feeling that speaking to the Council and the Commission is like talking to a brick wall.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are having yet another European summit. I make it the 22nd that we have had in the last two and a half years. Mr Verhofstadt said it was the 18th but it would not be the first time that he has got his numbers wrong!</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not know what else Mr Van Rompuy has done, but he has certainly been very good at calling summits. None of the others have made any material difference so why, we ask ourselves, should this one? The reason that they have all so far failed is that none of them has addressed the real problem which, of course, is the collapse of European competitiveness. I think all of us in this House have a common objective. We all, of course, want the old mantra of growth and jobs, yet we have very different views on how that should be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the socialists, across several groups in this House, only more government spending can create growth. I fundamentally disagree. The socialist vision of growth is an illusion created at the expense of borrowing and tax rises, and it is totally irresponsible in the current climate. As my favourite politician, Margaret Thatcher, once said, the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of everybody else’s money. We cannot afford a return to the discredited socialist growth agenda of Keynesianism dressed up as more investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Economic growth does not need state intervention. In fact, very often state intervention actually restricts growth. Take, for example, the Agency Workers Directive. This well-meaning piece of legislation, introduced through this House, has resulted in a fall in the number of temporary workers being employed in France. The Working Time Directive actually stops people from working. In a crisis, it is utterly immoral. So-called social protection legislation in the EU is failing to protect us from the worst social injustice of all, which is unemployment. We risk having the best protected workforce in the world, but no workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">More flexible labour markets are the way forward. EU leaders should ask which employment directive they can repeal immediately.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need, as others have said, a bonfire of red tape. Each piece of additional legislation acts like a pin in the body of our economy. It can survive a few, but eventually it will be killed by a thousand pinpricks. The Commission’s inertia-driven ‘better regulation’ agenda should be replaced by a politically driven deregulation agenda, and this Parliament can play a role here by spending more of our time considering how to repeal, refine and reform existing measures. The EU needs to do less and it needs to do it better.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have talked about what we can do less of. What can we do better? Commissioners, the answer lies in the letter signed by 12 Heads of Government. They sent you a clear set of ideas for extending the single market, for pursing free-trade agreements, for a European research area, and no end of good proposals. Sadly, the reaction from Presidents Barroso and Van Rompuy was disappointing. They continue to fall back on the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That agenda is lacking because it tries to be all things to all men. It contains some things to appeal to a liberal conservative like me, it has parts to appeal to socialists like Mr Swoboda, and even parts to appeal to a social democrat like Mr Verhofstadt. There are probably no parts that appeal to Nigel Farage, but then again the Commissioners are not miracle workers. Europe 2020 will not work unless it learns the lessons of the failed Lisbon strategy, which did not achieve its primary goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">My message to the Commission is this: we need a strong, free-trade, pro-competition agenda from you. At the moment, the Commission is effectively rudderless. The letter showed you the way forward and yet you disregarded it. The reform that the EU needs will not come about from one additional dinner, but tomorrow’s meeting can make an important start. It should give the Commission a clear message that it wants to see a free-trade, deregulatory and pro-market agenda. It should tell the Commission to go away and rethink the next seven-year budget so that every euro focuses on added-value outputs, rather than simply increasing national contribution inputs. Most importantly, it should place the single market at the heart of our economic recovery. Unless we resolve our competitiveness crisis, we will never resolve the many other crises facing the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">How many more dinners and summits will it take before we actually get some action that will make a difference?</p>

If I look at the pile of debt that exists in Europe, I see that British debts – public and private debt combined – amount to 500% of GDP. Right?</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the result of deregulation and basically of the recipes that you are lecturing all of us to adopt.

It was caused by a socialist Labour Government; it was caused by too much spending. Thankfully, in the UK, we now have a government that is actually taking some action to bring the deficit down, but I am afraid the problem lies over to your left, Mr Lamberts. Talk to the Socialists, they created the problem. The government which I support is helping to clear up that problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are in the midst of an economic and increasingly humanitarian crisis and yet Commission President Barroso is not here. Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.</p>

Clearly, I am not advocating that we move to a new fixed peg; I am advocating floating currency rates because history shows us that every time we try to fix currency pegs, we get it wrong. The risk, of course, is that the cost of imports would rise, which is why I said that what it would also lead to is innovation in Greece, as people started to make products to undercut the price of foreign imports. But I tell you what it would give: it would give Greece a chance, because stuck inside the euro you are going to be literally destroyed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I hear the solutions that have just been proposed, I can only say that this reeks of hypocrisy. On the one hand, we are being reminded, and rightly so, about the difficult social situation of the people who are suffering from the effects of austerity policies and, on the other hand, solutions are being proposed which will once again have an impact on the poorest of the poor. The only thing I can say in response is that the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the democratic majorities in the European Union should be protecting us from solutions of this kind, which are simply inhumane.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to look at the fact that measures have been imposed on the Greek Government for months which have led to greater poverty for its citizens. This is true and this is exactly what must be changed. The Greek economy is about to collapse even further under the weight of the austerity measures. In addition, the economies of Spain, Italy and other EU Member States are expected to shrink, despite stringent austerity programmes. Now the drastic cuts in public spending are to be accompanied by measures to stimulate growth. You yourself have also explained this on behalf of the Presidency. This involves promoting policies for growth and global competitiveness in conditions which include high levels of sovereign debt and ongoing crises. That is precisely the poisoned chalice which is being handed to these countries. It will not help to bring about a recovery or to put an end to the causes of the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not what is needed to bring about genuine sustainable and inclusive growth and to eliminate economic, fiscal and financial inequalities. The top priority for all investments must be to combat poverty and the destruction of the environment. Resource saving investments and a fundamental reorganisation of energy, industrial and agricultural policy and of the transport system are required, In other respects, I do not see any basic differences between this and the political platform of Syriza, which has been subject to such heavy criticism here in recent days and weeks and which has been described as if it were an extremist party. The question we need to answer is: what form should new negotiations take? We also need to ask ourselves whether all the accusations being made against Greece about the debts that it has run up are justified. Should we not carry out an audit or an evaluation of the debts and are new negotiations not urgently needed in this context?</p>
      <p sl="de">To summarise the situation, when we talk about growth, the Council should decide tomorrow whether it wants to use Ms Merkel’s growth model or to follow the course promised by Mr Hollande, for example, during the French election campaign. That is something quite different, with a focus on quality and not just on quantity. It is about really helping people and ensuring that economic growth benefits public interests. The economy is designed to serve people and not just to be an end in itself. Economic growth can only be discussed against this background.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy’s invitation to the informal summit tomorrow – a letter that comes to three pages – includes, right at the end, a laconic sentence, which I will now quote: ‘At the very end of our dinner, I propose that we discuss recent developments in the euro area’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It would be almost funny if the situation were not so serious. There is an elephant in the room, but if we all act as if there were not, maybe it will go away, or at least we will believe that it has gone. How can we talk about investments, economic growth and jobs without, at the same time, looking at these matters in the light of the euro crisis, which hangs like a sword of Damocles over the prosperity of the countries of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In recent weeks, we have heard another couple of odd pronouncements, for instance, from a European Commissioner who called a Greek exit from the euro area, and I quote, ‘the end of civilisation in that country’, no more and no less. It is precisely that kind of self-blinding that makes it impossible to achieve real solutions. Those solutions are not to be found in a blind leap to policies such as direct European taxation, community eurobonds or a European ‘redemption fund’, which would lay yet more taxes at the door of the net payers, and would only encourage irresponsible behaviour on the part of some net recipient countries. The result of this would be that the economic problems would only get worse.</p>

    <intervention id="2-378-000" speaker_id="1917" name="Markus Ferber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must put an end to a few of the fairytales that are often told here. Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses per se, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in February 2009, this Parliament adopted a report supporting the European Commission proposal to relaunch the European economy. It included projects on clean energy, transport, new technologies and innovation, and the role of the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds was already being weighed up then.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Over three years later, we have been able to produce the ‘six-pack’, the Euro Plus Pact, the fiscal compact and the ‘two-pack’, all of which are full of increased discipline and penalties. Meanwhile, however, unemployment – particularly youth unemployment – is reaching alarming levels, the European economy is going into recession and more than seven of the Member States are suffering negative growth. At the same time, while Greece is no more than a first tremor threatening to bring down the whole edifice, the relaunch agenda seems to have been forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The agenda is clear at the moment. Already, what is important at this point is not to make it a matter of urgency, but rather a matter of emergency, in a situation threatening to explode. There is an urgent need for intervention founded on a number of areas. First, a sort of European Marshall Plan needs to be established, with investment promoting growth, employment and convergence. Project bonds are one of the possible sources. Second, the interest rates at which countries are financed need to be stabilised. Let us prepare, at least, to coordinate the issue of sovereign debt and to manage jointly the debt accumulated. Third, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank (ECB) must be readied to act as proper firewalls for defending European sovereign debt. Fourth, the credit that the ECB transferred en masse to commercial banks must find its way to companies. There is EUR 1 trillion being held back in the banking system, while thousands of viable European companies go out of business every day because they lack finance. Fifth, investment makes no sense without demand. The weaker economies are being crushed under the weight of austerity packages. It is the stronger economies that need to free up domestic demand. Around 80% of trade now takes place within Europe, and it falls to the Commission, specifically Mr Rehn, to make recommendations directed not just at the weaker economies, but also at the more dynamic ones.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am concluding now, Mr President. Finally, there must be a limit to the measures imposed by the troika. We have gone far enough with the punitive style, without dialogue and without accountability, whereby high officials determine the fate of millions of Europeans and of Member States’ democratic institutions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I want to raise three points briefly. Firstly, some talk of financial stability and fiscal consolidation, while others talk of growth, pitting one against the other. In truth, we obviously need both. We need fiscal stability, we need to be back balancing the budgets and we need to support growth. It seems to me that this is a matter of common sense.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To sustain growth, here, too, we firstly need structural reforms, to regain competitiveness and, at the same time, invest in our future and give our children opportunities for the future. The fact is, Member States are unfortunately massively in debt and it is therefore up to the European Union to invest in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For that reason, I say yes to a massive increase, if possible, in European Investment Bank (EIB) capital, yes to eurobonds, but a substantial amount unlike the amount announced by the Commission. And why not yes to the mobilisation of European savings for future projects? I think this is an option that should really be opened up. Yes to a tax on financial transactions so that the EU finally has its own resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, as Guy Verhofstadt said, to provide opportunities for the future, we also need to think about how we can basically lower interest rates. Why not a new role for the European Central Bank (ECB) or pooling part of our debt?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, when Nigel Farage says anything here, it may make you smile, it is usually well put, but it usually has little impact. Yet when it is a colleague of Mr Rehn, namely Karel De Gucht, the European Commissioner, or a Governor of the European Central Bank, like Mr Coene, the President of the National Bank of Belgium, who starts rambling on in public, all innocent, saying no problem, Greece could leave the euro, I think this is more serious because these people are hugely responsible for what happened last week in Greece, when we saw the early signs of a bank run.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When you are a European policy maker, I do not think you should be behaving any old how with bar-room politics.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">What concerns me then, as it does many of you here, is Spain. Let us be clear. Of course, this summit meeting in Brussels tomorrow may be of use, but unless it comes up with a credible answer to what we should do to avoid financial collapse in Spain or Italy, we are failing to address the urgency of the situation. We do not have many options: either we ask the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy the debt – yet, it cannot do this because of European treaties – or we go back to the solution proposed at the time by none other than Mr Sarkozy, which would be for the European Stability Mechanism to become a bank which can lend to Member States or recapitalise the banking sector. I think this is a common sense solution, and it is time we looked at this again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, on the issue of growth, I would prefer to talk about investment. If we are to go about this, as mentioned in Spain yesterday, by building 40 airports, or today in Greece, by laying the foundations for new motorways, I think we are missing the point. Unless we introduce a programme of investment that makes Europe a world leader in energy and resource efficiency, we are wasting the one real opportunity for Europe to become a twenty-first century economic leader.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This should be our one and only driving force. It is not just about investing in bricks and mortar. It is about investing in education and research, investing in health care, all of which are factors of competitiveness, to coin one of your phrases. I think that is how we should go about it.</p>

Now it is growth of course, but unfortunately, we will achieve neither fiscal discipline nor growth in the atmosphere of uncertainty and unpredictability that we now have. Certainty and predictability: this is what we need most at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, this unpredictability and uncertainty is mostly caused by the wrong perception of the situation by the EU institutions, by the Commission and by Parliament, by us. Six months ago, Mr Barroso told me in this House that Greece would never leave the eurozone. Now even some Commissioners admit that this might happen and that Plan B is necessary for Greece. So what kind of assessment of the situation is that? It is just from one side to another.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that our institutions, unfortunately, have lost the ability to reflect public mood in the European Union because in hard times, as we have seen in France and in Greece repeatedly, people are looking at voting for strong national leaders to give responses to their problems. They do not care about us, they do not care about the Commission, they do not care about Parliament, and because of what? Because people are fed up with all that never-ending lunatic ideology of fiscal and political union that people like Mr Verhofstadt are still trying to sell, but no one is buying. People do not buy it any more so please let us stop talking about this nonsense. Let us be real. Let us deliver something real to the people, something we can do. Let us do our job. Let us, for instance, complete the single market and let us admit that fiscal discipline growth is mostly in the hands of Member States.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our youth’s prospects are dying of bureaucracy and its weapon of choice, red tape. Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Swoboda for his solidarity with regard to the recent tragedies in Italy and especially for the significance he attached to the problems we are dealing with: civil harmony and the possibility that, through solidarity and the possibility of development, we can build a different Europe and a different civil society.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development.</p>
      <p sl="it">The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since, at this European Council, we ought to be talking openly and putting all our cards on the table, it seems to me that the state of the euro area means we should be thinking about things in three stages: the short term being the urgency of the situation in Greece, the medium term being a strategy for growth and the long term our vision of the euro area and us ‘living together’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after two and a half years, the European crisis has brought us to a situation which Benjamin Franklin once described in his country as follows: ‘If we don’t hang together, by heavens we shall hang separately’. The question which both Ms Harms and Mr Verhofstadt have raised is: does Europe and does the EU have the steely political will in this situation to continue its strategy of working together to overcome major problems? I must say that, even if I ignore the anti-Europeans in this House, many of the remarks which I have heard here lead me to doubt that this is the case. For example, why does the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) give a long list of the countries she respects, simply so that everyone understands that Greece is not one of those countries? Why does Mr Ferber repeat his absurdly exaggerated call for budgetary discipline? We need budgetary discipline, but his own government is not doing at home what it is telling the rest of Europe to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">It depends on Parliament and on the Commission whether there is enough community initiative to come to grips with this crisis. It is not sufficient, Mr Rehn, to emphasise the less controversial issues and to highlight once again the commitment to growth and jobs which everyone shares.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two messages must come out of tomorrow’s summit. The first is the message to Greece. The path of reform must continue, but the mistakes which have so far been made must be rectified.

Mr Obama spent USD 800 billion on a stimulus package, the only thing he stimulated was the national debt. Growth is generated by competitiveness, by entrepreneurship, by risk capital and by a low tax burden. Precisely the things Mr Hollande dislikes. Therefore, he will not have his growth; he will bring about la portugalisation de l’Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are faced by a danger, and it is not our continent alone which is affected. The threat stems from the instability and uncertainty of the financial system, and it only needs one country to become unstable for all of us to be exposed to the real danger of economic chaos.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, before we make a scapegoat out of Greece, we should recall that it was not just Greek officials who helped in the falsification of data on its deficit, but also the banks that operate there, as well as the European officials whose duty it was to monitor and supervise the processes involved. Besides, Greece’s debt is chiefly the effect of the instability written into the structure of the single market and the euro area, the problem of the deindustrialisation of Greece from the moment it joined the Union and the problem of cheap credit. The continuing imbalance in the balance of payments in favour of Europe’s major economies could not have produced any other result.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is high time for change and to correct flawed policy. It is high time for a policy of growth. In this situation, it is important that we remember – and I quote here the words of the Polish economist Ladislau Dowbor – that to warrant workers better wages and rights is not demagogy; it is a more simple and straightforward way of generating demand and stimulating the economy. Investing in people is what enhances economic development.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need an answer to the question of why tomorrow’s informal summit is being held. Is it being held in order to diffuse the serious opposition to the extreme neoliberal policies being applied in the European Union? Is it being held in order to give false hopes and stop the spread of criticism and questions expressed by the results in Greece, France and, most probably, Ireland or is there an honest intention, which I cannot see, to bring about a sea change and hence a change of policy?</p>
      <p sl="el">We know that the leaders of the majority of countries are following policies of fiscal austerity and strict discipline which circumvent every democratic right and labour right. They are fanatically dedicated to that policy and that is the policy they will follow.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, we cannot expect a different policy from those leaders.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr Rehn, will we have to listen to yet more of the same about responsible and irresponsible political forces in Greece? Yet more of the same about uninformed Greek citizens? Let me assure you that Greek citizens, like European citizens, are informed and responsible. Neither your interventions nor the summits apparently called to discuss the question of growth will be able to divert them from the radical changes they want in order to create a Europe of cohesion, democracy and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">() Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, I will never get used to European Councils being prepared by the General Affairs Council, and I am disappointed that Mr Van Rompuy has not come to debrief us at this meeting, even if it is informal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Actually, Minister, the problem at hand does not come under the authority of the rotating Presidency. Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – Mr Hoang Ngoc, you are talking about taxes and collecting taxes. I am talking about public spending. The experts tell us that, in terms of public spending at each of the three levels, in other words, European, national and regional level, which includes local authorities, if we were to take a close look at our public spending, without touching upon the issue of sovereignty, if we were just to look at how we can make improvements to pool our expenditure, we could save billions and billions and billions, which could be used to reduce debts and to make investments. I am not talking about taxes; I am talking about making savings in public spending.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have one question for the Council and the Commission. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress.</p>

    <intervention id="2-404-000" speaker_id="28242" name="Alexander Graf Lambsdorff" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, there are three important issues for the summit tomorrow. The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my own constituency in Wales, youth unemployment is rising dramatically and women are losing jobs at an alarming rate, yet there is huge potential to build a thriving economy. We need an economy in which we can foster enterprise, combat inequality, create green jobs and support community and cooperative organisations. We need procurement models that are accessible to smaller businesses to help the local economy and create employment. We need to invest in improving housing, health and the environment: this will create millions of jobs and improve society.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, reality is confirming the disastrous consequences of so-called austerity. As in Portugal, unemployment is hitting historic levels and spreading, regardless of the rhetoric about growth and employment served up at the table of the European Union’s rulers at their informal dinners; the same dinners at which they applaud the virtuous policies of universal impoverishment, exploitation and penury whose imposition they are rolling out across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, it is not just the millions of unemployed: it is the millions and millions who are becoming more and more impoverished whilst working. This, in all its cruelty, is the true face of a project that promised harmonisation in progress, but coldly pursues the levelling down of living and working conditions in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This will not be resolved with words or tricks, such as so-called smart austerity or adding protocols to the new fiscal compact, attempting to legitimise that which cannot be legitimised. It will be resolved with a change of course and a profound shift in policy towards creating wealth rather than the wealthy; towards promoting progress and social well-being rather than steps backwards for civilisation.</p>

To achieve this, Europe must focus on the formation of fiscal policy measures that will ensure austerity as well as growth and job creation, but the European Central Bank needs, more than ever, to instigate a monetary policy that allows for the acceleration of the effects of the implemented structural reforms.</p>
      <p sl="es">The ‘policy mix’ is of key importance, today more than ever.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, now the figures more than the theories clearly demonstrate that not only has the austerity strategy failed to produce growth and employment, but that it does not even provide stability within the European Union, which was Ms Merkel’s main goal, given that public accounts are getting worse, not better. We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="it">The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun.</p>
      <p sl="it">Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund.</p>
      <p sl="it">These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioners, what I would like to say is very clear: naturally, the Portuguese Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) fully support any measures that might contribute to growth. There is no chance of emerging from this crisis without promoting growth, especially in those countries hit hardest by the financial crisis. However, when I hear some fellow Members here, I sometimes get the impression that they think growth can continue with excessive deficits and bad public accounts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must press ahead with the spending cuts and structural reforms. We can do everything possible on the growth side, but we cannot abandon the path of containing and reducing public spending and of structural reforms. More growth cannot mean being less careful and easing up: more growth and more growth policies must go hand in hand with greater rigour in relation to the public accounts and to structural reforms. If we just start talking about growth and thinking there are magic solutions to growth, we will end up back with unsustainable public debt and will carry on without the structural reforms.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That said, I should like to draw attention to the fact that tomorrow’s summit will not just debate the issue of long- or medium-term growth: the urgent issue of Greece will also be on the table and I consider it crucial that the Member States get behind Greece in some way. We are responsible for finding a solution to the Greek problem and I should like to repudiate here the statement by the British Member who spoke about the ‘Portugalisation’ of Europe. Perhaps the Portugalisation of Europe, in terms of values at least, would be no bad thing. I therefore reject this idea of trying, at bottom, to humiliate or belittle any people.

      <p sl="en">Still, I think that this important issue is going to be discussed very thoroughly because now the Commission has four tasks on its plate: to stabilise the eurozone, to introduce fiscal discipline and coordination, to stimulate growth and to help countries, like Greece, in economic distress. Sometimes the solutions to these problems are contradictory and controversial, so there should be a single and coherent policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before working out the new plan, however, we have to make an assessment of the previous plans. What happened with the EUR 5 billion economic recovery plan that was adopted in 2009? Recently, we understood that the money for it had not been spent. What happened with the final Fiscal Compact? I am not one of its fervent supporters, but it has not been ratified even by countries that were pushing for it. What happened with the Euro-Plus Pact?</p>

      <p sl="en">I am optimistic about the measures that the Commission has suggested and about which you, Commissioner Rehn, have informed us. But what is the value of a measure if it is not adopted and taken at the right time?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, the problem is not just that certain countries are in debt; it is the differences between them in terms of their growth model which has caused dissonance and cooperation problems in the institutions. The European Union, despite progress at Treaty level, reminds me of the Tower of Babel.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we need today is not stability from austerity alone or from growth alone, but from a combination of both. Of course a country in deep debt, such as Greece, needs a programme of spending cuts and numerous structural changes in order to boost growth.</p>
      <p sl="el">Yes, we Greeks have an obligation towards our lenders, but our current lenders are our partners. The Greek nation is aware of its obligations, but any nation in want that knows itself that its future is bleak can take desperate decisions in forthcoming elections. The history of Europe is full of similar examples, with tragic results.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, instead of maintaining or hinting that Greece is the problem and that it should leave the euro area, which no one in Greece really wants, let us all help to defuse the situation, ensure the problems are understood and find a balanced way forward, in keeping with the European economy and the social model. We can all utilise best practices from other countries, but theories about a ‘one size fits all’ model – such as the German model – are probably out of step with the inexorable truth. I doubt that tomorrow’s summit will generate any new ideas. Real solutions will need to overcome the entrenched attitude in the institutions.

This policy has sunk the country into depression, thereby preventing any prospects of growth. Every forecast has turned out to be wrong.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Union has been based on the Stability and Growth Pact. Both of these aspects have been mentioned today in the form of fiscal stability and economic growth. Unfortunately, this pact has not been observed and budgetary imbalances have been created, resulting in austerity measures. It is therefore obvious that there is no sustainable economic growth without financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, the austerity measures must be accompanied by measures promoting economic growth. Previous economic recovery programmes must be continued with specific measures. The Commission must propose programmes for supporting SMEs, also including loan guarantees or venture capital funds. The sums required can be provided by reallocating funds that have not been allocated or distributed so far.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Funds which have not been taken up for a variety of reasons must not be collected and returned to Member States, but redistributed to programmes supporting the economy. Ninety-five per cent of the EU budget is geared towards investment and generates economic growth and jobs. European policies and the European budget are obviously instruments which the European Union can use to intervene to support the economy. The regulations for the 2014-2020 common policies must include, to the maximum extent possible, measures for promoting growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 2014-2020 budget must be approved as soon as possible so that Member States can plan their national policies. It would be a good idea for Chapter 1 of the MFF to be approved as an initial step, which refers to cohesion, transport, education, research and innovation, ICT and jobs. We must promote new financial instruments such as ‘project bonds’, for instance. I believe that reaching an agreement on own resources would mark a big step forward, as this agreement would ease the pressure on national contributions.</p>

      <p sl="es">They have given off an air of being slow, inadequate and fragmented, given that they have not been able to establish either a plan or a narrative. A list of measures does not make a plan, and to achieve a plan and narrative that can be deployed over time, which does not impose unrealistic conditions in impossible timeframes, the call for growth should be given some substance, as it has become empty words. And to achieve that, all the available resources need to be mobilised: the financial stability mechanism, the balance of which has not yet been used, and also the Structural Funds, the balances of which are yet to be utilised.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, there is a need to clearly state that a fiscal agreement is not simply a budgetary corset to reduce costs, but rather to secure income, and this requires alleviation of the debt load, an increase in the European Central Bank’s firepower, and also the implementation of the European Treasury that issues eurobonds, which rationalise the partial sharing of Member States’ debts, currently called ‘sovereign’ debt. This also ensures the necessary income, via the innovation of the resources being discussed: the financial transaction tax, the all out fight against tax fraud and the eradication of tax havens.</p>

Let us hope that Hollande can show the leadership that Cameron, Merkel and Sarkozy have so dismally failed to deliver.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, two words have been repeated like a mantra during today’s debate: austerity and growth. Austerity and growth. In the meantime, we carry on at a crawl. Sometimes, though, the mighty Commission promises so much but delivers so little, as in the case of the EUR 5 billion for project bonds. Yes, you heard correctly. Here I am obviously talking not to this House, but to Europe’s citizens and businesses: EUR 5 billion for the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">EUR 5 billion divided among 27 countries. You do the maths. I am no expert on public works, but people tell me that with that kind of money, you can barely build a metro system for a single city. That seems rather too little on which to base a revival of EU infrastructure. What if we were to do more? What if we did not just let Member States dictate the rules? What if we tried to come up with some proper European bonds? What if we separated major public works from the Stability Pact?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to use the minute you have allocated me to draw the attention of the three Commissioners here today to one word. The word ‘desperation’. The desperation into which people are being pushed by austerity measures. Anyone who thinks that the issue stops there is making a mistake, because desperation makes people believe in demagogy, because desperation paves the way for all those who trade in hope, because desperation makes credible people out of liars, out of those who maintain that a country can stay in the euro area and keep the euro without honouring any of its commitments. I beg you to bear that in mind. Convey it to tomorrow’s informal Council, because it is important. It is perhaps an opportunity for the informal Council to adopt decisions of substance for the European Union.</p>

You could even say that the current Greek tragedy is a European tragedy and we will only be able to resolve it together or go under together, which I hope will not be the case. This means that we must act together and we must not abandon Greece or, most importantly, the Greek people. What Greece needs is not just growth, but a green investment pact. Only 3% of Greece’s energy supply consists of solar energy and billions are being spent on oil and gas. This is an area where jobs can be created.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another point to mention is the loopholes in the national tax systems. Mr Rehn has rightly said that two governments – my own government in Austria and the Luxembourg Government – are preventing progress from being made with the revised interest directive. This means that these two governments are supporting tax evasion and tax fraud. They are siding with the tax fraudsters and tax evaders. Therefore, I am calling on both these governments to agree to stop their blockade at the summit tomorrow.</p>

I would ask you, Commissioner, should we believe you, or should we believe Dr Barroso and Mr Trichet who said, I am not sure how many days ago, the exact opposite?</p>
      <p sl="pt">You mentioned keeping Greece in the euro and I would ask you, which euro? Is it the euro we currently have, in this euro area that we currently have, or is it the euro announced yesterday by Deutsche Bank, in a study mentioning a G euro? That would be a second-rate euro, in the event of the left winning Greece’s June elections. That is a con, Commissioner, the con of a Europe hostage to governments and the con of a Europe hostage to financial interests.

These voices testify to the fact that the crisis has not killed the fighting spirit in Europeans, and that we are still able to fight for a better tomorrow. I am pleased that the forthcoming informal European Union summit will concentrate on a policy of growth and employment. Most of the instruments for combating the crisis which have come into being recently focus mainly on disciplining national budgets, which, on its own, will not guarantee Europe either jobs or stable employment in the long term. Let us remember that budgetary discipline does not preclude measures for growth; quite the opposite – pro-growth measures should go hand in hand with austerity measures. It is only by acting in this way that we can restore secure growth to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The time has come for social investment, which should operate in a similar way to the economic ‘six-pack’, and should, with the consent of the Member States, be monitored by the European Commission.

      <p sl="nl">I advocate a different growth agenda, one that would increase opportunities for business: we should lower corporation tax, favourably write-off investments, provide sound and accessible education in top sectors and raise the pension age. The policy on the euro needs to be re-thought as well, and with no taboos. Lending more money, through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), for example, will only leave countries like Greece and Spain with bigger problems still.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, during this important debate, many of the honourable Members have touched on the single market, which finds itself – as I was saying yesterday – in a paradoxical situation. It is the first victim of the crisis, of unemployment, of the anxiety, despair and anger of many European citizens; yet, at the same time, it represents the main opportunity or asset in exiting the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make three brief observations on what we are doing to promote growth, and state, as many others have done, that we have felt for some time now that a growth initiative should be added to the fiscal and budgetary pact to ensure its success. Honourable Members, we have said this for some time and we are also taking action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say this to Mr Verhofstadt, beyond these walls. For many months, not weeks, the Commission has worked on and proposed what could – if the Heads of State or Government so desire – make up the substance of this growth initiative: ‘project bonds’, previously mentioned by Olli Rehn; the tax on financial transactions; as regards the single market, with your support and following on from the Monti report and the report by Louis Grech that you have adopted, 40 proposals are before Parliament and the Council of Ministers, all of which have a positive impact on the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises or on consumers; the European patent; which is actively supported by the Danish Presidency; e-commerce; simplification of procurement contracts; venture capital; mobility; social entrepreneurship; and professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next week, we will put forward a proposal on e-signatures, which should be one of the key areas in a very concrete issue, and which will perhaps enable us to make savings of EUR 100 billion each year. The issue in question is the digitisation of procurement contracts throughout Europe, then collective rights management. In a few weeks’ time, we will then put forward the second phase of the Single Market Act 2013, including 12 new proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, we must act now; vote on these bills with the Council and create the conditions, the ecosystem needed by businesses – particularly the smallest and medium-sized ones – and consumers for their activities, and for the investments mentioned by Mr Swoboda earlier, or the ‘green growth’ mentioned by Ms Harms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, honourable Members, we should go further and find once more the boldness that the founders of the European Coal and Steel Community showed at the very beginning of the European project. Imagine, for example, a European savings account that could take private savings and channel them to small and medium-sized enterprises, or laying the foundations of an industrial policy to protect those strategic technologies that we need to preserve our independence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point is this: Corien Wortmann-Kool spoke of the implementation process, and I would like to prove her right. We will put forward radical reforms of how the single market is governed and rigorously check that our laws are implemented by the EU countries in the partnership. However, there will be a zero tolerance policy at the end of the partnership, and we will propose to incorporate this governance of the single market into the European Semester. Priority will be given to the effective implementation of the Services Directive, to enable it to fulfil its full potential, and to the digital single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My final point, honourable Members, is this: what was to blame for growth stopping in Europe and throughout the Western world and the United States four years ago? It was the financial crisis – let us not forget this and neither the Commission nor Parliament will. It was the banks – some of which behaved irresponsibly, and it is clear that some bankers have indeed forgotten and have learned nothing – a lack of supervision, a lack of regulation and a gross distortion of free enterprise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, for governance, growth and the social market economy to succeed, I recommend that we have strong, sound foundations for the financial markets, which should serve the real economy and not themselves. With your support, and with the greatest determination, it is here, too, that the Commission fulfils its agenda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank you all for this very rich discussion and I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for highlighting the importance of the employment package which was announced from this position in the Chamber one month ago by President Barroso. Indeed, this package includes a number of initiatives on the demand for labour, on the need for more investment in skills, on the need for balanced labour market reforms and on helping mobility in the European Union in order to improve the situation and create jobs in the near future. It also includes action plans in three key areas, including green jobs, and we would like to work hand in hand with the Member States in order to implement this as fast as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to raise awareness of this and put it into practice, we will hold a European employment conference in early September which will be opened by President Barroso and President Schulz, and closed by President Van Rompuy.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many things we need to do in the area of employment, but top of the agenda is, of course, Youth. This is the biggest theme on which we have been working with the Danish Presidency i.e. the re-launch of the Youth guarantee programme. We are very active in reallocating EU Structural Funds (ESF) within the Member States which are most affected by youth unemployment in order to have projects that bring results faster and with greater efficiency. Together with Johannes Hahn, we went to the Member States on a number of occasions, including Greece, where there is a need for action and reinforcement of the implementation of the ESF. I can tell you that we managed to speed up the implementation of the Structural Funds in Greece with the help of the taskforce, but also in other countries like Romania – just to name a country which is outside the euro area but also in need of a lot of assistance in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">These efforts are very important. They are necessary but they will certainly be insufficient if we do not make progress with the macro-economic policies. That is why it is very important that progress is made in the coming weeks on the policies that Vice-President Rehn has championed, for example, putting forward the stability bonds which the Commission already did last October.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your many comments and proposals that I heard in the discussion, except for one, on the Thatcherite deregulation of the employment and social area in the European Union. I think this is a kind of obsession that has to be sidelined and we have to continue our work on the commitment to social rights, social cohesion and improving working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need many reforms in the labour market, for example, pension reforms that help people to work longer. However, in order to ensure that, we have to approach this with a readiness to invest more and also protect those people who suffer from the consequences of mass unemployment in the European Union at this time. I believe we can continue on this track to ensure that social cohesion prevails and, at the same time, improve competitiveness and overcome the financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me briefly thank you for a very substantive debate, and I share your sense of urgency to take decisive action to overcome the crisis and return to growth and job creation. That is our message for tomorrow’s informal summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also share the prevailing view of those who say that taking fiscal consolidation, on the one hand, and sustainable growth, on the other, and setting them against each other is really a false debate. Instead – in order to overcome the crisis and return to sustainable growth – we need to stay the course on fiscal consolidation while at the same time pursuing structural reforms which will enhance competitiveness, support the creation of more jobs and stimulate public and private investment that will give the needed extra fuel to our economic engine.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very grateful for your support for the EIB capital increase on project bonds for investment as well as for making more effective use of the Structural Funds. I also want to thank you for your overall support for a road map for stability bonds based on further reinforcement of economic governance – which is something that we have to reflect on and return to very soon and discuss together with the Member States and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make a point on Greece. It is important that the summit will reaffirm its commitment to safeguard financial stability in, and integrity of, the euro area. We are fully aware of the efforts already made by Greek citizens; we encourage Greece to continue fiscal and structural reforms while respecting existing commitments which are the best guarantee for a more prosperous future inside the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recipe of restoring confidence in public finances and undergoing consistent structural reforms does work. Countries that have best weathered the storm during the crisis are indeed those that have gone through this kind of adjustment in their recent past. Just look at Denmark and the Netherlands in the 1980s; Finland and Sweden in the 1990s; Germany in the last decade; and today Ireland – while still undergoing difficult adjustment – has returned to recovery and growth. The Baltic States have recovered and we forecast three and half to four per cent economic growth for them next year. So it is indeed possible through this recipe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to conclude by saying a few words on the quality and fundamental nature of growth. We have made – and continue to do so – growth and employment an absolute priority. Not just any old growth, however! Not growth that only entails injecting public money, in accumulating more debts and in sweeping our economies’ structural problems under the carpet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There will be no sustainable growth without healthy, and thus sustainable, public accounts. There will be no sustainable growth unless structural reforms are implemented and our competitiveness and ability to create jobs are improved. There will be no sustainable growth without the completion of the single market. Finally, there will be no sustainable growth unless further effort is made to attract private and public investment in growth sectors where jobs are being created, such as research and innovation, energy and the green economy, and transport and communication infrastructures. The aim of our agenda is to support sustainable growth, employment and investment.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioners, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like to express my thanks for a good debate, with strong views and constructive input. It is abundantly clear that we all share a desire to increase growth and employment in Europe. The commitment shown in the debate today clearly proves this. Europe is in a severe economic crisis. Public budgets are in deficit, growth is poor and unemployment is high. Millions of young people in Europe are looking to this Parliament, looking to the Commission, looking to the Council, hoping that they can use their talents in the real world, and it is our job to give them that opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="da">We need a response to the crisis. This response must focus on three elements: firstly, securing the stability of the European economies; secondly, regenerating growth; and finally, implementing structural reforms. Sound public finances are undoubtedly a central element of putting the Member States’ economies back on track for growth, which is vitally important for realising the potential of these economies. Nonetheless, I must stress that a strategy that does not also deliver on growth and jobs will not be capable of steering our Union out of the crisis. This is the reason why the jobs and growth dimension are so high on the Union’s and the Presidency’s agenda. At the same time, however, it is absolutely key that this entirely necessary growth policy is not made in a way that creates instability. It is therefore essential that the growth policy does not result in large public deficits. It is now up to the Member States to show the same commitment to the growth agenda as they have already demonstrated in relation to the consolidation agenda.</p>
      <p sl="da">Increased growth and jobs are, as I have said, a top priority for the Danish Presidency. This was a focal point of the European Councils in January and March, it is a focal point again at this week’s extraordinary European Council, and it will also be a focal point of the last European Council under the Danish Presidency. Creating jobs and growth is the Danish Presidency’s top priority. However, as others have also pointed out in the debate today, economic stability and consolidation are a precondition for achieving growth and employment, not a contradictory aim. We are already working in a number of areas, and the Presidency is pleased to have the cooperation of the Commission and the European Parliament. Where this Parliament is concerned, we are already cooperating closely on matters such as the internal market, the directive on energy efficiency and the EU’s multiannual financial framework. We now need to look at what further steps we can take together. Ladies and gentlemen, I am also pleased to be able to tell you that an agreement on project bonds has just been concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This shows that we are all prepared to get down to business. The ball is now clearly in our court. The unemployed of Europe will show no patience if we do not do everything we can to deliver the goods. That is why we share a common task, regardless of which country we come from, regardless of which party we represent, regardless of whether we are members of the Commission, of Parliament or of the Council. Let us rise to this task together.</p>

Some Member States have been setting a good example in this regard, including the Netherlands of late. Measures to promote growth certainly can have a positive impact on the economy and the number of jobs, but not as a result of spending more government money, which increases deficits. They do so through bringing about reform and cutting unnecessary red tape, including at European level, and by collecting tax effectively and managing the available funds better and more intelligently. I ask the Council to establish ambitious targets in these areas at its informal summit. That way, growth and employment can be promoted without running up the deficits.</p>

Such a Grexit could develop into an incalculable chaos in Greece, with unstable or extremist parties coming to power. That could totally destabilise the south-eastern flank of the Union and could ultimately result in armed conflict. What is a more, a loss of face on such an epic scale would also represent the ultimate proof of the powerlessness of European structures and their leaders to take the right decisions in precarious circumstances to calm everything down. Greece represents scarcely 3% of the GNP of the EU. The Greek issue is thus, by definition, manageable. The EU needs to take over the management of the Greek debt more quickly, as we are proposing with the debt redemption fund. In this way, we will be giving the affected population (the Greeks, but also the Spanish, the Portuguese and so on) prospects once again, as well as a guarantee that the EU will not leave them in the lurch. There is no other way. Europe’s leaders, the Commissioners at the head, need to stop making noises about a Grexit.

This is not the time for us to be exposing our differences and getting bogged down in national self-interest. Solidarity and vision are what we need. Narrowing the disparities between European states in terms of development can be an important driving force for future economic growth. A lack of action in this area incurs higher costs than those for returning to economic growth.

They should have these goals in mind when they adopt measures and not only at a pan-European level. The growth deficit in Europe represents a serious threat to our future and, at this moment, we have to fight together with the aim of helping Europe recover from the crisis. We will not achieve growth and employment by means other than cooperation and investment. Growth and job creation depend on healthy and well-connected markets in which competition and consumers stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation; the European Union must become a more attractive place to invest. Let us not forget SMEs, which are the driving force behind the European economy, and let us also not forget scientific research, which is essential for the growth of productivity. Cuts alone will not help us overcome the crisis. They mainly affect the most vulnerable EU citizens, who are ultimately those who are most affected by the crisis, and we should combat this crisis in the spirit of modern social democracy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Most EU Member States are experiencing a slowdown, standstill or, in several cases, even a decline of economic growth; Hungary is among the latter. Twenty-five million people in Europe are unemployed; in Greece and in Spain, half of all young people are unable to find employment, while in most other Member States, the figure is one-fifth.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is a sad fact that the next generation is increasingly seeking to find its livelihood outside Europe. One-sided austerity measures that are not accompanied by economic invigoration have a serious impact on all strata of society except a narrow group comprising the wealthiest. Disappointment, hopelessness and social exclusion all work in favour of radical forces, as demonstrated by the results of the latest elections in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Opinion polls often show increasing support for populist and radical forces. The alarming facts and data before us prove that the crisis management efforts made so far were unsuccessful. If the Greek elections in June do not end in majority support for forces friendly towards Europe, we could be facing a disaster. This Mediterranean country could take the Member States on Europe’s periphery, as well as the Central and Eastern European region, down with it. It is finally beginning to dawn on Member State governments that have so far rejected the solutions long advocated by the left wing that in order to avert an even greater disaster, in addition to responsible fiscal policy, we also need economic invigoration measures, an intensification of European integration, the realisation of solidarity and the elimination of the internal imbalances in the euro area. The participants of the summit on Wednesday will finally need to decide on the specific steps to be taken in order to achieve all this.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The financial and economic crisis hit Member States’ public finances, which was accompanied by a serious blow to the EU’s economic growth. Last year, the European Parliament adopted, along with the Council, a package of measures for tightening economic management, whose aim is to discipline countries and improve the management of their public finances. This unquestionably improves coordination and has a positive impact on the EU’s stability as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, we saw that this was not sufficient for us to emerge from the crisis. Fiscal discipline needs to be accompanied by measures to stimulate growth and establish the preconditions for creating new jobs. In this regard, we must focus particular attention on small and medium-sized businesses which have been hard hit. However, the difficulty in accessing funding and the long-winded procedures are only some of the problems facing business nowadays. The financial instruments developed by the European Commission must play an important role in supporting SMEs. However, in order to make them effective, an adapted approach is required to include indicators for assessing the results, as well as greater transparency in terms of the programmes’ operation. In addition to this, the functioning of the single market needs to be improved and the administrative burden needs to be reduced, especially for SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The French presidential elections and the recent changes of government in Denmark, Slovakia and Romania signify a political turning point, an advance of the left wing. The question is whether this will be accompanied by an economic turning point. Will the European Union finally discard its conservative economic policy which focuses solely on deficit reduction?</p>
      <p sl="hu">The situation in Greece, as well as the difficulties facing Spain, Portugal and Ireland, clearly show that austerity measures alone are not enough. There is only so much European society can endure, yet the elimination of deficit would require years or even decades. We must find a new economic model, an alternative to the free-market capitalism that caused the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is worth mentioning the reason why Scandinavian countries were able to withstand the crisis effectively. These countries finance their broad social benefits from high taxes, while their financial and banking systems are subject to strict rules. European countries must turn their attention towards investments that serve long-term growth, such as infrastructure and energy network modernisation, research and development, the elimination of abject poverty and the development of education. The costs of such investments should not be disregarded during deficit calculations for the Stability and Growth Pact. European project bonds should be introduced to finance investments that facilitate growth.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The informal EU summit to be held on 23 May is devoted to investment, economic growth and job creation. On this occasion, Heads of State or Government should identify and devise new policies in support of economic growth in the EU. During the summit, special attention must be focused on measures for creating new jobs, especially for young people among whom the unemployment rate has passed the 20% mark. On the subject of the Structural Funds, they should be channelled into making Member States more competitive and increasing economic and social cohesion. Member States with a poor rate of absorption should be given help to speed up the use of the Structural Funds in areas and projects helping create new jobs. Given that, in recent years, industrial production has declined in many of the Member States, with a powerful impact on jobs across the EU, I think that the EU should make better use of strategic partnerships with third countries for acquiring their raw materials and supporting industrial production across Europe, as well as the EU’s exports and economic interests. We call on the EIB to concentrate on supporting SMEs and infrastructure projects, particularly in the transport and energy sectors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, just like racism and sexism, homophobia is a blemish on European values, threatens the principle of equality, undermines the spirit of tolerance and diversity and blights the lives of victims. Therefore, the Council stands alongside Parliament today in the fight against it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to be constantly vigilant in combating discrimination. This is about defending and putting into practice the values we have enshrined in the UN Charter and human rights instruments such as the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, in Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in EU legislation. This is not only about sexual orientation and identity. It is about freedom, including the right to speak freely, to march, to demonstrate and to express oneself in public.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a legislator, the Council has already taken steps to protect European citizens against discrimination. The Council directive on establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation is an important one. It prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, as regards employment and occupation. Thus, it is already illegal for employers to discriminate against someone just because they happen to be gay – or indeed heterosexual – but, of course, discrimination does not take place only at work. European citizens also expect to receive equal treatment at school, when seeing a doctor, when renting a house and so on. No one should suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation. No one should face harassment and bullying.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is currently examining a Commission proposal for a new directive that would extend protection against discrimination to areas outside employment – areas such as social protection, health care, education and access to goods and services, including houses. As you know only too well, the negotiations on this proposal have not been easy. The Council has been examining the text since 2008. We need all Member States to agree before we can adopt this act. However, the work continues and the Danish Presidency will be presenting a progress report to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in June.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legislation is, of course, the bedrock of human rights and equal treatment, but it can never be enough in itself. Another tool at our disposal is awareness raising. Changing attitudes is a long-term process, and I recall with satisfaction that five years ago, the values shared by the Council and the Parliament were given embodiment in the 2007 Year of Equal Opportunities for All, which was set up to remind our citizens that all people are entitled to equal treatment irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to continue this work. The Fundamental Rights Agency is deepening our understanding of discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the EU also seeks to project its values in the wider world through its external actions. The European Parliament keeps a vigilant eye on this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">A glance at the newspapers is enough to confirm that homophobic incidents are still all too common in Europe and beyond. The European Parliament plays a crucially important role in defending sexual minorities who are not adequately protected by politicians and the law. The EU has led the world in affirming lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people’s rights and we must continue this process together. This is a shared responsibility of this House, the Commission and the Member States, and it is a shared responsibility for all our citizens in the EU.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-447-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, last week, on 17 May 2012, we celebrated the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. On that occasion, I made a statement on behalf of the Commission, and I would like to reiterate here, in front of the elected representatives of the European citizens, that homophobia and transphobia are an unacceptable violation of human dignity and that they are completely incompatible with the founding values of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission is fully committed to combating this phenomenon with all the powers at our disposal. As Vice-President in charge of fundamental rights and non-discrimination, I have the task of ensuring that the principle of equal treatment remains valid everywhere and for all. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across the EU are still victims – victims of exclusion, hate speech, hate crime, discrimination and intolerance. We all know that, and we also know that our basic texts, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, prohibit any discrimination based on sexual orientation. As explained in the recently adopted annual report on the application of the Charter, the Commission ensures that this principle is respected in every EU action and by Member States when they implement EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Discrimination based on sexual orientation is also prohibited in our directives, for instance, in the directive on employment. The Commission has made a legislative proposal to extend this prohibition to cover access to goods and services, social protection and education. I agree with the Presidency that it is unfortunate that this text is in an impasse in the Council, and I look forward to the report the Presidency is to prepare on its efforts to move forward on it. Unfortunately, this text needs unanimity in Council and that is the reason why it is blocked, but it is clear also that there is a vast majority of Member States who would back it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not only do we have laws in place but the Court of Justice has also confirmed several times in its rulings that the directives on gender equality in employment and access to goods and services also prohibit discrimination based on gender reassignment. So, with regard to the legal basis, we are very clear: there is no doubt what the legal foundations are.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of that, of course, you have to stay vigilant, and the Commission remains vigilant, following up closely every petition and parliamentary question that alerts us to discriminatory practices on grounds of sexual orientation, whenever they concern matters falling within EU competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hate crime against LGBTI persons remains a source of concern, as shown by the recent homophobic murder of the young Belgian, Ihsane Jarfi. That is also why the Commission has asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to conduct a specific survey on hate crimes and discrimination against LGBTI persons in all Member States and in Croatia, because we need to have evidence – not only the evidence once a crime has happened, but also a mapping of where crimes happen in order to understand more about the trends in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel, the Commission is continuing its awareness-raising actions across Europe in order to fight discrimination and to promote equality and diversity. In particular, as you know, we support civil society organisations and national authorities in combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we do in Europe, we also do outside Europe. The External Action Service is very much aware of the difficulties faced by the LGBTI community in third countries like Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, to mention only those in which we find not only discrimination and violence but also criminalisation. The EU has repeatedly condemned such measures and repeatedly called on the authorities of those countries to respect their international legal obligations on human rights, including the principles of equality and dignity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind you that Cathy Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, condemned homophobia in her statement on 17 May 2012 and called on governments to apply human rights equally, irrespective of sexual orientation or gender identity. And every time she visits a country outside the EU, she recalls these principles in very strong language.</p>
      <p sl="en">As EU Commissioner for Justice, I will continue here in Europe to do my utmost to uphold the fundamental rights upon which the European Union is founded, not only on the International Day against Homophobia, but on every day of the year, because homophobia has no place in Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-448-000" speaker_id="28120" name="Simon Busuttil" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is no doubt that the EPP Group condemns homophobia and we believe that homophobia must be fought. We have consistently made that clear and we are taking this opportunity to repeat it once again this week. In Europe, there is no room for discrimination of any kind, and that includes homophobia.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are no two ways about this. Earlier today, all the political groups of this Chamber sat down together around one table to draw up a common resolution, in order to be able to speak against homophobia with one voice. Since this issue stirs up a great deal of emotion and controversy, the EPP wants to keep the debate focused on the real issue: that is, homophobia. Otherwise, it will be impossible to find common ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, the EPP would like to raise two points. Firstly, we must clearly keep in mind the limits of our competence: that is, what we can do and what we cannot do. We must respect the principle of subsidiarity, which is a basic principle of the European Union. This means that matters that are within the competence of national governments should be left to be handled at national level. Secondly, we must avoid condemning individual countries, especially in cases where it is not the government of a particular Member State that is responsible for a given initiative or incident.</p>
      <p sl="en">Homophobia is unacceptable and we have to make sure that it is eradicated in Europe and beyond, but to do this in an effective manner, we must be credible, we must make sober, rather than emotional, assessments, and we must respect the limits of our mandate. Most of all, we must speak with one voice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the contribution from Mr Busuttil. I hope that we can all, as one house, vote in favour of denouncing homophobia. Homophobia blights and destroys lives; it destroys the lives of those who actually practice it, as well as those who experience it. Hate crimes, homophobic crimes and transphobic crimes scar our continent. As Madam Reding said, that young man in Brussels died for the simple reason that he was a homosexual.</p>
      <p sl="en">The laws being enacted in Moldova, in Ukraine and in Russia are a step backwards. They are not a step forward towards understanding and celebrating diversity or people, but rather a step towards saying that, in order to have the protection and the respect of States and institutions, you must conform to a very narrow stereotype.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, it makes absolutely no sense. Two twins born to proud parents grow up looking the same, behaving the same, but one wishes to declare that she or he is homosexual and the other heterosexual. For that simple reason, the child that was loved and protected by that state and by its institutions is immediately denied the equal protection and support of the state. They are even denied education that tells them that it is indeed okay to be who they truly are and that others in history have been exactly the same. There are people in the European Parliament and other parliaments, and Presidents and Prime Ministers. But no, we suffocate people with oppression and take away information and education that can help them become the unique individual that they were born to be and the unique individual that deserves to love and to be loved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, Mr Busuttil, I absolutely agree with you that we must respect the limits of our competence. I do not want us to start amending what we have agreed, but we must not limit our aspirations for other Member States. That is extremely important. I do think that if we do not name these countries, we cover them in a cloak of anonymity and we encourage others to join them by bringing in laws which are homophobic and which seek to treat people unequally.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, let me finish on this. I can see at least one person sat in this House who has experienced homophobia. I too, as an openly gay man, have experienced homophobia, but very, very rarely. Why? Because I was given the benefit of a family and a society and education that supported me so that I could become who I am and to be proud of who I am. That aspiration and that opportunity must be given to every individual of the European Union and beyond. Thank you for your indulgence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the previous topic here was the eurozone crisis and setting up the stability mechanism. We have a rescue fund, and I was just wondering: should we not perhaps give a tax discount to LGBT people? They represent 5 to 10% of the European population, they contribute to our economy, to the rescue fund and to bailing out countries in the eurozone, and yet they do not get the same rights as other EU citizens. They do not get the same protection and services from their governments, so perhaps we should not ask them to pay the same.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am being a bit ironic as that, of course, is not the solution. The solution is that we start, at both EU and Member State level, to give the same protection and the same rights to all EU citizens. It is time for the European Union to deliver. I am actually very glad and proud to be a member of this House, which has really become a champion of LGBT rights, and I very much welcome the first ever resolution dedicated to homophobia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Busuttil, I very much welcome the support and the cooperation of the EPP Group, because I think that the cross-party support for this resolution sends a very strong signal to our own countries’ governments as well as to the governments of the countries mentioned: Russia, Moldova and the many other countries which treat LGBT people very badly. My final point is about the hate speech of opinion leaders, political leaders and religious leaders. That is not innocent and not innocuous. It contributes to a climate of hatred, intolerance and violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say – also to Mr Busuttil – that discrimination is not necessarily less bad than homophobia. If we tolerate discrimination and unequal treatment, we send a signal that some people are less equal than we are, and that justifies homophobia. So, colleagues, I ask everybody to wholeheartedly endorse the resolution tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, less than a week ago, it was the International Day against Homophobia, and we celebrated here in the European Parliament with a video message made by many of us here including some of the Commissioners – Ms Reding and others – telling young people in Europe especially that: ‘It gets better’.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a lesbian woman myself, and one who has lived through times when things were not, at least in some parts of this continent, as easy as they are now, I know how it is to live a life of fear, of being afraid of walking hand in hand with your loved person in the streets, or of kissing her or him goodbye at the train station.</p>
      <p sl="en">Homophobia is about fear, as it states in our text. It is an irrational fear of, and an aversion to, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, based on prejudice and similar to racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism and sexism. It is something that we should all condemn, and we should make sure that people do not have to be afraid of living their lives to the full, which includes a happy love life. Much as things have improved in many parts of this continent, there is reason for serious concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been mentioned, in some countries outside the EU – Ukraine, Russia and Moldova, for example – there are people, sometimes in government and sometimes outside it, who try to put laws into practice that prohibit any kind of public discussion of homosexuality. Visibility and public speeches are so important, especially for young people who are coming out and want to be open and out and proud of what they are.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is up to us here, at all levels of the European Union, to speak out against homophobia, to condemn it clearly, to make strategies – to make a road map, Ms Reding – to fight homophobia and to pursue equal rights for lesbians and gays, in order to make sure that, as you advocated, homophobia is condemned on this continent, and is not something that any one of us supports.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, as George Weinberg once said: the roots of homophobia are fear, fear and more fear. As people begin to fear for their economic security, it is important that we do not allow those fears to grow and manifest themselves in discrimination or in the dehumanisation of any group of people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our progress towards building a more tolerant society should not be allowed to go into reverse gear. Of course, we all have different views as to what role the EU can play. Personally, I believe that the EU has a limited role in social policy, but it is a stark reality that some European nations have moved faster towards equality. And let us not forget that many started their journey a long time after others.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I believe that it is important that we stand united today to say that it is a fundamental value of our continent that all people deserve humanity, dignity, personhood and rights, regardless of their sexual orientation.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, last Saturday, I took part in a debate with Hungarian journalists and politicians in Amsterdam. One of the areas of concern related to the law restricting the definition of a family to a heterosexual family. That law instantly gives off a signal on the part of the Hungarian Government that it stands on the side of the homophobes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In more and more Eastern European countries, laws are making it impossible merely to talk positively about lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) issues in public or even to hold gay pride festivals. The very governments that are now promoting homophobia really should be providing a positive lead. LGBT people need good role models, such as politicians who dare to publicly stand up for their sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">During the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHO) last week, we all believed that things were getting better. The reality is that, in many European countries, things have, in fact, only got worse, and it is therefore incumbent upon all of us to ensure that things really do improve. By supporting people who dare to stick their necks out in a chamber less safe than this European Parliament, and by saying the truth to those governments that support homophobia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Vice-President Reding, we can only tackle governments of this kind if we also have our own house in order in the European Union. I am therefore disappointed by your answer to my written questions, in which you said that you do not plan to bring forward measures to recognise full equal rights for same-sex couples if they take advantage of their freedom of movement.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply concerned by recent developments in certain European countries relating to restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly that are based upon an erroneous conception of homosexuality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Homophobia continues to manifest itself in Member States and third countries, taking different forms, such as violent public speeches and even murder. Laws have recently been brought in or passed against ‘homosexual propaganda’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot turn a blind eye to these situations. We should call on the relevant authorities in these countries – Russia, Ukraine, Moldavia, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary – to ensure that the principle of non-discrimination is respected and to reconsider these laws, bearing in mind international human rights legislation and their own commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission, the Council and the European External Action Service (EEAS) should take note of these bans and take appropriate action in the context of home affairs, bilateral dialogue and the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is regrettable that, even within the European Union, the basic rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are not always fully respected. We can only strongly condemn any discrimination or incitement to hatred or violence on the basis of sexual orientation. Moreover, homosexual children should have access to positive and reassuring information about their sexuality. These laws make it difficult and illegal to access such information, which is disastrous for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, we celebrated for the seventh consecutive year the International Day against Homophobia, but can we honestly now say ‘it’s getting better’? Even if we can congratulate ourselves on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, news stories tell us that we still need to stand firm in our fight against the violence and discrimination that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people face in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In far too many countries around the world, national and regional governments enact laws that criminalise what is termed by them as propaganda promoting homosexuality. In far too many countries around the world, living as a homosexual or expressing oneself in a gender that differs from the one recognised at birth can be life-threatening. This, in itself, fully justifies the need for those affected by such situations to be granted access to international protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sadly, the path to equality, in our countries, is still a long one, but we should stay on the right path as LGBT people are all too often the target of unacceptable stigmatisation and sometimes violence. Cases of suicide among LGBT teenagers are also signs warning us of the urgent need for action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To stem the tide of discrimination on a long-term basis, directions must be followed. They could be divided along three lines: firstly, and this forms the foundations, by educating children from a very early age to respect others through school curricula that aim to confront prejudice, representations and sexist and homophobic stereotypes, next by offering gay couples equal rights to marriage and adoption, and I am pleased to see that the new government in France has pledged to carry out this reform, and lastly by legally sanctioning homophobic and transphobic insults in the same way as racist insults.</p>

I cannot claim that all of the credit for this belongs to the coalition government of the last two years, as we are of course building on previous work, Mr Cashman.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, one clear new development which we are taking forward is equal marriage. I agree, of course, with Mr Busuttil that family marriage laws are a national responsibility, but there is an EU dimension when a gay married couple moves to another country where they lose their civil status and legal rights, including parental rights. But for all too many LGBT people in Europe, and even in the EU, the discrimination and prejudice they face is crudely homophobic, nasty and brutish, to the point not only of hate speech, but violence and murder.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, like others, strongly welcome the support of the EPP under the leadership of Simon Busuttil for this resolution. The progress we have made in Britain is based on cross-party agreement. It is not so long ago that we had a law against the so-called promotion of homosexuality, known colloquially as ‘Section 28’, and now we are on the verge of equal marriage.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I would like to say to Ms Ludford that our group will not decide until this evening whether it will support this resolution. As I listen to today’s debate, I am starting to think that we will not be supporting it for the following reason. I am a strong opponent of homophobia and a strong supporter of human rights. However, there are no LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights. I think this is nonsense. It is just ideology. There are human rights and, of course, we must fight for human rights, including those of homosexuals, and we must ensure that they are not discriminated against. This is why we have an anti-discrimination paragraph in our Treaty, anti-discrimination legislation and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">In cases where this legislation is not complied with, and I do not know of any such cases in the EU, then of course it is necessary to take legal proceedings. This can and should be done. However, that is not what we are talking about. We have been speaking here the whole time about so-called gay marriage. You may be in favour of it or you may be opposed to it, but that has nothing to do with human rights and nothing at all to do with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter explicitly states that every Member State is free to decide how it defines marriage and the family. This was specifically included in the charter to enable states such as Germany and many others, including Hungary, to say that marriage is a contract between a man and a woman. That is a right which is specifically guaranteed in our Charter of Fundamental Rights. You cannot lump that together with homophobia. You can criticise it in political terms, but you cannot link it with dreadful events like those instigated in Russia by Mr Putin, which I also condemn.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the last part-session in Strasbourg, I warned this House about the ideological misuse of human rights. Human rights are too precious to be lumped together with socio-political propaganda. For this reason, I am horrified at the tone of many speakers in today’s debate. I am opposed to breaches of human rights, I am opposed to homophobia, but I am also opposed to ideological propaganda.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ensuring gay rights is among the fields where we have a great deal of work ahead of us; we are missing a horizontal anti-discrimination directive that would broadly ensure non-discrimination. Same-sex couples are not guaranteed the freedom of movement within the EU, as the mutual recognition of their civil status is not a given. European-level action against hate speech and hate crimes is also absent, even though this is also considered an important aspect by the relevant recommendation of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, in addition to an appropriate legislative environment, it is crucial that we ensure actual non-discrimination, and to this end we must create a social environment that is characterised by tolerance and respect for diversity. There is a lot of work to be done in this field throughout Europe, and the role of politicians, the media and education is exceedingly important.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Many here have mentioned Hungary. On the one hand, Hungary can be proud to have the eighth most favourable legislative environment for anti-discrimination in the EU. On the other hand we can see that for the second time, the police attempted to outlaw the Hungarian day of Gay Pride, Budapest Pride, and that Budapest Pride participants needed police protection against radical counter-demonstrators, while the city’s leadership is attempting by all means to prevent the Euro Gays event from taking place. Thus, we are seeing an ambiguous picture, and political rhetoric often reinforces precisely those attitudes that we would like to avoid.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are many tasks ahead of us: the Commission should monitor the implementation and transposition of directives on discrimination, and we would like to ask it to investigate the implementation of European Union legislation against hate crimes. The Council should adopt the horizontal anti-discrimination directive, while Member States should make extensive efforts to create an inclusive environment through education, raising awareness, and closer dialogue with civil organisations.</p>

It is clear that there cannot be such cooperation in the Hungarian Parliament, precisely because the position of the Jobbik party is utterly unacceptable to the Socialist faction, and not only on the matters we are discussing at the moment but on other points as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What I am seeing, in fact, is that it is the Fidesz government that very often moves closer to extreme views. It is members of the Fidesz government that are trying by all means to prevent the Euro Gays event from taking place, and it was precisely under their term that the police banned the organisation of the day of Gay Pride. There had been no precedent for this in the past. I could say many other things, but I believe my time has, unfortunately, run out.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, in my view, the rights of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are a much more important subject for discussion in the European Parliament than milk quotas, with reference to Astrid Lulling’s point of order yesterday. Mr Busuttil, we definitely must be emotional! People in the European Union are being abused and unfairly treated every day, simply because of who they love or who they are. They are being oppressed, discriminated against, mistreated and even killed. It is tragic that in 2012, we have not made more progress on this issue in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">An important discrimination directive is cluttering up the drawers in the Council’s desk because there is opposition to the issue of LGBT people’s rights within the Council. Hungary has a new constitution which states that marriage is the prerogative of a man and a woman. In Lithuania and Latvia, there is a proposal for legislation banning information on homosexuality.</p>
      <p sl="sv">One of the simplest words to understand and one of the best words in the language is the word ‘family’. In the EU, we have the free movement of citizens, including families, but not for everyone. The EU’s definition of a family is not in line with reality. That is highly deplorable, because one of the fundamental pillars of EU cooperation is human rights and this includes the rights of LGBT people. We must put our own house in order.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This murder tragically illustrates what homophobia can lead to. It is a tragic example that shows that homophobia, although largely underestimated, is, in fact, very real, and the sad reality of homophobic violence is not unique to Belgium. In most Member States, homosexuals are still victims of discrimination and harassment and even physical attacks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Belgium, the government has expressed its willingness to implement a national action plan against homophobia to systematically combat violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. The Union, which proudly vindicates individual freedoms and respect for the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination, must take Belgium’s lead and fight for a European action plan against homophobia.

My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act.</p>

However, there are some ring-fenced issues that we cannot forget. Firstly, the family must be understood as the union of a man and a woman, completed and given full expression by the birth of children, which cannot happen between two people of the same sex.</p>
      <p sl="it">Two homosexual people can live together freely, perhaps even enjoying forms of legal recognition on a voluntary basis. That said, there can be no talk, for example, of marriage or adoption of children. I do not think we can go against nature, which requires a man and a woman in order to procreate. Everything else is just senseless arrogance, which comes close to the absurd in some extreme cases, such as male mothers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I am very pleased by your opinions. If you do not mind, I do not intend to talk about countries outside of the European Union, because we also have a problem with homophobia in the Member States of the European Union. Not so long ago, maybe a couple of days – last week, a member of parliament in my country spoke before the Chamber and said that homosexuals are sick people who should be locked up somewhere and should receive treatment. So we should not pretend that it exists outside of the European Union, it exists here as well – within the Member States of the European Union. I am always surprised by such statements because when I meet someone, I do not ask them about their sexual orientation. When I choose my friends, both male and female, I do not ask them what they get up to within their sexual orientation. I always try to ensure that my friends and the people I talk to are decent people – people who may have the same perspective on life as I do. I am therefore very sorry that even today, members of the LGBT community are exposed to such attacks, not only from extremists, but also by policy makers in the Member States of the European Union. In my opinion, as each Member State is unable to regulate same-sex cohabitation, it would be appropriate for us to regulate such cohabitation at a European Union level. It is high time for us to do so, as it is quite evident that the Member States of the European Union have been unable to tackle this agenda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think there was quasi-unanimity among the speakers. Homophobia has no place in Europe, either in an open form or in a hidden form, in any Member State, and that includes those Member States which are newcomers to the European family. It has no place against any citizen, wherever he or she may be, in the EU or in those countries outside the EU which want to have relations with us. I made that clear in my speech and I quoted Baroness Ashton, who regularly intervenes on specific issues in such countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because I agree with it, I will not repeat everything that has been said. There was, however, one question which I have already answered several times in written form but which I think it is important to answer in this Chamber in order to make things clear. It concerns the link between the Free Movement Directive and the mutual recognition of same-sex couples. You know that the Free Movement Directive provides for the right of entry and residence for Union citizens and their family members, regardless of the recognition of same-sex marriages or partnerships. Such recognition is immaterial for the purposes of the application of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 24 of the directive ensures that same-sex couples who exercise their right to free movement have the same rights within the scope of the Treaty as same-sex couples in the host Member State. The mere fact of having exercised the right to free movement does not imply that same-sex couples would acquire more rights in the host Member State than those guaranteed to their own nationals in that Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of recognition of marriages does not fall within the scope of the Free Movement Directive. In order to apply it correctly, Member States do not need to address the recognition of same-sex unions. They need simply to grant entry and residence to the couples in question and to their family members, including spouses and partners, irrespective of their sexual orientation. This means that all Member States are obliged to grant the right of residence to a Union citizen’s spouse regardless of sexual orientation, but the host Member State is under no obligation to recognise the marriage under its national law.</p>
      <p sl="en">So much for the legal question, but when this legal question is not handled properly, what do we do? I shall give you a very concrete example. A Polish authority refused to issue certificates on civil status to citizens wishing to marry, or conclude a registered partnership with, a person of the same sex in a Member State where this is possible. The Commission intervened on the basis that such a stance was incompatible with respect for private and family life, and the Polish authorities informed us that steps would be taken to abolish the practice of asking the sex of the future spouse or partner. I give you this example in order to explain what the law says and to explain how, without making a big fuss, we can intervene in the application of the law in a Member State in order to have that Member State change a practice which is not in accordance with our European rules.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, if I had to sum up the impressions that I will be taking back to the Council with me, my first observation would be that I am pleased to find that, whether we are talking about Parliament, the Commission or the Council, we share the clear view that discrimination must be fought, and that the protection of fundamental rights is the basis of European cooperation. As I have made very clear during today’s debate, the Council is absolutely with the European Parliament on this, and naturally the Council upholds the principle that no citizen may be subject to discrimination on account of his or her sexual orientation, for example. That is a fundamental principle. In this connection it is, of course, also key that all Member States take the necessary measures to ensure that the fundamental rights of all EU citizens are respected and enforced, not only according to the letter of the law, but also in practice in real life. The Danish Presidency of the EU will therefore continue to work on the anti-discrimination directive, which could come to make a very important contribution to implementing the ban on discrimination outside the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="da">I have noted the strong and correct views expressed here today, and I am happy to assure you that I will pass them on to the Council.

All of us here in this Chamber – whether we are members of Parliament, of the Commission or of the Council, wherever we come from, whatever we believe in, whatever our sexuality – we all share the common task of ensuring that homophobia, which was an abhorrent part of our history, is never again allowed to become a part of Europe’s future.

We here in Parliament are well aware of the fate of motions for amendment that are voted down and how much weight they carry: none whatsoever.

Last Sunday, I took part in the Kraków March for Equality, which was held under the slogan ‘Diversity, Solidarity, Equality’. Our diversity was cheerful, colourful and friendly, but the counter-demonstration held by the bovver boys from the National Rebirth of Poland movement exuded a pathological hatred.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Homophobia, like every phobia, is an illness and needs to be treated. However, what we are seeing in Poland is not homophobia but a form of chauvinism favouring one sexual orientation over another, and it needs to be fought by adopting appropriate legislation. Apart from good law, active promotion of equal opportunities is needed and a strengthening of society’s awareness of equality issues, for example, by addressing the issue of non-discrimination, beginning at nursery school and in all areas of policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An end to discrimination against homosexuals in the European Union can be achieved only by a directive establishing a uniform, minimum level of protection for people who suffer discrimination because of their age, sexual orientation, disability, religion or world view. A key factor is for there to be complete separation of Church and State, because homophobia and its expression in laws which discriminate against homosexuals find particularly good conditions for development precisely in situations in which too large a role is played by religion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, last January, a bluefin tuna caught off the coast of north-eastern Japan reached a record high in the first auction of the fish market in Tsukiji in Tokyo, reaching EUR 570 000. The price of this 269 kilo tuna beats last year’s previous record of EUR 320 000. This is simply crazy and explains how important this business is.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tomorrow, the European Parliament will vote on EU legislation introducing new internationally agreed rules for the bluefin tuna fishery in European waters. As the 2012 bluefin fishing season opened last week, the rules clearly need to be swiftly implemented. In addition to quotas, these rules set out the conditions, practice and equipment for the fishing and farming of these iconic and endangered fish species. Unfortunately, the rules fall far short of what international scientific advice deems necessary to give this unique, beautiful and highly priced fish species a decent chance of recovering from its current critically low stock levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sorry state of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and Mediterranean is well known. Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks have declined by up to three-quarters over the past 40 years and, given the long reproductive cycle of the fish, the prospects for recovery are not good. Documented and legal over-fishing of bluefin has been really exacerbated by illegal, regulated and unreported fishing of these high-value fish. High profile cases of this kind included last year’s illegal fishing in Libyan waters during the war.</p>
      <p sl="en">The heavy involvement of organised crime in the fishing and farming of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean is also a major cause of concern. Furthermore, given the scale of illegal and unreported fishing, it is impossible to get an accurate picture of how many fish are being caught. However, different estimates suggest the amounts being caught are multiples of the actual allowed quotas, which themselves are already unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that sense, this new legislation, although necessary, represents a missed opportunity for the EU to take meaningful steps to prevent the demise of bluefin tuna. Instead, Europe is continuing to hide behind the fig-leaf offered by ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), or rather its contractual parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of us believe that, ultimately, only a complete ban on commercial fishing would give the species a fighting chance of recovery. Failing that, ICCAT should be agreeing to completely close certain areas for bluefin fishing, particularly during the spawning season, rather than simply adopting half-hearted quotas that are not in line with scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I tried this with the previous amendments to my report, but unfortunately, the majority of my colleagues did not follow this. That was bad luck. Still, I believe that the EU, as the main fisher of this stock, must accept a large chunk of responsibility for driving bluefin tuna to the brink. Tougher controls of the fleet and the related industry are also necessary to prevent illegal fishing and over-fishing. The EU must mobilise more resources to this end and assist other ICCAT members that lack the resources for proper enforcement. This is particularly true in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU legislation set to be adopted tomorrow represents the bare minimum and is simply a minimalist implementation of the international ICCAT recovery plan. While there are some slight improvements, with the reduction of the amount of bluefin tuna that can be caught and tightening of controls, it still falls far below what scientists believe is necessary to give the bluefin stock a fighting chance of recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I insist once again that there is nothing stopping the EU from adopting more ambitious measures. That is what I expected to have in the report and that is the least we can do in the future, especially when we meet with the other ICCAT contractual parties in November.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Ms Damanaki, I would like to thank Mr Romeva for the work he has done on this report, and I am also very pleased to see the strong support from the Fisheries Committee on the substance of this important proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur is absolutely right: the recovery of bluefin tuna is a very important issue because this is the most important species covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and currently the only one subject to a multiannual recovery plan. The EU has been a leading force behind this multiannual recovery plan, and the aim of the Commission’s proposal is to transpose into EU law a recommendation adopted in the ICCAT framework. The recommendation sets out a number of management measures to support the recovery of bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="en">These measures were adopted by ICCAT as early as November 2010, and have been in force since June 2011. A week ago, and for the second time, we entered a fishing season without such management measures being transposed into EU law. This could jeopardise the uniform application of the measures within the EU and make them more difficult to enforce vis-à-vis individuals. It is therefore vital that we transpose ICCAT measures into EU law without delay. Not doing so would certainly set us back from a conservation standpoint, and it would also seriously undermine the credibility of the EU in ICCAT and internationally.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore warmly welcome both colegislators’ efforts to conclude this matter rapidly. The Commission can accept the compromise text agreed in the last trialogue but it will make a declaration that this is without prejudice to its future position as regards recourse to implementing acts for the effective transposition of international conservation and management measures adopted by regional fisheries management organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like, once again, to thank the rapporteur and the Fisheries Committee for their work, and I am looking forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we have the opportunity today to discuss one of the specific risks targeting food security: major threats to the global fish stocks. Fish plays a key role in a healthy diet, being one of the most recommended sources of animal protein. This vital resource is being decimated by unsustainable exploitation based on not only fishing practices which ignore long-term food security, but also on abuses deriving from illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to thank the rapporteur for his efforts to tighten the regulations on the bluefin tuna fishery. At the same time, I am disappointed to say that his amendments and our similar amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have not received sufficient support. The measures provided for by the new international agreement will ensure that existing regulations are implemented and enforced more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is a hugely important step. I must thank those who have made it possible for these improvements to come into force before the start of the new season. However, the reality clearly shows us that these measures will not be adequate. Future agreements will have to be much more ambitious if we really intend to protect the marine environment and the source of healthy food it provides us with.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, unlike my colleagues, I believe that Parliament has managed to achieve a text for first reading that is very balanced between the measures needed for protection and recovery of the bluefin tuna agreed with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), maintaining fleet activity and the strengthening of control measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">To do so, the Committee on Fisheries has removed some of the rapporteur’s extreme proposals, which would have led to the halting of the activity of the fleet of European vessels, and only European vessels, with the disastrous socio-economic consequences that would have been incurred.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is worth remembering that since 2006, there have been successive recovery plans for bluefin tuna, and as well as the fact that to change the game rules half way through and for only the European fleet would be unfair and discriminatory, it is doubtful the sustainability of the resource would benefit, given that the rest of the fleets could continue to operate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I would like to insist on the need to shorten the period for the transposition of the recommendations adopted in the headquarters of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) into EU law. In this case, the delay has been due to the incomprehensible opposition of the European Commission and some of Parliament’s groups to including provisions for implementing acts in the article of the regulation, which had reasonably been requested by the Council, with the aim of achieving legal security when it comes to the interpretation of particular technical aspects that could impede compliance with the control obligations set by ICCAT.</p>

      <p sl="de">There is a plan here to try to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2022 and a restoration of biomass. This is a credible target. If we can indeed achieve that for fish stocks across the whole of the European Union, across the world, then we will be well pleased.</p>
      <p sl="de">The control measures that ICCAT is introducing, the rules and regulations, are, on paper, as good as you will see anywhere. They are, in fact, tighter than those in place anywhere else. But this, of course, is not an ordinary fish. This is a fish, as the rapporteur has said, which can command prices of up to EUR 500 000 for a single fish. That means that every method that we try to put in place to control fishing activity will be circumvented if it can be circumvented. Organised crime may be involved, as the money that is involved in this industry is just huge. That is why quotas are being exceeded, why there have been illegal catches and cases of massive under-reporting and falsification of documents over the years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Even now, the Pew Environment Trust is saying that, looking at the most recent figures from across the world, it is quite clear from the amount of world trade taking place that the quotas for the Mediterranean and the Atlantic bluefin tuna – quotas that in theory represent the maximum that can be caught – are being greatly exceeded.</p>
      <p sl="de">Well, I suppose that this is a test: can we in practice ensure that bluefin tuna are protected and survive and that we are able to recover the species, or will we see it eliminated for the sake of greed? Well, what can we say? We are putting in the measures, we are calling for the maximum criminal penalties to be put in place to enforce those measures.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, with regard to the sale of a bluefin tuna at the beginning of this year in the fish market in Tokyo, referred to by both Chris Davies and Mr Romeva i Rueda, the fish in question weighed 270 kilos and was sold for EUR 575 000, that is EUR 2 000 a kilo. That shows that what Chris Davies was saying is absolutely right. However, I have to correct him, as the average price for bluefin tuna is about USD 10 000, or the equivalent in euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bluefin tuna are prized for their red, meaty flesh by sushi eaters, and the eastern Atlantic stock of bluefin tuna has been plundered to the point where it was almost listed as an endangered species in 2009. This, of course, met with fierce opposition from Japan, which consumes 80% of the world’s catch of bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such is the value of this iconic fish that it is estimated that around a third of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock of bluefin tuna is being sold on the black market. This is, therefore, a hugely lucrative industry that often involves gangsters and other criminals. That is why the Romeva i Rueda report is so important. The bluefin tuna stocks have been slowly recovering due to the diligence of the European Fisheries Agency in Vigo, but more needs to be done. That is why we are calling for a further reduction in the annual Total Allowable Catch, with a tightening up of controls and further measures to reduce fleet capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, EU countries are not the only ones fishing in the Mediterranean basin, and that is why we need to see the provisions of the ICCAT fully implemented, with an end to rule-bending and an end to the impunity for illegal fishing that has led to decades of over-exploitation.</p>

According to the European Commission, fisheries are at crisis point, due to overfishing of fish stocks by 75% and, in the Mediterranean basin, by 82%. The issue of illegal fisheries (IUU) should be tabled as a priority. Particular attention should be paid to taking appropriate measures to combat illegal fisheries and guarantee effective control, especially of third countries not in the European Union. Without doubt, the European Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo has achieved positive results. However, they are not enough.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I welcome the transposition into EU law of the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) which have, most recently, amended the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna, thereby reinforcing the measures aimed at this stock’s recovery.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Recently, a level of bluefin tuna recovery has been recorded, but we need to go further, not just because the recovery level is not satisfactory, but also because the financial pressure on this fishery are very great, which encourages overfishing and even illegal practices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Sound management of bluefin tuna, which can only be ensured by suitable multiannual recovery plans, is crucial from an environmental perspective, as well as socially and economically, as it will guarantee the future continuation of this valuable resource, which is the driving force behind an important fisheries sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That being the case, it is important to acknowledge that the ICCAT proposals currently being transposed into European legislation owing to statutory rules can be improved and have been improved by the EU itself, whose legislation in this regard is more ambitious than that of the ICCAT. However, I would stress that it is crucial to be aware, not just of the importance of preserving and protecting the bluefin tuna, but also of the need to guarantee an equitable situation for all operators in this sector and not simplistically adopt unilateral measures stepping up restrictions. It certainly is important that the European Union exercises genuine influence over the ICCAT on the promotion and implementation of sustainable and comprehensive conservation levels for all operators.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, we are debating a useful management tool that should be implemented as effectively as possible. I would like to address some critical aspects of the compromise.</p>
      <p sl="it">First, creating sanctuaries and identifying spawning grounds. Researchers and scientific data confirm that creating sanctuaries in EU areas would damage only the European fishing industry while encouraging that of other countries; as we have heard, we are eight against at least 22. Sanctuaries are pointless for fish species that are highly migratory. Proper, rational and sustainable fishing management is surely much, much more sensible.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, it has long been known that the tuna’s main spawning grounds are in the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico, both of which contain very few areas where it does not reproduce on account of oceanographic conditions unfavourable to the tuna’s reproductive biology. As recent research has shown, even the length of the reproductive period can vary significantly.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards fixed tuna traps, I favour reviving a proposal put forward at the symposium of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas in Tangier in February 2011; this is an activity that has been practised for nearly 2 600 years. Therefore, why not grant the existing traditional fixed tuna traps UNESCO world heritage status?</p>

Competitiveness issues have meant a plan that should be completed in 2013 has been on hold for two years.</p>
      <p sl="es">We think it is very important that the measures are implemented immediately so that the sustainability and diversity that enrich our marine world are effectively guaranteed and, in that sense, that tuna as a species is effectively regulated, and that there need to be controls that allow the levels of Total Allowable Catch to be respected under the conditions proposed.</p>

A further reduction in the Total Allowable Catch is likely to be necessary but, in my opinion, the need to correctly identify and then provide support and protection for spawning grounds and existing control measures is a prerequisite for a successful recovery plan. In this respect, closer monitoring of international trade, along with proper documentation of all catches, will clearly help to reduce the influx of catches made in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>

The question then arises as to how to prepare and how to react in a situation when bluefin tuna fishing is, in many ways, exceptional. It is obvious that we should provide protection for spawning grounds, impose a minimum size of tuna which can be caught and set up caging operations, not to mention the creation of reserves, but this is not enough. We need to think more globally by ensuring consistency with other legal obligations. We know what needs to be done, but often there is a lack of political will. The profits from these catches are so high that they encourage people to engage in harmful and, of course, illegal fishing. Measures have been provided for international management and supervision and we are moving in the right direction. Let us hope that this time, we will be successful.</p>

      <p sl="en">The history of management of the bluefin tuna fishery is long, complicated and, thus far at least, not crowned with success. Though the stock has been fished for millennia, the problems began in earnest in the 1990s, when the practice of caging bluefin was introduced in order to fatten them up for the Japanese market. Japanese market demand was met through an uncontrolled – and, in the case of the EU, heavily subsidised – expansion in the size of the purse seine fleet targeting the Mediterranean stock.</p>
      <p sl="en">The complexity of the fishery and the need for constant vigilance on the part of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) are demonstrated by the volume of regulation. During the past 20 years, 64 management measures have been adopted, of which 13 are still in effect. Two are of particular importance. The recovery plan was first adopted in 2006, when it was 14 pages long, including annexes. It was amended in 2008, 2009 and again in 2010, by which time it had swollen to 30 pages. There is also a catch documentation scheme, adopted in 2007 and amended in 2008 and 2009. I hope the ICCAT bluefin recovery plan can succeed where, so far, we have failed.</p>

I wholeheartedly welcome the position of the rapporteur who feels that the EU should not wait for the ICCAT initiatives but should adopt alone robust precautionary measures in keeping with the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. I welcome the idea of declaring the main spawning zones of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, which lie within EU jurisdiction, closed areas or sanctuaries, thereby banning fishermen from having access to these zones during the spawning season. I am aware that the EU not only sets out some very tight regulations in this area, but also spends considerable sums specifically to comply with these regulations.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of my report, ‘EU and China: unbalanced Trade?’, accurately conveys the issue we are now facing, with China destined to become the leading world power before the turn of the next century.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Relations between China and Europe are unbalanced. I would remind you that our trade deficit with China has more than tripled in 10 years. This is the challenge that faces us then, because with the European economy now apparently slowing down and setbacks in growth, there is reason to fear that it is no longer able to compete globally with its erstwhile confidence and drive. The framework that shapes our future has been turned on its head. It is up to us to redefine it, not by turning inward, which would only result in ruin, but by building a new partnership with China, the guidelines of which will ultimately be simple to define: reciprocal rules, balanced trade and transparent trade relations. I say this with all the more conviction because, in an open global economy, China needs Europe as much as Europe needs China. I say this with all the more certainty because I believe that now, during these times of crisis, is the time to forge deeper relations based on a more balanced partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks in particular to the work of the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for the opinions whom I commend, this report by the Committee on International Trade sets the framework and defines its requirements. These include encouraging China to open up its markets to European companies and accede to the multilateral Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). It also includes tempering the Chinese system of joint ventures and strategic technology transfers, promoting EU-China customs cooperation to combat counterfeiting. It includes encouraging the European Union to make use wherever necessary of trade defence instruments and more effectively defending the interests of European industry by reviewing the directive on intellectual property rights. It includes demanding strict compliance with European rules and standards for all Chinese goods in circulation on the internal market. It includes urging the Commission to negotiate a fair yet ambitious EU-China investment agreement, which guarantees transparency. It includes levelling out monetary competition with a coordinated system that identifies the holders of sovereign debt and encourages China to let the yuan set its own value. It also includes taking action to ultimately reform the World Trade Organisation to encompass compliance with social, health and environmental standards</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I want to stress one last important point. All this would be in vain, however, should the EU refuse to implement a concerted policy of production and reindustrialisation, as well as a policy of research and innovation that met the new global challenges. I would also like to add one more requirement, one that is absolutely vital, and that is better coordination between Member States so that bilateral relations between China and any one of them do not weaken the Union’s position. On this issue of relations with China, as in many others, but especially this one, Europe needs to speak with one voice, and to have and defend a single policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, by adopting this report, we are giving the Commission and the Council a coherent road map that can restore the balance in our relations with China and respond effectively to the deep concerns of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this was indeed a very important presentation that Ms de Sarnez has given us and I know also that four Parliament committees have contributed to this important work – important because China is a very topical issue and essential for our foreign trade interests. Parliament’s views on these links are obviously a crucial part of our platform in the dialogue with China.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can agree with many of the specific findings in the report. China is increasingly driving global growth at a difficult time for the international economy, and it is our fastest growing export market. But, at the same time, the list of issues we need to address with China grows longer, and the report is right in suggesting that there is a general feeling in Europe that economic openness in China is not improving enough. This highlights some of our concerns with China. Let me go through some of these.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential for EU interests to have improved intellectual property rights’ enforcement in China. European companies excel in cutting-edge technologies and this is part of our competitive advantage. It is a fact that IPR infringements undermine not only European investment and engagement in China but just as much China’s ambition to develop its economy. We should therefore redouble our efforts on IPR and we will use this report as a useful guide in addressing this with China.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree with the report that we should aim for an ambitious and balanced investment agreement with China. Important sectors in China remain restricted for foreign investment and I believe that Europe’s open investment regime remains our strongest argument for others to grant us similar access. At the EU-China summit in February, we agreed to move towards bilateral investment negotiations. Market access in China will be part of this, as will the way our investments are treated in China.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also states that we need to strengthen transparency regarding foreign direct investment in Europe. I agree with this in principle, but also we need to be careful not to create new investment barriers at a time when Europe needs to remain attractive to maintain growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report’s view on access to the public procurement market in China underlines why the Commission is pushing for China to accede to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Limited and unbalanced access to many procurement markets globally is also why the Commission has proposed an external procurement instrument which aims at ensuring better reciprocity in the way our companies can get access to foreign markets, compared with the open access they enjoy in the EU. With such an instrument, we can have a better platform for addressing procurement concerns with China.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the report rightly notes, it is crucial for European businesses that we vigilantly defend our interests whenever trade rules are not respected. We are doing this with anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruments and we have resorted to the WTO when that was necessary, for example, to address restrictions on access to raw materials and rare earths. On the question of whether China can obtain market economy status, I can only insist that this depends mainly on China itself, as it has to meet a number of objective criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think it is important that the report also points to a path forward. Even if our long-term vision for a strategic partnership with China can come under pressure from day-to-day issues, it is important that we keep in mind the vast potential for European businesses in China, and this raises the question of how we in Europe engage in China and with China. It is essential that the Commission, Parliament, the Member States, and the EU actors pass a coherent message to our respective Chinese counterparts. Only in this way will the EU be able to deal effectively with the different aspects of our trade relations with China and only in this way will we progress towards a stronger, deeper, and more balanced relationship with maximum mutual benefits for both sides.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I have perhaps just two remarks. First, China is often criticised in the European Parliament for its human rights situation, for what we call social and environmental dumping, and for breaches of the law, particularly in the area of intellectual property, and we criticise China where this is deserved, of course. In criticising China, however, we must ensure that we do not avoid correcting our own faults, as – and this has been heard more today than in previous debates – we can only have an equal relationship with China if we are a competitive European Union in which economic growth is also secured. That is the first issue, and we must also make an effort in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The second issue is that China has long since ceased to be a developing country. It is a different country from the one of 10 years ago. It is an economic and political superpower with a highly attractive and competitive market, and we can also see major changes in the country’s social structure. Ultimately, China is, in its own way, an entire continent and not just another country, so we must treat it as an equal partner. In my opinion, we have much to gain from this equal partnership.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Europe and China are, of course, very important trading partners. China has an ever increasing impact on today’s global economy and thus also has an enormous responsibility when it comes to adhering to social standards.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The respect of human and social rights as part of the cooperation between Europe and China is also essential. In this regard, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the efforts made by the Chinese central and local authorities. However, we would point out that sustainably funding a stable social security and health system that benefits all the country’s provinces to the same extent is one of the biggest challenges facing the Chinese Government in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Strict and effective monitoring of compliance with the legislation governing working conditions is also necessary, even in times of economic crisis. It is not our job to be constantly lecturing China, but we can help it establish new systems by exchanging experience and working methods. We would also point out the responsibility of Western companies that operate in China.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we also ask the Commission to implement an integrated European policy in the south-east Asian region and to get the investment strategy with China started as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, it goes without saying that failing to comply with social and environmental standards and human rights also creates an imbalance between the EU and China. However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to point out a couple of problems with the report on EU-China trade relations. Overall, it is a good report that draws attention to some significant problems: technical barriers to trade, non-technical barriers to trade, problems involving rare earth elements, and so on – circumstances that I myself pointed out in my capacity as rapporteur for this area in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
      <p sl="da">The fact that I nonetheless have some concerns regarding the report is due to its heavy emphasis on reciprocity. As a liberal and an advocate of free trade, I think this is the wrong road to go down. Reciprocity is an incredibly emotionally charged word that means something very different to different people, so to require reciprocity would be akin to throwing a grenade into the negotiations with China. It can only be interpreted as meaning that the EU wants to close its markets to the same extent as China, which would be tantamount to a trade war.</p>
      <p sl="da">Let me state that I have nothing against imposing requirements on our trade partners and using the strength of the EU, but I feel that we have to be cautious about using the word reciprocity. For that reason, I would have preferred wording along the lines of creating equal and fair competitive conditions, or a level playing field as we call it – which is the term that I myself used in my opinion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start with congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur. Her job was not easy because a wide range of views were incorporated into amendments and compromise amendments, but ultimately – and I speak on behalf of the PPE – we find most of our ideas in this report. The word ‘reciprocity’ was the key word used by everybody, and there is only one possible sense of that word: it refers to the fact that the European Union is open, and that China should be open and should reciprocate the openness of the European Union. That much is clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several controversial issues for us are addressed in the report, notably, the questions of the public procurement market, joint ventures and the possibility for foreign companies to have a presence on the Chinese market. Of course, the matter of intellectual property rights is one of the hot potatoes of the moment, but that is an evergreen in EU-China relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the crystal clear statement made here a few minutes ago by Commissioner Reding, who stated that EU recognition of market economy status depends on China itself. I think that is, or should be, the position of this House too, and the Commission should ensure that it is translated into reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">The institutional framework for EU-China relations requires attention. We have a multiplicity of redundant institutional frameworks, so let us take care of that. Let us speak with one European Union voice in our relations with China, and also with the other BRICs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I think that the principle of reciprocity will bring balance to our relations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of trade relations between China and the European Union, we evoke relationships which, on many occasions, have affected the course of history, as the pendulum has swung between East and West.</p>
      <p sl="it">The pendulum appears now to be firmly in the East. Europe seems to be labouring in China’s wake, as our second trading partner has seen its exports rise by 39.5% in just under two years. It is our loss if we view China only as a source of problems, as certain nationalist and protectionist elements on the political right have been trying to portray it for years, and not also as an opportunity. In the 21st century, however, the greatest world economies can work together only in an atmosphere of reciprocity, compliance with the rules, and intolerance of illegality, of unfair practices and of discrimination, to which we have grown accustomed after a great many absolutely unacceptable episodes.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is understandable that the pendulum of history is now swinging in favour of emerging countries. It is right that we open our markets. However, the Chinese Government has a number of unacceptable policies: protecting its country’s businesses while leaving our companies’ intellectual property inadequately safeguarded; the proliferation of technical barriers, sometimes much more burdensome than tariff barriers; keeping a closed procurement market; and an almost total disregard for the most basic social and human rights, as the oppression in Tibet shows.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the European Union, terms like ‘reciprocity’ and ‘traceability’ – which recall others, now long forgotten, like ‘transparency’ and ‘quality’ – must become a precondition for every trade agreement and every legislative initiative within the framework of a renewed multilateral policy. It is our duty, therefore, to keep our market open while protecting the Union’s interest from outside protectionism – from China and elsewhere – by demanding adequate quality standards for the goods and services available in the European Union market. This report addresses these matters with clarity, describes important solutions, and is heading in the right direction. It will therefore have our support.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report by the vice-chair of the Liberal and Democratic group, a group that believes, perhaps more than others, in trade as a means of spreading well-being and stability worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.</p>

      <p sl="it">Besides, the battles fought by the Commission, among others, within the WTO through various disputes – such as that on raw materials – have been very effective and satisfying. Furthermore, the WTO can certainly also be relied upon as regards various anti-dumping procedures. That does not mean, however, that we can lower our guard when it comes to granting China market economy status, on the one hand, or, on the other, that we should not exploit our own provisions, such as reciprocity, to demonstrate a firmer stance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. I fully support the initiative undertaken by the Commission to secure better investment rules and relations between the EU and China.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, my support depends on the following conditions: the securing of appropriate market access for EU investment in China – and we have heard about that from Mr Rinaldi – and the establishment of appropriate rules to attract support and Chinese investment into the European Union. I think it is important to note that, while caution felt towards China can be justified, we must stop seeing China purely as a threat to our growth and recognise the opportunities that a strong China-EU relationship can bring.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is particularly true when it comes to fostering new partnerships in the development of new-generation energy, technology, etc. I know, Commissioner, we have had our disagreements about Huawei, but it is a company which has invested tremendously in Europe, and I see that as a huge opportunity for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Discrimination in trade practices should not be tolerated, and should not give rise to a tit-for-tat mentality that simply leads to greater imbalances. A shift away from openness will hinder the development of any mutually beneficial relationships and, as you know, Commissioner, as a believer in the free market, I believe openness should underpin all trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that more open, transparent trade relations will develop, and that these will lead to a greater respect for the rule of law, especially in the field of international trade. Commissioner, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaty. It is in your power to propose regulations to stop or control dumping, to control standards and quality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Winkler mentioned something very important, a great problem for us: the situation of counterfeiting. We have a piece of legislation coming up, ACTA, which will help, and you have my full support in your position on that. I know it is difficult but let us hope that we can stop counterfeiting.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we cannot ignore China, and with all his working experience, this is something Commissioner De Gucht knows all about. That said, that is not something that we should want in any case. China is our second largest trading partner, the second largest economy in the world and it has been seeing astonishingly strong growth for years. That provides unrivalled opportunities for European companies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do have concerns, though, which I also see reflected in the solid report produced by Ms de Sarnez. European companies have to face a great many obstacles on the Chinese market, and China’s ambitions when it comes to lifting these barriers do not appear to be very high. I am thus issuing an urgent call to both partners to set to work on this. Reciprocity – and this has been mentioned quite often this evening already – needs to be the key word in the mutual relationship.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time, the Commission needs to continue pressing China to live up to its WTO obligations: allowing European companies a level playing field, protecting intellectual property rights and eliminating other trade barriers, such as restricted access to raw materials.</p>

In this respect, this debate is taking place at the right time and the Chinese will be paying considerable attention to the expectations and opinions of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the interparliamentary delegation for relations with China has asked me to look in more detail at the transition to renewable energy in the People’s Republic. It is clear that the Chinese have defined renewable energies, and by no means just photovoltaics, as a strategic growth industry and are taking extensive measures to ensure that they have a technological advantage, to establish the industry in their own country and to become heavily involved in the industry by means of ownership and dumping issues. We are aware of the problem that, especially in the field of renewable energies, so-called European partners have only been allowed to own 20% of joint ventures. That figure has now been slightly increased, but nevertheless we are seeing competitive dumping on a massive scale, specifically in the wind energy industry. The photovoltaics sector has already been discussed. A total of 40 state-owned Chinese companies are being given what by international standards amounts to very one-sided preferential treatment, and we are aware of the complaints that have been made by the US, because China wants to establish pioneering businesses at a national level and is disregarding many of the principles of international trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">The tragic aspect of this situation is that the European Union is once again taking action too late in a growth market, a market of the future. Ultimately, this will come back to haunt us via the votes of our citizens, who do not understand what is happening. This is why I am making an urgent call for the European Union to focus on the industries of the future in its trade relations and to take much tougher measures in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Ms de Sarnez has said, the world has undergone dramatic changes. I am constantly shocked to discover that in one of the large Member States of the European Union, for example in Germany, which has a population of 80 million, many citizens are still not aware of how important it is for the European Union to speak with one voice on foreign policy and foreign trade policy. The 1.3 billion people in China are totally uninterested in what even 80 million German people think about a specific subject. Therefore, I am very, very grateful that foreign trade policy is an area which the European Union is responsible for.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to give Ms de Sarnez my strong support for her statements on a number of critical points. The degree of access which our businesses have to the Chinese market is totally unacceptable in some areas and has nothing at all to do with how open our European market is to Chinese businesses. However, we expect the Chinese to also open up their markets. This applies in general to all products, but also to public procurement. When it comes to investment, I am particularly concerned that we are still in a situation where investment in certain areas is totally regulated by the state, that obstacles are being placed in the path of European companies and that mandatory technology transfers have been taking place for some years. Mr De Gucht, in all the discussions that the European Union and you yourself have had in recent years with the Chinese, you have hardly made any progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I would be very grateful if we could at last begin to move forwards in the forthcoming dialogue on an investment protection agreement. We need fair rules and equality. In recent weeks, I have fortunately encountered on several occasions Chinese investors who are investing in Europe. They can do this because our market is open and because it is also open to Chinese investment. I would be very pleased if, in the next few weeks, we could make progress on the issue of how European companies can do business on the Chinese market, how they can invest there and how they can purchase goods and materials there without having to hand over their technology.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the China-Europe relationship is beneficial for both sides as we know, and will, in my opinion, be an important factor in the definition of the new world order that will come out of the crisis we are suffering.</p>
      <p sl="es">China’s importance as a strategic partner for the European Union is well known, but as with all relationships, it has its issues. One of those is trade imbalance and this report deals with it well.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time as Chinese investments benefit from easy penetration thanks to our opening up of the European market and our clear regulations, European companies often encounter difficulties in accessing the Chinese market, particularly, as we are all also aware, in public procurement, banking and telecommunications, among other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, the report stresses the need to rebalance the relationship between the European Union and China. For that to occur, there is an acknowledged need for the Commission and the Member States to improve their coordination to strengthen our position with China in the most sensitive areas. Whilst there are Member States that relate freely with China, the work of the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht will be more difficult and our position will be weakened. We can only reset the balance of our relationships with China if we act together.</p>
      <p sl="es">I repeat that China is a strategic partner for the European Union and can play a leading role in exiting the crisis suffered in Europe in recent years. However, it is also a fierce competitor and the object of disputes: the violation of World Trade Organisation rules, dumping, intellectual property rights, etc. For that reason, the report questions China automatically being awarded market economy status in 2016.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need clarity on this issue to be able to do business with our Chinese business partners under the best conditions. I was going to ask the Commission for their opinion of China automatically being awarded market economy status, but as I have already heard – I am finishing, Mr President – Commissioner Reding already give her thoughts on it, I have nothing further to ask.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, today, Parliament has finally recognised the serious problems that China causes to the internal market: unfair competition, counterfeiting and relocation, to name a few.</p>
      <p sl="it">China undoubtedly bears primary responsibility for the decline of European industrial policy. Suffocated by the invasion of cheap Asian products, our companies are cut out of the market. The result is that those that can, relocate, probably to China itself; those who cannot, close down.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must stop talking and start acting. We must combat this phenomenon, for the price of failure is too high in economic and, above all, social terms. China is growing, with a GDP of 8%, exploiting its workers and producing in an unregulated fashion; meanwhile, in Europe, as many as 23 million people are now out of work, and tens of thousands more can expect to lose their jobs. Where I come from, the Veneto region, in the first few months of 2012, companies like Safilo, Redi and Ditec decided to relocate, leaving thousands of employees without work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, it is very much in the interest of many Member States, driven by the dark forces of finance, to pretend not to understand the consequences of this unbalanced kind of trade for the European economy. Those of us who represent European citizens must put people first and safeguard jobs, through protected designations of origin, by fighting counterfeiting and relocation, and by imposing duty. That is the only way to give Europe’s market back to its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as is the case every year, Parliament debates trade relations with China and, as is the case every year, we are overwhelmed with what we find. China does not respect its international commitments, any more this year than it did last year. It exercises large-scale dumping in all areas, it makes a mockery of intellectual property as it does the concept of first dollar, it seizes raw materials from developing countries, it heavily subsidises its businesses and exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Being weak in the face of such behaviour has resulted in the deindustrialisation of Europe, companies relocating, millions of jobs being lost and our markets being flooded with poor quality goods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">China should not have entered the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the European Commission seemed to be more concerned with implementing free-trade dogmas rather than ensuring the full employment of Europeans. We will never compete with a country where most workers earn less than EUR 70 per month. We will never win if years of effort to increase the competitiveness of our businesses are ruined in a matter of hours by the speculative rise of the Reichsmark, sorry, I mean the euro! I feel sorry for Ms de Sarnez, because everything that she is proposing – usually emergency and common sense measures – will only ever be a stopgap. For as long as we stay in a globalised, finance-driven, ultra-liberal system, we will only be able to reindustrialise our countries sheltered by the sensible and intelligent protection of our economies, by promoting and implementing a strong national and European preference that demands, for all our imports, the same respect for social and environmental standards that we impose on our own producers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I agree with Mr Gollnisch, who said we need to find a way of trading and conducting bilateral commerce with China which would solve all the problems over unequal market access and mutual relations, which the report has documented so well.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I do not think protectionism is a solution. Greater competitiveness in Europe – this is how to compete with the Chinese economy, and it does not have to mean competing on the basis of paying the lowest possible wages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">China is the European Union’s second most important economic partner, and we are the most important partner for China. China is a key source of our imports, and the fact that China and the EU are the two largest economies in the world testifies to the importance of the problem of which we are speaking here. Finally, I would like to make one more point: when we are considering questions of economic relations with China, which, without doubt, are of crucial importance for the future of the economy – ours and China’s – let us never forget that our trading relations must also include an element of protection for human rights, and the situation on this is a continual problem if we are talking about Chinese society and the Chinese State. When doing business, let us not forget that we should expect equal standards, and not just equal social and environmental standards, but also equal standards concerning respect for fundamental human rights, including in the great country of China.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I actually think that this report has come at the right time, firstly because Commissioner De Gucht will be meeting with the Chinese next week, but also because we, at the European Parliament, have been involved in the cross-party organisation of a High Level Forum with the Chinese and this report can therefore be offered for discussion there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also consider it to be a good report. That does not mean to say that I would sign up to everything in it, but I do think it is a good report which has focused on what is important: and as everyone has said, the issue of reciprocity is extremely important, with fair competition and clear rules; there is also everything that has been said about intellectual property rights, counterfeiting and piracy – issues I would gladly sign up to –, including urging the Chinese to introduce international rules in their legislation and ensuring that they are implemented; one final significant matter is getting European companies that have managed to penetrate the Chinese market to lead by example in terms of social and environmental standards – all of which is important – and, then, asking the Commission to improve bilateral coordination of its policies with China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I like in this report, and I say this because we are going to meet the Chinese, is that it is a report based on respect. It is a report that is honest, that is direct, that is respectful, and I think it is written in a language that our Chinese friends can understand, and even demand. I would all the same remind you that this is a great country, in every sense of the word, with nearly a billion and a half people, which has managed to get a third of its population out of poverty in a very short time and which, now, must do its utmost – and I, like my fellow Members, stress this, but with the greatest of respect – to tackle both the issue of social standards and human rights. China knows this. It has included some of these matters in its five-year plan, and we will be ready to discuss all these issues without any taboo.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU continues to provide China with development aid despite its economic expansion. I hope the Chinese are grateful. Well, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I suppose they are: 85% of all pirated goods seized in the EU in 2010 came from China. The West has inflicted much of the harm itself, as nearly all of China’s export trade has been supplied by companies established with Western technology and expertise to compete with our industries and throw our workers on the scrap heap. In the words of the Committee on Industry, there is a ‘temptation for European enterprises to relocate their operations to China in order to cut their costs and increase their profits, to the detriment of the EU workforce’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The countries of Europe must act to protect their manufacturing and the jobs of their peoples. The problem is that EU countries, individually and collectively, have embraced the economic ideology of globalism, while China is, quite understandably, pursuing a policy of economic nationalism.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this is an unusually balanced report on the trade balance with China. It is not the normal swansong which I think we are used to hearing when the EU talks about trade with China.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My father always used to say that anyone who stands in the way of progress will simply get run over. World trade and the world economy are very different now from when I was growing up. They will look even more different in 10, 15 or 20 years’ time. That is a fact and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The fact that China now has such a strong presence in the international trade arena is ultimately a good thing, not just because of the human aspects and the eradication of poverty. It has also been of benefit to us, with increased exports, increased imports of cheap products and low inflation. Fundamentally, this depends on comparative advantages from China and the differences which promote trade. However, this does not mean that China always plays by the rules. On the contrary, China breaches many rules and, in these cases, we need to take particularly tough action. The Chinese have a lack of respect for intellectual property rights and we need to protest about this. Their policy on investment opportunities in China is poor, not to mention online protectionism in the form of the Great Firewall. We must combat all of these problems, but we must continue to accept Chinese exports. Despite everything, the EU is the world’s largest exporter to China and we benefit from trade with China. The most important thing for us to do to bring about a trade balance with China is to make use of our own competitiveness. If we want to change the trade balance, we should do our homework in Brussels and the other EU capitals, rather than visiting Beijing and the rest of China.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for an excellent report, which addresses all the most important problems related to trade and economic relations with China, such as the difficulties with investing in the Chinese market, the problems with accessing Chinese public procurement, the question of the protection of intellectual property and the question of the value of the yuan, to name but a few.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, economic matters are not the only problem in EU-China relations. There is a huge imbalance in our relations – on the one hand, we have European firms operating in accordance with the principle of maximising profit, transferring their production to China or exporting to China or importing from China, and, on the other, we are dealing with a perfectly organised operation, directed in large measure for political purposes by a very strong Chinese State which has recently become much stronger and is operating on a worldwide scale. The Chinese are working extremely well, trading and investing in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Europe. The problem is that we have to answer a question which is not just about economics today, but also about politics: what are the consequences of this? It is clear to see – previous speakers have already made this point – that the Chinese do not always conform to the rules of international trade or to those standards which we would like to be universal. There is a great need for the European Union to concentrate its efforts and present a single position to China (and it does have the instruments to do this) so that the standards which are most important to us are respected by the Chinese, not just in relations with the European Union, but also in the context of investments in other parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I want to commend the rapporteur; she has done an excellent job. The report is very timely given the economic crisis in which we find ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we have to welcome the fact that China has lifted many of the barriers to trade and is more open to dialogue with the Western world. However, as the rapporteur said, there are definite problems. First of all, there is the huge imbalance between the manner in which the EU treats Chinese companies investing in Europe and the manner in which China treats EU companies investing in China. Not only is the situation bad, it is actually getting worse: 43% of the EU companies in Europe confirm that there is anti-EU discrimination; that should be set against a figure of 33% in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem areas have been outlined: first of all, public procurement. Secondly, EU investors are debarred, for example, from owning their own company. You must hand over at least half the ownership of your company if you establish in China. Thirdly, China accounts for 97% of the world production in commodities, and we know the problem in relation to rare earth exports. The WTO settlement body, for example, ruled against the Chinese practice in July 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sheer size, power and potential of China are absolutely phenomenal. Mr Sturdy put it very bluntly. He said we must focus on the positives. I have heard a lot of tough talk here. Let us be honest about it. We are not in a position to talk tough. We cannot bully the Chinese. At the end of the day, the name of the game has to be putting the hand out, freedom and rapprochement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for an interesting report. Firstly, I would like to say that China is the world’s largest exporter of goods, the European Union’s second biggest trading partner and one of the most powerful economies in the world. It is also a country with a huge population. This all goes to show that in view of the problems brought on by the crisis, the EU must, if I may put it this way, reassess EU-China relations. Secondly, the Chinese make use of a number of measures, such as subsidies, price, monetary and social dumping, undervaluation of the yuan and tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. This therefore requires a reaction: attention should also be given to this very important matter, so that bilateral EU-China trade can be conducted under equal conditions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, the Union must be more active in its efforts to make the Chinese market more open to European businesses, in order to change the unfavourable imbalance and make the Chinese market a more friendly environment, particularly to European investment. Fourthly, there is an urgent need to eliminate all situations which involve violations of human rights in Chinese firms. Fifthly, it is also necessary to raise the question of corporate social responsibility as it applies to European businesses and their relations with China so that they put this idea into practice, because European firms which use facilities in the People’s Republic of China should apply EU standards of work and respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the report being debated refers in paragraph 7 to the agricultural sector, which I would describe as superficial, to say the least. The report retains China’s criticism of the agricultural subsidies granted to European farmers and the complex system of agricultural tariffs. I believe that the report ought to have also mentioned that EU agricultural policy has been entirely subject, ever since 1995, to the World Trade Organisation’s regulations, as well as that by decoupling this aid and allocating it to rural measures, the European Union has successfully transferred 88% of the aid granted to the WTO’s green box.</p>
      <p sl="ro">European Union manufacturers are obliged to comply with the highest quality, product hygiene and environmental standards. These factors must be taken into account whenever Parliament mentions our agricultural subsidies and the attitudes of our trade partners to them.</p>

It is regrettable that China continues to apply non-tariff barriers that limit European companies’ presence in the Chinese market, giving rise to additional costs without creating opportunities for trade. Non-tariff barriers, breaches of intellectual property rights and human rights abuses remain among the biggest problems to solve.</p>

Secondly, if China were a trusted partner, we should hope that negotiations and agreements would resolve this imbalance. Thirdly, even the Chinese communists have grasped the fact that investment without ideology in Africa is more effective than development assistance conditional on the adoption of the ideology of the donor. Fourthly, had we not lived in debt for years, maybe we could have done something, but since China provides us with credit, we can only talk about it, and then only quietly.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, our report calls on the European Union and China to base economic relations on partnership and mutual benefits. I support this call. Striking a balance in mutual trade would lead to shared development as a result of mutual benefits. Despite clear progress, however, existing trade barriers still make it impossible to exploit the potential for economic cooperation. European companies still face a range of tariff and non-tariff barriers which hamper access to Chinese markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular lack the capacity to deal with the bureaucratic certification requirements or to take part in public tenders.</p>
      <p sl="cs">European consumers, on the other hand, are interested in the safety of the Chinese products flowing onto the common European market. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation with the Chinese authorities in the area of health protection.

Europe and China can move towards developing an equal and balanced partnership only through mutual cooperation and a coordinated approach.</p>

It is now seen by Europe’s major companies, first, as one of the world’s essential sources of scarce and rare resources and, second, as an opportunity to pursue the accumulation process elsewhere, bypassing difficulties with profiting from their capital domestically that result from the compression of the wages and the purchasing power of the bulk of Europe’s population.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to answer a couple of questions that have been raised in this very interesting debate on a most interesting report.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to solar panels, we have already had contacts with the industry on this and when we receive a justified complaint – and we have not yet received one – we will consider appropriate action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, several Members of Parliament have raised the issue of a level playing field. We all agree that there should be a level playing field, but the question is how do you get there? Is it by taking action when appropriate but also keeping your own markets open, or is it by closing your own markets? And what would be the result of these differing strategies? I am very clearly in favour of having open markets, but also being tough when necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">That leads me to the market economy status. In fact, when you look at the conclusions of the latest EU-China summit, you will see there is a very clear link made between market economy status and export credits. What we are, in effect, saying is that we should make progress on both issues and China will have to move forward on export credits. They have promised that they will reach a multilateral agreement by 2014. I am greatly looking forward that. Qualifying for market economy status is a matter of meeting criteria, and if we want to be serious with this, we have to recognise they have not yet met these criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Market economy status is not something that you can grant all of a sudden; this is a matter entailing a codecision procedure in which the European Parliament will also have its say if a conclusion is ever reached.</p>
      <p sl="en">The investment agreement was also discussed at the latest summit, and we – China and ourselves – agreed to open negotiations. For the first time ever, China has recognised that negotiations should concern not only investment protection, but also market access. We at the European Commission are preparing negotiating directives, and we hope and expect that the Chinese will do the same when approaching their state council.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last point on trade. Because people always focus on imports coming from China, I would like to make two remarks. First, there are also a lot of exports going to China; China is a very important market for us. Second, we should not forget that a large part of these imports are beneficial for our own economy because they concern products that we then re-export. We therefore have to import a lot to re-export afterwards, and a big part of these semi-finished products come from China.</p>
      <p sl="en">In summary: a very interesting report; a very fruitful debate; a very complicated country but also with a lot of prospects.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank all those who have voiced their opinions during this debate. Ultimately, they have allowed us to hear the concerns of European citizens. Europeans are concerned about China’s considerable influence in the global economy, its seemingly endless supply of low cost labour, the irresistible attraction it represents for investors and the risk it poses for the delocalisation of production, and rightly so. It is essential that we recognise this here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore important that we act, obviously not by closing borders but by showing what a heavyweight we really are, namely, the primary economic power in the world that is entering into dialogue with China as an equal, not reluctantly but with confidence and conviction, in order to find a balanced approach, means for reciprocity and conditions for fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need a new partnership with China that will facilitate a return to growth for Europe in the future and, in addition, economic development in China, with the view that this will help to advance freedoms in China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore demand a great deal from China. We must speak with a single voice in our dealings with China in order to achieve balanced trade relations. Yet I think that we Europeans have our fair share of work to do. We must have a European strategy, particularly for production, for reindustrialisation and for research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United States has a strategy. They protect, Commissioner, entire swathes of their economy. China has a strategy. I am calling for the European Union to have a strategy too, not simply a defensive one but an offensive strategy aimed at moving forwards, one demanding fairer relations and, at the same time, working in our own territory on production, on wealth creation and protecting whole sectors for economic development, mirroring what giants such as the United States are doing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union is the main market for Chinese exports. They rose by 39.5% between 2009 and 2010 alone. On the other hand, China is the EU’s number two trade partner. Furthermore, during the current sovereign debt crisis, China has played an important role through investments made in infrastructure programmes in Greece and its obvious readiness to provide financial support to Spain and Portugal. Therefore, we can no longer talk about an emerging economy, but about a global economic player.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I think that Europe’s strategy on China needs to be reviewed so that it incorporates both the opportunities provided by China’s rapid global ascent and the economic challenges which they entail. It is time to consolidate a partnership based on mutual benefit and, by extension, abandon the competitive mentality. At the same time, the Chinese economy is still failing to fulfil the criteria for a market economy, which makes it difficult for European operators to do business in the Chinese market. This is why I think that the World Trade Organisation is the institutional forum which can be used to redress this situation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The EU’s trade deficit with China is on a path of unstoppable growth. Over a 10-year span, it has more than tripled, jumping from EUR 50 billion to EUR 170 billion. This immense imbalance can only partly be explained by China being more competitive in terms of labour costs. As indicated in the report, this Asian country and the companies operating there engage in several forms of conduct contrary to international trade law and practices in order to gain further competitive advantages.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ever since its accession to the WTO, China has been its greatest beneficiary and the true winner in globalisation. However, WTO membership entails not only benefits but also responsibilities. It is unacceptable that Beijing is supporting companies that produce for export by various means, such as through an export credit scheme. The US has recently adopted protective measures against Chinese dumping. The EU must protect European jobs, and should act with similar strictness against illegal imports.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is, for example, in the interest of the entire global economy that the Chinese Government stop keeping yuan exchange rates at artificially low levels in order to assist export companies. European enterprises that intend to export to China, including, in particular, distributors of agricultural products such as meat, are facing several technical and legal barriers that are unusual in international practice. China should create a predictable and transparent regulatory environment for third-country companies intending to export there.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In view of the significant disparity in bilateral trade between the EU and China, we think it absolutely essential to take appropriate steps to ensure full application of the reciprocity principle in EU-China economic relations. One source of this disparity is the way the Chinese State favours its own economy by creating certain difficulties for investors from the EU, such as by restricting the form in which it is possible to set up joint-venture businesses in China. This often serves as a protectionist measure because it debars foreign investors from becoming majority shareholders in Chinese companies and forces them to transfer technology, a practice which reduces the competitiveness of EU businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another serious problem is the question of respect for intellectual property rights (IPRs). Until China introduces legislation which guarantees the protection of IPRs, the conditions for competition on an equal basis will not exist. Furthermore, I would like to point out that there are no substantive grounds for China to deplore the existence of supposed EU barriers in the form of agricultural subsidies for farmers or agricultural tariffs, bearing in mind that a whole range of analogous legal instruments exists on the Chinese side.

      <p sl="de">Europe is taking the approach of establishing partnerships based on reciprocity with the aim of strengthening economic growth. Therefore, we must call on China to liberalise its trade even further and to open up its markets. The moves in this direction have been evaluated in the report as being inadequate because the investment conditions and the access to the Chinese market for European companies do not offer the same benefits that the EU gives to Chinese businesses. For this reason, we need to negotiate an ambitious and balanced investment agreement with China, in order to create a better environment for European investors there. It is important that the barriers which block access to the Chinese market are removed. We must ensure that China follows the World Trade Organisation rules in order to promote fair relations between the EU and China.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Union needs to redefine its relations with China, a country which, in a relatively short time, has become a key international player in almost every field. The key to bilateral relations between Europe and China should be partnership founded on reciprocity. On this basis, China could expect Europe to allow it equal and unrestricted access to its investment and public procurement markets, and this would benefit European consumers. However, the European Union must also demand the same rights for European investors and businesses operating in the Chinese market, and this means making it possible for them to receive the right training, orientation and support in looking for partners, and assistance in solving particular problems. In my opinion, these functions should be performed actively and without discrimination by appropriate units of the EU’s diplomatic service in China.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, the European Union will only have the opportunity to compete with China on an equal basis when it invests fully in scientific research and innovation, and so is able to develop the sectors whose products are most in demand on the Chinese market. The transfer of technology to China should always be compensated by the creation of innovations which will ensure permanent and sustainable demand for European industrial production. This should be given special consideration in the process of negotiating the financial allocations for particular sectors in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for her in-depth and meticulous analysis of trade relations between the European Union and China. The results of indiscriminately opening the European market to Chinese goods are there for all to see: relocations and massive job losses in Europe; average annual Chinese growth of 9% while European countries suffer a serious recession; the impotence of European trade policy; and not forgetting that 83% of counterfeit goods seized at the EU’s external borders come from China. In light of all this, we need to respond by asking for at least a certain level of reciprocity from the Chinese in very sensitive sectors such as public procurement and service provision.</p>

      <p sl="pl">China’s economic potential has made it one of the European Union’s most important trading partners. Trade between the EU and China has shown three decades of continuous growth, giving both partners a high share of world trade. There is, however, one aspect of trade relations to which we should pay particular attention. For almost 15 years, there has been an imbalance in bilateral trade. This has been to the advantage of only one side, China, and it means that the trade deficit amounts to around EUR 170 billion in China’s favour.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament should call the attention of the Commission to the need to apply the reciprocity principle in the EU’s common trade policy with China. Only in this way will we minimise the lack of full and fair competition caused by the fact that the Chinese economy does not fulfil the criteria of a market economy. Furthermore, the Union should require China to adopt international standards for products and services, which will foster transparency in bilateral trade and help improve the safety of products manufactured in China for European consumers. The growing imbalance in trade with China is a warning for the Union which demonstrates that without respect for the reciprocity principle in bilateral relations, Europe will become nothing more than an outlet for Chinese products and not a partner for the dynamically developing Chinese economy. This is why it is so important to restore the health of EU-China bilateral trade.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For a number of years now, the lights have been green for China’s economy, with a record trade surplus, higher than average currency reserves and a spectacular growth rate. At a time when global growth is slow, this dynamism should be a cause for celebration. However, on the contrary, it has given rise to concerns in Europe, as the Chinese miracle seems to be detrimental to our own economic development. While China is taking full advantage of the globalised economy by exporting its products and winning European public contracts, it is reluctant to allow the same to occur in its own territory. It reserves its public contracts for Chinese companies and prevents our key industries from agreeing to significant technological transfers in order to access Chinese private markets; we are therefore at risk of shooting ourselves in the foot! For this reason, the EU must put a stop to this naive trade relationship and act in a concerted fashion to impose the principle of reciprocity in its trade relations. If China wishes to continue to benefit from our market of 500 million consumers, it must adhere to international rules (open markets, intellectual property rights, free exchange rates), which it agreed to upon joining the WTO in 2001.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission: Trade agreement between the EU, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru, on the other part, by Vital Moreira, Bernd Lange and Mário David, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade (O-000107/2012 - B7-0114/2012).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I believe it is clear that trade is not an end in itself but a means of improving people’s living conditions. A glance at the situation in Colombia and Peru shows that the process of improving living conditions there involves major challenges.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, Parliament is, of course, investigating very carefully, on the basis of the rights granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, whether this trade agreement with Colombia and Peru meets these requirements. It is very unlikely that the trade agreement alone will be able to overcome these challenges. The issues include the extent to which civil society is included in the process of implementing the trade agreement, the independence of its involvement and the options for instigating complaint procedures. There is also the question of the restrictions placed on efforts to implement the sustainability chapter. Article 267 and Article 277 specify the possible restrictions relating to material resources. We believe it is necessary for us to enter into additional agreements with the Colombian and the Peruvian governments so that we can be certain that the trade agreement will bring about significant improvements in the living conditions of the people.</p>
      <p sl="de">One aspect of this involves improving the employment rights of people who are working in the informal sector. Around 58% of people in Colombia, for example, are employed in the informal sector and their working conditions are quite different from those of people with formal jobs. The question of how the interests of workers are represented must be reconsidered, in particular, in the light of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions 129 and 135. Job security and social dialogue also need to be improved in line with ILO Convention 144.</p>
      <p sl="de">The United States and Switzerland have put in place action plans to accompany their free trade agreements and we should follow their example.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, why (you may ask) this oral question and resolution when this Parliament has the task of voting to give or withhold its consent? Because a trade agreement is also a political instrument and we wanted to have an opportunity to discuss politics and our foreign relations with these countries which soon will be closer to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think this is a good agreement for both the European Union and our Andean partners and we strongly support it. We trust this agreement will help our partner countries on their path to economic growth and development, contributing to fighting poverty, promoting social cohesion and sustainable development. We strongly believe this agreement will help to improve the general perception, here in Europe, of Colombia in particular, which has been criticised by persons who still look at it as if it was the same country it used to be in the 1990s, in the last millennium.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the one and only truth is that Colombia has changed. It has dramatically changed for the better. We Europeans must keep on supporting these changes by approaching our friends, not by repelling them. By supporting nations, governments, and politicians, we are sharing the same values – as we do. By being nearer to our partner countries, we are helping their citizens. This is the only known way to make a better and fairer world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also suggest that our partner countries should create a transparent and binding road map, possibly with the support of the Commission, regarding human labour rights and sustainable development. We also want to see both in Peru and Colombia the establishment of permanent institutionalised mechanisms that guarantee the role of civil society. In an open and free society, civic organisations have the right to be heard, but then it is up to the democratically elected governments to make their choices and assume their responsibilities. The role of civic forums is not to replace governments, particularly when they are democratically elected governments, as is the case in both countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two last remarks: firstly, to express our highest admiration to both Colombia and Peru for a notable improvement of the general living standards of their citizens. A special word for President Juan Manuel Santos, who is changing very rapidly a country that lived for decades with an armed conflict, violence and impunity, corruption and drug trafficking. President Santos will be remembered for what he is presently doing in Colombia, be it in the fields of human rights, labour activists, sustainable development or indigenous peoples’ rights. Nevertheless, despite these Herculean efforts, change takes time.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, a final word to express my deep disappointment at the fact that apparently, this Parliament did not accept an invitation from the Congresses of both Colombia and Peru to participate in two hearings with an MEP delegation from all political groups. I hope that it can be more than just the two rapporteurs who will go there. It would be particularly important for colleagues to see the realities through their own eyes. Some would certainly be surprised at how the reality is much better than the perception they have.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the protection of human rights is already central to our relationship with Colombia and Peru, precisely because we have long used our cooperation programmes to further human rights in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights is a priority area of focus under the 2007-2013 Country Strategy Paper for Colombia and we are undertaking a broad range of measures under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, covering labour rights, women’s rights, the rights of indigenous people and the rights of children and youth more broadly.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, we have actions promoting the reintegration into society of child soldiers and street children in Colombia. We are working to support the right to join and form trade unions, also in Colombia; and we have projects to support the implementation of Convention 169 of the International Labour Organisation on the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, in both Colombia and Peru.</p>
      <p sl="en">In total, we have already spent some EUR 50 million in this area. But the politically relevant fact behind these figures is that, as in all areas, Europe’s assistance is demand driven. This means that we are not simply pursuing values that we cherish: we are pursuing the objectives that our partners identify as priorities. So not only the European Union but also Colombia – and Peru for that matter – have set the improvement of human and labour rights as a priority on our bilateral cooperation agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we all know that cooperation is not sufficient. It needs to be matched by appropriate international commitments, and so it is. It is an undisputed fact that Colombia has acceded to all core ILO labour standards. The issue in the past has been about implementation of the standards on the physical safety of trade unionists, and the legal framework for trade union activity, but today it must also be an undisputed fact that the situation has improved enormously.</p>
      <p sl="en">The incidence of violence against trade unionists has decreased considerably. The government’s protection programme for people under threat, including many trade unionists, has been completely overhauled. There are now higher levels of prosecution and conviction, and police and judicial capacities have been strengthened. The government has also moved to eliminate legal and practical obstacles to freedom of association and collective bargaining, for example, by reducing the scope for outsourcing and labour intermediation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legislation regulating strikes has been reformed, incorporating important international principles into the national legislation, such as making decisions on the legality of strikes the responsibility of the courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Peru, for its part, has implemented the key ILO conventions, and Peruvian law now provides a good framework for the right of association. The number of trade unions registered nationwide is increasing, although more effort is needed to increase their representativeness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although all of this progress is impressive, the situation is not yet as it should be. Indeed, the Vice-Presidents of both countries admitted as much when they travelled to Brussels to speak to the Committee on International Trade (INTA Committee) earlier this year. But I also want to make very clear that we would do no service to human or labour rights in either country by rejecting this agreement, because one of the core objectives of the agreement has been, precisely, to reinforce these positive developments. Allow me to illustrate this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, civil society organisations and citizens have an important role in the implementation of the agreement. Both countries and the European Union will have to set up advisory groups of civil society representatives, including a balanced representation of economic, social and environmental interests. Those groups must be regularly consulted by governments about how the agreement is being put into practice, and they will also be able to make recommendations on their own initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concretely, there will be regular intergovernmental meetings, and on every occasion we will have to hold an open session where all civil society organisations and citizens can directly raise issues. All decisions and reports that governments make must be public. What this means is that civil society will help us in the Commission, and you in Parliament, to oversee the implementation of the provisions – on sustainable development in particular, but also the rest of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the agreement establishes a transparent, predictable and comprehensive mechanism to ensure implementation of core labour and environmental conventions. It establishes an arbitration system to deal with disagreements on trade and sustainable development. This can be triggered by the European Union, Colombia or Peru – regardless of whether the country targeted agrees. Once it has been set in motion, it will follow a fixed set of procedural steps and deadlines. A group of impartial and independent experts will study the matter to see if the country has lived up to its legal commitments under the agreement. They will then issue a full public report of their findings of fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">I consider this system more, rather than less, effective than the general dispute settlement mechanism which applies to other parts of the agreement. True, it does not provide for the usual retaliatory mechanisms, like raising tariffs, but these would be counterproductive. They do not encourage permanent changes in a country’s policies, and too often they end up harming those they are intended to protect.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the arbitration procedure does not have to wear the straitjacket imposed by the regular dispute settlement mechanism. There is no obligation to prove that problematic measures have an effect on trade. That means that we will be in a position to open arbitration procedures in a much wider range of cases. This is far more consistent with the objectives and the rationale behind our trade and sustainable development chapters.</p>
      <p sl="en">As if all this were not enough, the procedure is, in any case, backed up by the human rights clause. The very first article of the text states that respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and fundamental human rights is an essential element of the agreement. If a government violates this essential element, the European Union, Colombia or Peru would be able immediately to suspend the benefits of the agreement to that government’s country. I do not see how this could be expressed more clearly or more strongly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, I know that some in this House are in favour of establishing some sort of action plan on implementation with Colombia, as the USA has done. But the situation is not identical. The US-Colombia free trade agreement does not contain a human rights clause, which is why an action plan is necessary in their case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nothing that you could put in any action plan would be as effective as what is already in our agreement with Colombia and Peru, and this could have a broader impact than you might think. If we were unilaterally to impose additional binding mechanisms ex post, our partners could question the good faith of our negotiating positions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore urge you to look closely at this agreement – to examine it in great detail – because I think that when you do so, you will be fully reassured as to the balances it strikes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the situation relating to human rights and the rule of law in Colombia and Peru needs further improvement. However, instead of focusing our attention only on the remaining problems, we must take into account the reality of life in these countries and look at the ongoing improvements made over recent years. Colombia and Peru have been struggling for years with varying levels of success and in the face of significant resistance from within their own countries in some areas to resolve their outstanding problems and to meet human rights requirements.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am firmly convinced that we must help the countries of South America in what they are trying to achieve and develop the flow of trade between us even further. Trade in goods and services not only brings economic benefits, but, most importantly, it also encourages people in Europe and South America to interact. This interaction is an essential means of gaining an even deeper understanding of the importance and the absolute value of the rule of law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I am very pleased, Mr De Gucht, that the Commission has been able to give a satisfactory answer to the questions we have asked and shares my view that the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is currently in the consent procedure, represents an important step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have no doubt that the trade agreement should be judged, above all, on its merits as regards the prosperity and well-being of the citizens, workers and companies of the EU. However, it is also true that external trade policy cannot be taken in isolation from the EU’s international human rights policy. I also believe the European Union cannot only conclude trade agreements with countries that observe such high human rights defence and protection policies as the EU. Nevertheless, I believe that, when we conclude international trade agreements with countries with problematic human rights situations, we should ensure that these agreements at least contribute to improving the existing situation and have a positive impact on human rights in those countries. That is why this oral question is important: knowing whether, aside from the commercial merits – which I do not consider in doubt – of this international trade agreement with Colombia and Peru, it also contributes positively to improving the human rights situation in those two countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, at a time when we are all struggling with rising unemployment and falling exports, I understand the need for access to new markets for European companies, and I understand the need and desire to support the Commission in its efforts to achieve this. However, the European Union has always fought, and will always fight, for more than merely its economic interests abroad. Our Treaties commit us to supporting democracy, human rights and environmental protection – not just on paper, but in practice – in everything we do, both within the Union and through our external relations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Colombia is a country where deforestation, water pollution and biodiversity loss remain serious problems. The Colombian Government has introduced environmental legislation but, as the Commission’s own sustainable impact assessment has shown, the capacity to properly enforce this is lacking. Ratifying the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) at this point, without proper environmental enforcement in place, will result in increased pressure, more damage to the environment and more destruction to the livelihoods of rural population groups in Colombia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Paragraph 6 of this oral question requires a thorough response from the Commission. It must spell out the steps that it will take together with the Colombian Government to safeguard the natural environment, before this FTA comes into force. We have commitments, too, that civil society groups will help monitor the FTA, so we must ensure that those groups are free to speak out and that they represent the peoples most at threat from development, especially the indigenous peoples of the forests.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are to be a leader in high human and environmental standards throughout the world, we must lead with really binding resolutions, and with clear and strong actions to safeguard core European values. I will support this FTA only when I see those actions coming into force. Until then, I cannot support a treaty where actions on the environment and human rights remain just an aspiration.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the discussions about the agreement with Colombia and Peru show that human rights are important. I want to talk about the issues of freedom of expression, the right to knowledge and the right to education. The agreement which the EU has negotiated with Colombia and Peru, together with several other agreements that have been imposed on these countries, includes significant obligations with regard to intellectual property rights and inflexible trade regulations, while failing to put in place equivalent restrictions on the monopolies which these rights involve.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In Colombia, this has resulted in an act such as making a private copy of a document or making a limited number of copies for educational purposes becoming a criminal offence.</p>

We need agreements which introduce and reinforce restrictions on copyright at an international level.

And I think, Mr President, that Parliament should convey its condemnation, warmth and solidarity to Colombian society as a whole and the victims’ families during these difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has made it abundantly clear, Mr President, that we should not emphasise an ongoing dynamic of demands that has not been imposed on other countries that have signed up to agreements of this type. I think we should place emphasis on the fact that this agreement is a clear and predictable framework to try to overcome a regime of unilateral concessions, which I want to remind my colleagues already exists, is in force, and is going to affect trade, investments and services.</p>
      <p sl="es">And in this context, I am greatly surprised that many Members in this House state that they have doubts about this agreement, but that they do not have doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua, with which the European Union has reached the same type of agreement, or in Mexico, where we all know about the rates of violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">What is true, Mr President, is that this agreement is going to put Peru and Colombia on an equal footing with other countries that benefit from the same facilities, as is clearly the case with Chile, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Israel and the CARICOM nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, Mr President, that the European Union, its 27 Member States, the Commission, Peru and Colombia have signed this agreement, and I believe that we are falling into the trap of a paternalism exercise if we tell our partner countries what is good for them or what is no longer good for them. I think they are mature enough to know that they want this agreement because the European Union is a useful partner.</p>

Among the most significant indicators, I would highlight the ongoing and reciprocal dialogue about human rights, that was established voluntarily in 2009, and the ratification of fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also necessary to mention the victims’ law, the return of land, the protection programme for those in danger, which already encompasses 11 000 people, and the increase in resources devoted to investigating the crimes of which union members and human rights campaigners have been victims.</p>

But I would like the Commissioner to take this up directly with the International Trade Union Congress, to try to persuade them that there is sufficient cover in this for them to buy into it, because the human rights situation is such that a lot of Members in this House who would like to see the agreement signed still have concerns; we want to see momentum, and protection, for people who have the right to organise.</p>

      <p sl="en">To the Commissioner, who tells us again tonight of undoubted improvement, I say that I agree there has been an improvement in language. How does he respond, however, to the International Committee of the Red Cross which says that last year, human rights violations got worse in Colombia, or to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court who says this is one of three countries in the world with the worst levels of international crime?</p>
      <p sl="en">On the proposed action plan, I pay tribute to Catherine Bearder and the amendment she is putting forward: I hope we will support it. But I ask my friend Mr Lange, and all the Members of the House, to recognise that the American National Trade Union Federation says the Colombian Government has failed to comply with their action plan, so Europe must do better – not simply by ensuring benchmarks which are really binding, but also through the same dispute mechanism for human rights as for trade complaints and, crucially, we must see concrete implementation before, not after, parliamentary ratification.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, three weeks ago after taking part in a demonstration, Daniel Aguirre Piedrahita, the General Secretary of the Colombian sugar cane workers’ union, was assassinated in cold blood, leaving a wife and three young daughters. He is one of 61 trade unionists assassinated since President Santos came to power, so I ask all colleagues, in dealing with this issue, to show proper respect for those who have suffered most.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we have the opportunity to discuss this planned free trade agreement today. Despite all the outstanding problems in some countries and in Colombia in particular, we must not forget what the situation was like here just a few years ago. We did not start from a blank slate. Only a few years ago, Colombia was in an extremely difficult position which involved major problems with terrorism. The most recent governments have done a great deal to improve the living conditions of the people. Anyone who claims that there have not been dramatic improvements in Colombia in recent years is simply not speaking the truth.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it is important that the situation continues to develop and that further improvements are introduced. However, it is clear to all of us when we look at our position here in Europe that we cannot resolve all of our problems overnight either. Improvements take time. A great deal has already been achieved, for example, with regard to democracy and to security and the dramatic improvements in this area, with regard to the measures to combat terrorism and with regard to trade unionists, a subject referred to by the previous speaker. I believe that the protection programme for trade unionists established by the Colombian Government is unprecedented. Unfortunately, it has not yet succeeded in putting a stop to the murders. Sadly, people are still being murdered here in Europe as well. We must not dismiss the improvements that have been made. Much has been done for trade unionists and trade union officials in Colombia in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">What should our response be? Should we close the door on these countries? Should we say that, despite the huge improvements over the last few years, they have, in our opinion, simply not done enough? Should we say that all the negotiations have been wasted? Should we say that we do not recognise all the improvements? Should we say that we do not want to maintain the dialogue and keep the lines of communication open in future? If we really want to work together to help the governments in both countries to improve the living conditions of their people, then, in my opinion, trade is a part of this process. We also need to open up our market in Europe to products from Colombia and Peru and give these countries the opportunity to become more prosperous. We need to lay the foundations for further improvements in the everyday lives of the people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, given all the work still to be completed in these countries, I believe that the action plan referred to in the motion for a resolution is a positive step. However, I would like to ask all the Members of this House not to focus on the outstanding problems. We must help the people of Colombia, but, most importantly, we should also take into account the fact that in recent years, a lot has been achieved for the benefit of the people in these countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank both the European Commission and the governments of Colombia and Peru for the great efforts made to successfully reach this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">I give my full support to an agreement that will undoubtedly benefit both regions, both Colombia and Peru, and will help to improve human rights conditions in Colombia.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement is an example for a key region for the European Union, as is South America. I am concerned about another agreement, however, one that the Commission is about to start negotiating. The Commission should show that it roundly defends the legal security of the investments that are made, which are so important in improving trade flow between both parties.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to ask Commissioner De Gucht about the measures being considered when it comes to the Repsol YPF issue. As has been the case with the agreement with Colombia and Peru which we are debating here, the best guarantee to reach a possible successful agreement with Mercosur would be a strong and decisive response from the European Union when it comes to the Repsol case.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should not allow our allies on the other side of the Atlantic to be more robust than we are when it comes to an issue that affects Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the trade agreements which the EU signs with other countries provide an important means of strengthening economic relations. At the same time, they must support democratic trends, sustainable development and respect for human rights. European citizens have expectations in this area. They are paying ever-increasing attention to the origin of the products they use and to the way in which they have been made. With regard to Colombia and Peru, the trade agreement must be able to bring about a qualitative change in areas such as economic growth and social cohesion. I, too, call on the Commission to table measures aimed at ensuring that the EU’s actions have a positive, lasting impact in the partner countries. I would like to know, in particular, whether specific measures have been implemented with the aim of protecting the rights of women and children.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr De Gucht, Mr Caspary, it is a fact that, despite improvements in the legislation, trade unionists in Colombia are still being murdered. The gap between the reality and the standards is widening. In 2010, 49 trade unionists were murdered. Mr Howitt has given us the figures for 2011 and there has been no improvement. Therefore, we need an effective sustainability chapter.</p>
      <p sl="de">The free trade agreement states that the relevant international standards must be complied with. What does this mean? The agreement does not contain a list of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions in question. Furthermore, in contrast with the agreement with South Korea, there is no reference to fair and ethical trade. This is a major omission, particularly because there are no structures in place for social dialogue or for dialogue with civil society. This means that we need a mandatory action plan covering compliance with labour standards.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, we are, of course, in favour of trade agreements, but, in particular, fair and balanced trade agreements, which ensure the protection of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we consider the sustainable development chapter, it looks extremely weak and is not binding. The exception is the conflict resolution mechanism, and civil society can only give an opinion on its contents, but not on the Free Trade Agreement as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">Colombia and Peru first need to fulfil certain conditions prior to ratification, among which are: proven improvements in human rights; to return lands to the farmers; effective demobilisation of the paramilitaries; cooperation with European justice; abandonment of the military justice reform, which writes a blank cheque for impunity; and, of course, protection of indigenous villages.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is also a need to revise the financial services chapters, which are allowing authorisation of what is being restricted in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the questions that have been drafted by the authors are very apt and to the point. However, I would have added another question: how does the Commission intend to reduce the number of children used as farm labourers in both countries? The latest statistical surveys available indicate that in Peru, more than 2 million children aged between 6 and 14, amounting to 29% of all children in this age group, are used to carry out different types of work. Of these, 70% – 1.4 million children – work in agriculture. Colombia has also seen a sharp rise in the number of children used to do work. In fact, a minimum of 1 million children were employed in 2009, most of them in agriculture. Therefore, this issue should feature on the agenda of the official discussions with the two states, in addition, of course, to the other issues raised here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to reiterate what some colleagues have already said, which is that the human rights situation in Colombia has not improved as it should have done. We have had, this year alone, 13 assassinations of human rights defenders, which is almost half as many again as in 2011. So we cannot really say that the situation is good. I am in favour of a dialogue and I do not mind having agreements with countries, but we really have to see what we can do as the European Union to improve the human rights situation, specifically.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I am concerned about is that, according to a recent study by the German unions, in comparison with the EU-Korea agreement, this free trade agreement with Colombia we are negotiating only makes recommendations on certain criteria and there are no obligations. For example, labour and environmental conventions only have to be implemented when there are enough resources. I would like to know from Mr De Gucht whether he is in favour of an action plan, which many people here are calling for, prior to ratification of the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to go as quickly as possible because we are already over time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me take as a starter the question of whether I agree that we should have another agreement before we can vote on the ratification of the trade agreement with Colombia and Peru. I do not think so, because what some are, in fact, asking the European Commission is to restart negotiations with Colombia on a road map which would probably take another six months. We would then have to translate it into 23 languages, which would take another six months.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement was, in fact, concluded with Colombia more than two years ago; we now have to come to terms with this. I have outlined in detail the provisions of the agreement, I am not going to repeat them. There is also a very clear human rights clause in the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I expect the European Parliament to follow up what happens once the agreement has been ratified; the Commission will do the same. We have a lot of possibilities to steer the process; it would not be a good idea to restart discussions at this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is everything perfect in Colombia and Peru? It is not, but I have the conviction that much has changed for the better. Secondly, the politicians in both countries are serious when they claim that they are trying to resolve sometimes very difficult and long-standing situations. I think we have an honourable partnership with them in this enterprise for the better. I hope that the Parliament will give its assent to what we have proposed.</p>

      <p sl="es">I would first like to make it clear that I consider this trade agreement between the EU, Colombia and Peru essential for optimising the relationships between those countries and the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, and as stated by the oral question we are debating today, there are still some issues that cause a certain level of concern, especially when it comes to respect for human rights. Colombia has undoubtedly made significant efforts in this area, such as the closure of the controversial DAS (intelligence agency) or the approval of the Law for Victims and Return of Lands, which is viewed favourably in Parliament. All the same, there are still threats to the exercising of labour rights and union representation.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all those reasons, we think it would help tremendously if the Commission proposed mechanisms to ensure that the trade agreements lead to real progress in terms of development, human rights and workers’ rights. In this sense, the most demanding clauses allow for immediate and unilateral suspension in the case of severe violations of human rights. This new agreement will help to contribute to strengthen our strategic association with Latin America, one of the most similar regions to Europe in terms of culture and politics.</p>
