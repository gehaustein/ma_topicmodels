    <intervention id="4-007" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Nikiforos Diamandouros" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Ombudsman">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this opportunity to address Parliament on my Annual Report for 2006. I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, and the Committee on Petitions, for their excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman’s role. I received 3 830 complaints in 2006. That means that the total number of complaints has stabilised at around the level reached following the 53% increase in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am delighted to inform you that the proportion of complaints falling within the mandate has gone up. This suggests that citizens are beginning to have a better knowledge both of my mandate and of that of my national and regional colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen, which is thus commensurately strengthened to the benefit of all concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The total number of inquiries dealt with in 2006 was 586. Of these, 66% concerned the Commission. Given that the Commission is the EU institution with which citizens have most reason to have material contact, it is normal that it should be the principal target of inquiries.</p>
      <p sl="en">During 2006, 250 decisions closing inquiries were made. In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration. Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned. Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by the institutions. If so, I point them out in a further remark.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of my inquiries result in a win-win outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against. During 2006, 64 cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whenever I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution, if possible. Three friendly solutions were achieved in 2006 and a further 27 proposals for such a solution were under consideration by the institution concerned at the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark, or make a draft recommendation. A critical remark is appropriate if it is no longer possible for the institution concerned to eliminate the instance of maladministration. I wish to emphasise that the criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future. In 2006, I closed 41 inquiries in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">To better monitor the impact of my criticism and advice, I have this year launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks made in 2006, as well as to the 38 cases involving a further remark made during the same year. The results of these studies should provide further encouragement to the institutions concerned to improve their practices and develop a culture of service to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution, which must respond with a detailed opinion. During 2006, 13 draft recommendations were made.</p>
      <p sl="en">If an institution fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, I may send a special report to the European Parliament. Two special reports were made in 2006. The first concerned the Council’s responsibility for the choice of languages used in its Presidency websites. The second called on the Commission to deal properly with an infringement complaint concerning sports betting services. I am pleased to report that the Commission reacted promptly and positively to that report.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new feature of the Annual Report which I wish to highlight, with an eye to supporting and encouraging good administration, concerns what I call ‘star cases’ of good practice by institutions, revealed through my inquiries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to mention some other activities that I have undertaken during 2006 with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Our agreement aims to ensure the consistent treatment of complaints that raise issues of data protection and to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement allows me to benefit from the expertise of the EDPS by consulting him in cases where the text of the Data Protection Regulation and existing case-law leave room for divergent views. This has already proved to be a useful mechanism for me when dealing with cases in which it is necessary to reconcile the legal right of access to documents with the right to privacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also signed an agreement with the Spanish Government to enable citizens to complain to the European Ombudsman in any of the co-official languages in Spain. I thus aligned my practice with the conclusions reached in June 2005 by the Council, which provide for the use of those languages to facilitate Spanish citizens’ communication with the EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I am grateful for the support for the work of the European Ombudsman expressed in Ms Sbarbati’s report, and I would like to inform Parliament that, as requested in her report, I am already engaged in preparing the ground for a memorandum of understanding with the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given that the implementation of EU law is largely the responsibility of Member States’ administrations, I will continue to develop cooperation through the European network of ombudsmen. I am happy to inform you that the sixth meeting of the network took place last week in this very building. At the conclusion of that successful meeting, we adopted by consensus a statement that aims to make the EU dimension of the work of national and regional ombudsmen better known, and to clarify the service they provide to people who complain about matters that fall within the scope of EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The voluntary cooperation among ombudsmen that is now crystallised in the statement can, I believe, make an important and growing contribution to the European Union’s ability to deliver concrete results, by ensuring that citizens can enjoy their rights as an everyday reality and that problems are solved in ways that are close to the citizen.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Ombudsman was established to help bring the Union closer to citizens and to give the EU administration a ‘human face’. A fundamental aspect of our institution is that the Ombudsman is an individual who communicates personally with citizens, who reviews their cases, and who seeks to resolve their problems and complaints.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each one of these ‘microcommunications’ constitutes an opportunity to build trust between citizens and the institutions. In pursuit of this goal, I will continue to promote a constructive dialogue with the institutions and to draw their attention to problems so that they can improve their performance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The way in which a public administration reacts to complaints is a key measure of how citizen-focused it is. While progress has been made in many areas, the year 2006 regrettably saw a rise in the proportion of cases which I had to close with a critical remark.</p>
      <p sl="en">That should be cause for concern for anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens. Complaints offer an opportunity to put things right and to demonstrate that the institution concerned is serious about respecting the citizens’ fundamental right to good administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not sure that citizens can easily reconcile the statements often made by institutions concerning their desire to get ‘closer to the citizen’, and for ‘more openness’, with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations and increase transparency. I am positively encouraged, however, by a number of indications that, during the present year, 2007, there is a much greater willingness to take up the opportunities offered by my inquiries to resolve complaints.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such cooperation is essential, because the Ombudsman cannot succeed alone. Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the EU institutions. Delivering on promises, providing proper redress mechanisms, learning from mistakes, working openly and allowing for public scrutiny – these are the all-important ‘means’ towards building trust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, the European Ombudsman must work concertedly and systematically with national and regional colleagues to ensure that citizens’ rights are fully respected throughout the Union. Finally, the Ombudsman must continue to reach out to citizens so that they can become aware of his services.</p>
      <p sl="en">With Parliament’s support and guidance, I will continue to endeavour to build on existing achievements with a view to truly fulfilling my institutional mandate of bringing the Union closer to citizens and giving the EU administration a ‘human face’.</p>

    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="4428" name="Luciana Sbarbati" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to thank the Ombudsman for his excellent work as is borne out by this particular report. I should also like to thank the Legal Services of the Commission and all my parliamentary colleagues on the committee, especially the shadow rapporteur and Mr Mavrommatis, for their cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The culture of service to the citizen, which is primarily designed to ensure high-quality, transparent, approachable, swift and cooperative public administration, has been encouraged and strengthened at Community level by the combined efforts of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman, and its first emergence can be traced back to the resolution of 6 September 2001, the date on which the European Parliament adopted the code of good administrative conduct proposed by the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, the Treaty of Maastricht produced a qualitative leap in European citizenship by offering all citizens the possibility of submitting petitions to a parliamentary body, which remains the sole arbitrator, or applying to a more specialised body which, while operating on an extrajudicial basis, follows a procedure which does not rule out parliamentary intervention in the event of the Community institution responsible for the instance of maladministration proving reluctant to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall not talk about the statistics, as the Ombudsman has already talked about them and they are set out in the report. Cases of maladministration currently relate to lack of transparency, refusal of information, abuse of power, legal error and failure to ensure fulfilment of Treaty obligations, in particular by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Ombudsman’s decisions are not legally binding, but the safeguards that his work offers help to strengthen his powers of persuasion. He enjoys the active support of the Committee on Petitions, whose meetings he attended on four occasions in 2006, and cooperates with the network of European Ombudsmen, which should be improved and extended. Italy, for instance, does not as yet have a national Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="it">It should be nevertheless be stressed that decisions with final effect should be reciprocally notified in real time in order to avoid conflicts of competence between the activities of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report divides the decisions taken on completed inquiries in 2006 into various categories: lack of openness on the part of Community institutions and bodies (25% of inquiries), the role of the Commission as the guarantor of the Treaty in relation to procedures under Article 226, the management of contracts, remuneration and grants, and the recruitment and management of the staff of the Community institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Procedures often end at the stage of critical remarks, which are a means of attempting to prevent the recurrence of cases of maladministration in future, in cases where it would be pointless to issue a recommendation. Various examples have been given by the Ombudsman, and can be read at leisure in the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">In that respect, the Committee on Petitions invites the Ombudsman to carry out a detailed study of the practical impact of critical remarks made during inquiries in 2006. The fact that institutions have a code of good administrative conduct is often not enough to guarantee the creation of a genuine culture of service.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report also shows that there are still some grey areas in relation to the Commission making wrong use of its discretionary powers by failing to take prompt action before legal proceedings were begun, using political considerations as a pretext. With regard to contracts and staff management, some of the investigations launched by the Ombudsman on his own initiative show how his powers provide an effective means of goading the administrative authorities into self-regulation, a sound principle that needs to be put to increasing use.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the view of the Committee on Petitions, however, the lack of synchronicity in timing and views with regard to the handling of the same case by the Ombudsman and Parliament needs to be avoided through ongoing and constructive dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Committee on Petitions has also issued a special invitation to the Ombudsman to investigate the systems used by EPSO, again with a view to protecting the rights of candidates, especially young candidates, in the European Parliament’s competition procedures, and to investigate alleged discrimination reported at the European School in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this year’s report, Madam President, the focus is on the Ombudsman’s role as a key actor in the Union’s democratic life. He is a vital intermediary for citizens in their dealings with public authorities. His effective activities highlight the distinction between good and bad administration, offering guidance on recognising mistakes, and seeking satisfactory solutions for complainants, likely to transform bad conduct into good.</p>
      <p sl="it">To this end, it would be valuable if the Ombudsman were to draw up a list of best administrative practices, including not just exemplary cases, but less creditable ones as well. One of the cardinal principles that always has to be stressed is the democratic equality of all Europe’s citizens, without any distinction or discrimination on the grounds of nationality or language; something on which the Ombudsman can rely in his continuing efforts to scrutinise and protect linguistic equality.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Committee on Petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the Ombudsman’s annual report is considered more quickly, and it is also in favour of amending the Statute, provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the Ombudsman’s powers, without affecting the nature of his competences or the non-binding effect of all his decisions.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Margot Wallström" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission should ‘take a leading role in promoting a service culture’. When the Ombudsman said this in the introduction to his Annual Report, I could not agree more. The European Union needs to be closer to its citizens, to explain better, to listen better and to deliver good policies. To have a top-quality public administration is a necessary condition for that. To have a well-equipped watchdog to monitor our progress is equally important to our common success. The Ombudsman acts as an external control mechanism for sound and accountable administration on the part of the European Union institutions and bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore very much welcome the Ombudsman’s Annual Report for 2006, and I want to stress that the relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman are very positive. For example, the number of open enquiries addressed to the Commission decreased by 20% in 2006 in relation to 2005 and 2004, and we more frequently acknowledge our mistakes and apologise. We seek satisfactory solutions for complainants, just as we follow up the critical remarks and the draft recommendations of the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome Ms Sbarbati’s very important report and the constructive proposals in it. Just as I agree with the Ombudsman’s call for a service culture, I agree with Ms Sbarbati’s call for the necessary budgetary and human resources. We are judged by our deeds and not by our words, so we need to really ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses, as Ms Sbarbati says in her report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me briefly comment on a few particular points in the report. First, the Commission welcomes the Ombudsman’s initiative to draw up a list of ‘star’ cases exemplifying best practices. We also welcome this initiative to prepare a study on the follow-up given by the Commission and other institutions and bodies to the critical comments and further remarks of the Ombudsman. I hope this can contribute to improving practices to the benefit of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, regarding the alleged overlaps between the activities and powers of the Committee on Petitions and those of the Ombudsman, the Commission reiterates its willingness to work with those two bodies within the framework of their respective remit, and the definition of that remit does not fall within the Commission’s competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, Parliament has requested the Commission make proper use of its discretionary powers under Article 226 relating to infringement procedures. Of course, we should avoid delays or failure to take action, and that is why the Commission recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law, and we laid down more targeted preventive measures, improved information provision and problem solving. In short, this was the Commission’s new commitment: to seek a more efficient management of infringement cases and increased transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, as you know, the review of this Regulation is under way, and the Ombudsman’s contribution to the consultation has been very much welcomed. Only a few weeks ago we had a meeting with the Interinstitutional Committee on public access to documents which was chaired by Vice-President Wallis, and I want to thank her for taking this matter about public access to documents forward in a very constructive way.</p>
      <p sl="en">My penultimate point concerns the Ombudsman’s Statute. It is being dealt with in a separate context but, as it is mentioned in the report, I just want to assure you that the Commission closely monitors the developments, and that contacts are under way between the Commission and the Ombudsman at different hierarchical levels. I want this issue to progress in a spirit of close cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, concerning the Ombudsman’s communication strategy and the European network of Ombudsmen, we need to share experiences and administrative practices. We need to raise public awareness and to bring citizens closer to the EU. The Ombudsman has a very important stake in this, and so does the European Parliament and the Committee on Petitions. This is important to me and the whole Commission, and you can be sure that we will do our absolute best to cooperate and find good, forward-looking solutions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank and congratulate Mrs Sbarbati, the rapporteur on the annual report on the European Ombudsman’s activities in 2006. I would also like to thank the secretariat of our committee for its assistance in drawing up Mrs Sbarbati’s report, and also the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for promptly submitting his annual report for 2006 and for his subsequent cooperation with the Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Ombudsman is an independent institution and a control mechanism for the administration of the EU. However, despite all the action taken by Mr Diamandouros to inform the public, confusion still reigns over the European Ombudsman’s areas of jurisdiction. We must therefore continue to try and inform the public, with appropriate financial support from the EU. For this reason we, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have again tabled a relevant amendment, which calls for ever greater participation by the media in publicising the work of the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="el">As shadow rapporteur, I have tried to contribute to the report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, with amendments that I have tabled and supported. It was essentially through the adoption of these amendments that we saw progress in the following areas of the European Ombudsman’s activity:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, the European Ombudsman was called upon to continue with his investigation of third-pillar issues.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, reports concerning the European Ombudsman must be translated promptly into all official EU languages, particularly in the case of the European Ombudsman’s annual report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, the European Ombudsman must maintain good relations with the members of the Committee on Petitions and cooperate with them in order to achieve the desired results.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, the European Network of Ombudsmen is called upon to expand and include within its membership specialised ombudsmen such as those dealing with minors’ rights, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners’ or patients’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Diamandouros and Ms Wallström for their presentations and Ms Sbarbati for her excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Lisbon Treaty just agreed opens the door to the European Union’s exit from a long-standing phase whereby its ability to function effectively on behalf of its citizens has been held back. We have a long-needed institutional system that works more effectively, but it also opens the door to so much more.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the solemn proclamation of the Charter of the Presidents of the Institutions that will be made on 12 December. The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as part of the legal order in the European Union will allow for the Union to begin to work on more effective, transparent and democratic foundations. European citizens expect, and will continue to expect, that the Union’s institutions will act in accordance with its basic principles: with the Charter, and with efficiency, effectiveness and openness.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Ombudsman is one vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union. The largest proportion of the Ombudsman’s enquiries concern lack of transparency. This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of the citizens. I am delighted with the work of the Ombudsman, as explained in his annual report and in his speech. He took a number of important decisions during 2006, including, not least, on the choice of the languages used in the websites of the European Presidencies of the Council, on inaccurate and misleading information contained in leaflets, posters and video presentations on air passenger rights produced by the Commission, and on access to the audit report of the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman, as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions, as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures. Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require a greater investment of resources by the institutions, in order that the citizens’ concerns are properly addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context I would like to remind Members of Paragraph 2 of Ms Sbarbati’s report: ‘Calls for all European institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions’. There will be no better way of putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice than taking this on board, and I call on all the institutions and bodies to give priority to the interests of the citizens in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission Margot Wallström, Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Over the years the role of the European Ombudsman has become ever more important for the citizens of the European Union. Once the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enters into force, that role will become even more important. This means that in the future we have to be even more careful to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources and that the code of practice under which he operates is relevant to the current climate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Commissioner Margot Wallström stressed the need for transparency. I would hope that now that the code of practice under which the European Ombudsman operates is changing, the Commissioner’s words, increased transparency and promoting the idea that the necessary information is available from the Commission, will come true, because only deeds matter, not words.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Ombudsman’s annual report and its summarised version are a splendid example of how our work should be presented to the public. The report is clear, succinct and to the point. Transparency is the key to European democracy and its principal construction material.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Under Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union. That is saying a lot, and it places an obligation on all the European Union institutions and obviously on the Ombudsman’s office too. Consequently, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are adequate resources of the relevant kind in place, so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them, because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to thank the Ombudsman for the work he does, and I wish him every success in this very challenging role. It is not always appreciated sufficiently, as fundamental rights are implemented more successfully among the elite than among ordinary people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Sbarbati for her work and to express my appreciation for the achievements of the European Ombudsman, Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros. I am expressing the views of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group as well as those of Mr Marcin Libicki, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who was unable to attend today’s sitting and asked me to speak on his behalf.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Hominum causa omne ius constitutum sit – every law should be applied from the point of view of human beings. This Roman principle can be seen in the work of the Ombudsman, who, working within his area of competence, tries to comply with the fundamental principle that everyone has the right to have their case heard in an impartial and just manner by EU bodies and institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It can be seen from an analysis of the report that only about 25% of the complaints submitted fall within the scope of competence of the Ombudsman. Is it that our citizens do not know the law? Perhaps, to some extent, this is the case. However, I think that it is something different, that they treat the institution of the ombudsman as a last resort, when they are unable to find appropriate help in their own countries. The scope and quantity of applications submitted to the Committee on Petitions would indicate something similar. If the feeling that one is being treated in an unjust, sluggish, incompetent or bureaucratic way continues to grow, the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour will just become a collection of aspirations, and not everyday practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Professor, may you, as the Ombudsman, be an effective guardian of the interests of the Community’s citizens, and may Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as national parliaments and national ombudsmen, assist you in this work.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="28161" name="Margrete Auken" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="da">Madam President, I am not going to repeat all of the good things that have been said, apart from to thank both our Ombudsman and Commissioner Wallström. In addition, I would like to say something that must be underlined. I am a relatively new member of the Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, as it would be better to call it. I have, to my consternation, discovered through being out in society that it is virtually only active citizens who are monitoring whether EU legislation is being respected in many places. The institutions are not doing this, and neither are the Member States. Therefore, if citizens do not do it, the whole thing will fall apart. Therefore, citizens are not only the victims of individual cases; they are indeed also active fellow players who are working to ensure that the EU’s extremely transparent system is both understandable and close to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="da">We should also be clear that it is a perpetual battle even if we equip our instruments, i.e. the Ombudsman and the Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, with the correct tools. An attack is currently taking place on the Swedish system of openness and access to documents. We must not believe that this is a battle that we can win once and for all. We must persist and continue to persist and we will not win the battle at any point. We will win it only if we continue to have very strong tools.</p>
      <p sl="da">Let me stress that I am very pleased with Mrs Sbarbati’s report. However, I would like to highlight the amendments that we have fortunately been able to incorporate into the report thanks to considerable support. Firstly, it is now possible for Parliament to take the Ombudsman’s cases to court if the institutions do not respect the Ombudsman. It is absolutely crucial that this can be done in reality and is not simply something that we can boast about around the world. We have the institution of the Ombudsman, we have a Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, and yet this does not mean anything other than words and yet more words. This matter is therefore of enormous significance.</p>
      <p sl="da">The second aspect concerns the European Investment Bank. On many occasions the bank has not been as ‘nice’ as it should be. On many occasions it has acted as if it were assisting the major industries, and it is absolutely crucial that the citizens who should benefit from the bank’s activities in countries outside Europe have the opportunity to bring matters before the Ombudsman. It is really quite shocking that they are refused on the grounds that they are not EU citizens and are not able to have their say. They have been treated in a patronising and arrogant way, and I am therefore also very glad that it has now been highlighted in this report that these citizens will naturally have access to appeal to the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, let me say that it is important to emphasise that the Ombudsman also has competence within intergovernmental areas under the third pillar. Overall, we are taking a big step forward with this report, and I very much hope that the bodies of both the Commission and Parliament will take it seriously.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, today’s discussion and the excellent work carried out by the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, over the past four and a half years, as well as Mrs Sbarbati’s excellent report, all provide an opportunity for the European Parliament and the Commission to take stock of how the public views the institutions of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="el">A large section of the public is calling for greater transparency and exemplary administration, which are too little in evidence.</p>
      <p sl="el">I note some worrying signs in Mr Diamandouros’s report. Fewer cases have been resolved by friendly settlement. There has been a decline in the number of cases where the Commission (I see that the Vice-President is not listening) has complied with the recommendations of the European Ombusdman.</p>
      <p sl="el">Congratulating the European Ombudsman, Madam President, is not enough; we must listen to his recommendations. Mr Diamandouros is quite rightly requesting an extension of his powers to cover third-pillar issues, thus providing for greater transparency and control. He is asking for a change to the European Ombudsman’s Statute so that his work can become more effective.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe he has the support of the European Parliament, but he must also have that of the Commission, and not just in word, but also in deed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we read in Mrs Sbarbati’s report that, according to the 2006 statistics, over 90% of the 3 800 or so complaints come from individual citizens, which is a very interesting fact. Mrs Sbarbati also tells us that the majority of complaints come from the larger Member States, with larger populations, but goes on to say that the figure changes if the ratio between population and number of complaints is considered, when Luxembourg and the new accession countries Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia take the lead with the largest number of complaints. This reflects, in my view, the fact that issues of a European nature and of European competence and legislation are the main concerns of the Ombudsman’s day-to-day work.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, it is interesting to note, however, that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombudsmen in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman. I think I remember reading that in the 95% of cases examined, the majority do not fall within the mandate of the European Ombudsman, as the complaints are not made against a Community institution or body.</p>
      <p sl="it">Cases of maladministration relate to lack of transparency, unfairness, abuse of power, legal error and so on. There are no data on administrative inefficiency and injustice in my country, and I am sure that if such data existed and were brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman, Italy would be well in the lead, especially the left-wing administrations of my country.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not surprising that the wrong use of the discretionary powers of the Commission is well in the lead in the ranking, and I would therefore exhort the European Ombudsman to scrutinise relations between citizens, the Council, the Commission and Parliament more thoroughly.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also agree that the Ombudsman’s scope of investigation should be extended to cover the protection of minors, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners’ rights, and for that reason I support the Mavrommatis amendment. However, I do not support, Mrs Sbarbati and Mr Mavrommatis, the exhortation to conduct inquiries under the so-called third pillar. That is wrong, and I do not agree. I would, however, congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her productive work with the European Ombudsman.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration. Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make. This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">He makes telling comments. I want to pick out one: ‘I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get “closer to the citizen” with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.’ The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF. As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet. It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I conclude with thanks, again, not only to you, Madam President, for delighting us with your presence, but also to the Ombudsman and the Commissioner for being here as well.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, it seems we have really begun to understand how important it is that European citizens should feel close to the Union through democratic and especially transparent institutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Ombudsman is the institution par excellence for receiving citizens’ complaints. It is also the one most obviously able to make citizens feel that the Union is dealing with and responding to their problems. It shows that progress is being made in acknowledging and correcting administrative errors.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thinking behind her report. She correctly brings out the Ombudsman’s key role in the EU’s democratic character.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I am worried that although there have been fewer instances of maladministration, the Ombudsman’s critical remarks, in those cases where a friendly settlement was reached, did not meet with a satisfactory rate of acceptance by the institutional bodies.</p>
      <p sl="el">The rapporteur is right, then, to remind us of Parliament’s right of recourse to the Court, although, of course, one would prefer not to use this right. However, all of us here today should understand that we ourselves are the institutions – and the corollary of this is that the reliability of the institutions depends on our own attitude.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also agree entirely with the rapporteur’s view of a balanced but at the same time energetic way of performing one’s duties.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Ombudsman is not, cannot and should not simply be a display of democracy for the EU. We must acknowledge this, make it our joint decision, and above all, we must assume our responsibilities. In other words, we must be bold in our decisions, but above all more transparent in what is essentially our concern.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the most important aspect of the existence of the EU and its institutions is to uphold the fundamental principles of justice, democracy and respect for human rights, especially with reference to the citizens of Europe. Our Union would have no raison d’être or functional purpose if it did not have as its main objective to offer a fair, comprehensive and efficient service to the people of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European citizen was, is, and always will be, the centre of our efforts as a functioning Union. It is mainly for this reason that the activities of the Ombudsman are of such paramount importance. This is because the Ombudsman is the friend and guardian of the European citizen and is the facility through which Community institutions and bodies can be held to account over whether they have served the citizen properly and whether they are guilty of maladministration or bad practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the 2006 Annual Report from Mr Diamandouros and congratulate and thank him for the very good work he and his staff have performed in upholding the rights of European citizens. At the same time, we congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, on her excellent report, which contains many important points and suggestions. I find most interesting, for example, the suggestion made in paragraph 12, which in effect encourages the Ombudsman to draw up and publish annually a list of shame and a roll of honour for the EU’s administrative services.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I point out that the proper functioning of the Ombudsman may inevitably, in rare instances, lead him to be disliked by certain services. In such cases, the Ombudsman deserves – and must be reassured of – our full support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, may I commend the active support and cooperation the Committee on Petitions has shown the Ombudsman in the performance of his duties. The work of both those entities is very often interlinked, and their smooth cooperation is to be much appreciated and praised.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I represent Poland, a country that is in fifth position, statistically, as regards the number of complaints submitted to the European Ombudsman. Every 16th complaint submitted to the Ombudsman comes from my country. Every 20th complaint, almost, is written in Polish. Obviously I am speaking of absolute numbers, because, per inhabitant, the citizens of Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus are much more active in submitting complaints than my own countrymen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth emphasising that last year the European Ombudsman received fewer complaints than in 2005. Just over 200 complaints came from companies and associations, and 18 times more than that came from individuals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It could be said that the functioning of the European Ombudsman provides the best indicator of computer use in the European Union. Twelve out of 20 complaints are submitted electronically.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the minus side, an indicator of the lack of knowledge of EU citizens is the fact that almost four out of five complaints do not fall within the scope of responsibilities of the European Ombudsman. This shows that this institution is treated as a receptacle for all maladies, even those that do not relate to EU institutions, which, by definition, is what the European Ombudsman is supposed to monitor. Clearly Europeans feel that the European Ombudsman has the right to crack the whip over everyone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I would like to express satisfaction that only 8% of the investigations instigated by the Ombudsman related to the European Parliament, while almost 66% related to the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you Madam President. The Ombudsman’s criticism regarding a lack of transparency is necessary and badly needed criticism. I also welcome Parliament’s proposal that the Ombudsman should carry out a study of the practical impact of critical remarks that were made, inter alia, in relation to the Commission. Certainly, Parliament is often touchingly united in criticising other institutions, but there is actually good reason for Parliament also to be self-critical. The Ombudsman has recently asked Parliament to disclose information on payments received by MEPs for travel and for employing staff, but Parliament has refused to disclose the information, taking the view that it is a breach of data protection. I believe that this is merely putting up a smokescreen, and I have the support of the European Data Protection Supervisor when I say this. Payments to staff are obviously public documents. It is time for Parliament to come clean on payments. Only those who employ staff on slave-type contracts and other strange contracts have something to fear from more transparency. It surely cannot be the case that any Members here are afraid of not being re-elected in 2009 if it emerges in the media how employees are treated in certain cases, I say in certain cases. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should, of course, like to mention that we are examining the 10th report by the Ombudsman, who in 2006 received 3 889 letters or e-mails of complaint, 3 619 of which were sent by individual members of the public.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of the 3 889 complaints, 3 051 were outside the mandate. In other words, there were, in a single year, a total of 838 complaints within the mandate. I therefore think that the Ombudsman’s department is large enough in terms of staff and resources to handle 838 complaints, which, of course, mainly concern matters of maladministration by the Commission and the European Personnel Selection Office, and to a lesser degree the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is of course commendable that the Ombudsman publishes a list of best administrative practices. I do not know, however, whether his department allows citizens to make complaints about the operation of his own department. I regret that the report by the Committee on Petitions refers us only to the European Personnel Selection Office, and not to the European Ombudsman, who until now has not carried out an ex officio scrutiny of his department.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are therefore requesting not a change in the Ombudsman’s Statute, but rather a strengthening of the rights that we already accord him. This should allow him to show due respect for citizens, be very active in the correct administration of European institutions, and respect the personal data of citizens, Members of the European Parliament, and employees who are required to maintain secrecy. The European Court of Justice should operate independently, without the Ombudsman’s intervention, and there should be respect for the effective international agencies that operate independently to protect fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our support for the European Ombudsman is not without limits.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and Ms Sbarbati for their excellent work on the Ombudsman’s report. It is important that this debate is taking place at a prime time in Parliament’s plenary working day, at a time when it can have a high public profile.</p>
      <p sl="en">The service that the Ombudsman provides is extremely important for the citizen: it enhances the positive connection between Europe’s institutions and the citizen and enriches the legitimacy of the work we do in the institutions, whether it is in Parliament, the Commission or the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The service continues to evolve and that is pointed up quite well in Ms Sbarbati’s report, where she makes various suggestions, and the Ombudsman himself makes various suggestions, as to how it could continue to improve. Certainly, the idea of broadening relations with mediators who deal with issues regarding minors and children is an important development.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, there is resistance in the system: resistance to transparency, resistance to a common code of administrative practice for all the institutions and resistance, as well, to updating the mandate of the Ombudsman. I believe the European Parliament should take a more active role, for instance, in dealing with the transparency issue, and I support the Ombudsman’s call for Parliament to be more transparent in the publication of allowances paid to Members.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the activities of the European Ombudsman give EU citizens the feeling that they have some protection against inappropriate actions taken by EU institutions. The material presented raises some issues. The first of these is that the largest number of complaints submitted to the Ombudsman relates to the European Commission, the European Personnel Selection Office and the European Parliament. The failure of European institutions, with the exception of the Ombudsman, to implement the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in accordance with the 2001 Resolution of the European Parliament may be a contributory factor. The second issue is that 78.5% of the matters submitted to the Ombudsman fall outside his competence, and 93.7% of these complaints do not relate to EU bodies or institutions. This would indicate that our citizens do not have sufficient information about the work of the Ombudsman or that, for various reasons, they are unable to get important issues dealt with in their own countries. This matter needs to be investigated. The third issue is that the Ombudsman should have the powers that are necessary quickly to remove bad administrative practices that give rise to complaints.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to welcome our visitors, the citizens, to this debate. I hope that they understand what the Ombudsman is about, following his very detailed presentation of twelve months’ work in a very short space of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a pity that the Ombudsman receives so many cases that it is not within his competence to resolve, but I understand that these are redirected to the appropriate places. It is important to say that to people listening to this debate. Those cases do not fall by the wayside, but are sent in the right direction. That you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive, but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it, in order to bring even more cases to your desk. That would do no harm, because I am sure the small number you deal with does not truly reflect the problems of maladministration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the Commission, I quite like the idea of a culture of service, but I am not sure that the Commission uses the carrot and stick approach internally to make sure that there is indeed a culture of service. This is something that should be done through legislation. Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens? Perhaps that is something we could have a closer look at.</p>
      <p sl="en">I like the idea of putting forward the star performers and the worst performers so that we can have that comparison, but at the end of the day what people want is results and positive outcomes. I keep saying to people in Ireland that the Committee on Petitions does not have huge power, but that through the work we do we can act as a pressure point for action. I wish we had more power, but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens. They are not interested in the process. They just want positive outcomes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Diamandouros, I wish you well in your activities this year and hope you continue in the same way as in the past. I will certainly work in Ireland to make sure that we know a lot more about you in the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like first to thank Mr Diamandouros for his report and to acknowledge the enormous amount of work being done by Commissioner Wallström, and to congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her pertinent report which will act as our guide to assessing the improvements we anticipate for 2007 and 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">We welcome the content of the current report, which shows that the task of the European Ombudsman has become established and has bedded in; it also shows increased contact with authorities and with citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Personally, I particularly welcome the agreement with the current Government of Spain on the use of co-official languages – Basque, Catalan and Gallego, as this will bring the citizens of Spain closer to their rights without diminishing the functionality of Spanish, which will prove very useful in future contacts with third country nationals.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are, however, other aspects noted by Mr Diamandouros himself, which are a source of concern: more than 75% of complaints are not about European competences but national or regional competences. We therefore take the view that it is a matter of great urgency to strengthen the communication strategy of the European Network of Ombudsmen so that this can be put right.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another problem highlighted is the fall in instances of maladministration concluded by friendly agreement or consensus. We supporters of the Ombudsman urge him to improve his know-how and recover his effectiveness in this route. Persuasion is better than force.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally I shall only add that it would be ironic if the legitimate ambition of the current Ombudsman to apply the Code of Administrative Conduct led him to be more diligent outside his home than within it.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Thank you, Madam President. The office of Ombudsman is today well established and I would like to congratulate it on its good work. We now need to look ahead to ensure that the tools that citizens have at their disposal for seeking redress are clear, known to all and function more efficiently. At present there is too much confusion regarding where citizens should go when they want to make a complaint. Some appeal to the Committee on Petitions, some to the Commission, some to the Ombudsman, and some appeal to everyone, which results in a great deal of confusion, duplicated work and unnecessary expenses that could all be avoided. There is therefore a need, as Commissioner Wallström rightly said, for better coordination between the institutions that hear and make decisions on complaints. For example, there should be a clear commitment regarding the time within which these agencies must reply to citizens once they receive their complaints, and also a commitment regarding the maximum length of time they can take to give a definitive reply. We still hear all too often about complaints that were lodged years before and are still pending. As my colleague Ms McGuinness has stated, when a complaint is sent to the wrong agency, that agency should not send a negative reply but should itself pass the complaint on to the correct agency. Finally, when a citizen formulates his complaint in an unclear manner, because, after all, not all citizens are lawyers, a greater effort should be made to ensure that whoever receives the complaint gives the complainant the benefit of the doubt and does not automatically consider the complaint inadmissible. I think we have taken huge steps forward and once again I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman, but we still have a lot more to do. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to express my satisfaction that the European Ombudsman fulfils his functions in a balanced and dynamic manner, both in the consideration of complaints, which numbered 3830 in 2006, and in running and completing investigations. Also encouraging are the good relations between the Ombudsman and EU bodies and institutions, as well as the encouragement given to citizens to exercise their rights. As we are debating this report, I would like to emphasise how important it is to make sure that there are the necessary budget and staffing resources to ensure that citizens receive rapid and objective responses to their questions, complaints and petitions. It is obvious that all institutions should work in a constructive manner with the Ombudsman at every stage of the procedure, and the Ombudsman should present Parliament with suggestions that, in his view, would help to improve procedures and make this cooperation even more effective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In congratulating Professor Diamandouros on his achievements as Ombudsman, I would at the same time like to encourage him to continue his efforts and to promote his activities even more, so that, in the eyes of European citizens, he becomes a guarantor of good administration in EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Ten years after the institution of the European Ombudsman was established, I am pleased to find the evolution of its role and activities in the process of protecting the European citizen.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 2006 activity report proves to us that, nowadays, European citizens benefit from a true competent court where they can defend themselves against any institution and, in fact, prevent and signal their defective operation. In other words, we speak today about a true instrument of democratic control, performed in an autonomous and transparent manner, which can only be beneficial to the European Union. Moreover, I am grateful to the European Parliament’s Rapporteur for pointing out the aspects to be improved in the Ombudsman’s current activity as well. First of all, I regret the fact that there are still many complaints from citizens who have not obtained the information requested in their own language. This proves to us that, in Europe, we still have problems in ensuring full linguistic rights and equality among citizens. We are on the brink of the year 2008, declared the year of intercultural dialogue, and are forced to immediately correct these deficiencies, which are contrary to the European Union’s fundamental values.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In my turn, I welcome the European Ombudsman’s communication strategy and I emphasize the need to consolidate it.

      <p sl="pl">The European Ombudsman is one of the principal bodies in the democratic life of the European Union. He should guard the democratic equality of all European citizens and act as a mediator between citizens and the Community’s organs of public administration, which, for various reasons, do not comply with the standards that have been set. It is encouraging to see the information presented in the report on the Ombudsman’s activities in 2006, showing his dynamic involvement in the public life of the Community and his active cooperation with both EU citizens and the administrative bodies of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To improve the effectiveness of the Ombudsman’s activities it would be worth considering the possibility of preparing lists of best administrative practice, with exemplary or exceptional cases in which the Ombudsman was involved in any given year, as well as a list of the cases where the actions of institutions were less appropriate. In addition, in order to ensure that the Ombudsman is fully and decisively involved, support should be given to the idea that the Ombudsman should also carry out investigations in the so-called third pillar, that is, Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters, which would also extend to the activities of Europol.</p>

I also wish to thank the very large number of Members who, in fact, took the time to comment on my report. I am deeply grateful for the interest that this expresses and the guidance that it contains.</p>
      <p sl="el">With respect to Ms Sbarbati, let me just say that I of course worked very closely and intend to continue to work very closely with the Petitions Committee, with which I have excellent relations. The Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman will continue to be the major instrument through which this august body will also be able to deal with citizens’ approaches to the European institutions. I take note of your remarks. I can tell you that I have already launched an own-initiative inquiry concerning EPSO, as you know, but I want to announce it to this body. I also have taken a strong interest and continue to monitor very carefully developments in the European schools.</p>
      <p sl="el">I wish to thank Ms Wallström for her remarks. I note that she has recorded the increase in the number of cases where the Commission apologises for instances in which its services have not abided by best practice. I am very grateful to her for acknowledging that. I will be meeting with Ms Wallström in the near future, and I will also be meeting with the Directors-General of the Commission and the coordinators of all the services dealing with the Ombudsman, precisely in order to be able to bring about better coordination and better results. This is an indication of how closely I am working with the Commission, and I hope to be able to elicit better results to report to you next year, and of course to report to citizens. That includes the infringement, and I will be dealing with that as well.</p>
      <p sl="el">On a more general point, let me just say that I am very grateful to you for your general support on broad issues like the culture of service, which is very central to my concerns; for your references to the need for more resources for the Ombudsman; for your support on the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Statute; and for your call for greater accountability, which for me of course is extraordinarily important. I can also let you know that I have launched, as of this year, a concerted effort to reach out to business associations as opposed to individuals, with an eye to better informing them of their rights as well.</p>
      <p sl="el">Because of the pressure of time, allow me not to switch languages, but first of all to say to Ms McGuinness and also to Ms Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, that I manage to help 70% of the 70% that are outside my mandate. Therefore, my work involves not only the percentage that is within my mandate, but on top of that there is a great deal of effort being expended by my staff to be able to help every single citizen who comes to us whose concern is outside the mandate, by referring to the appropriate institution, be it at European or national level. Therefore, this covers 3 830 cases, not 885.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me now to switch languages.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mrs Panayiotopoulos, I want to assure you that the European Ombudsman is fully aware of his obligation to work within the legal limits. He will, of course, always work according to the basic principle of accountability to Parliament and to you, and at all times he will be acutely aware of his responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, I am doing all I can to promote the creation of a national ombudsman in Italy. I have been there four or five times and I will continue to do so, hoping that we will be able to welcome an Italian national ombudsman into our midst in the near future.</p>

I can tell you that, very early on, the Ombudsman kept us informed about the work on the new Statute, and we have been in constant touch about this. Of course, there are some things we could easily approve, but others are more complicated. The Commission will formally give its opinion only after Parliament makes its proposals. We have also met with Ms Jäätteenmäki, and we are looking forward to her report with interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other direct question was from Ms McGuinness about the carrot-and-stick approach and whether we applied it. No, not enough, I would say – or not yet. But what we have been doing over the last period of time is to create more of a visibility of these issues and also create an ownership within the Commission for every directorate-general and through all the hierarchical levels in the Commission. I think that creating that sense of responsibility and visibility will help us to encourage and also sometimes to make it known when we are not pleased with how individual officials are dealing with cases. I think it is rather rarely the case of an individual official making a mistake; it is more about the culture. This is what we have in the walls, and this is what we have to change now. I think the reforms we have taken will move us in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just finally mention one thing that I hope will be welcomed by the Commission as well as the European Parliament: we are working with citizens’ summaries on our proposals. Again, to come closer to citizens, we also have to express ourselves not in EU jargon but in plain language, and I hope this will help.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mrs Sbarbati’s report on the European Ombudsman’s activities is evidence of her regard for this institution, which was set up under the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to defend European citizens in the event of maladministration by Community institutions. The report rightly emphasises certain priorities for the Ombudsman in the future: the importance of cooperating with ombudsmen in the Member States, for example, and the proposal for better internal supervision of how EU bodies are managed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It also raises two questions, however, which we omit from the European debate at our peril. On the one hand, the Ombudsman’s activities must entail a review of the institution’s profile and accessibility throughout Europe. There is, in fact, a downward trend in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman (3 830 in 2006, a decrease of 2% from 2005), and complaints tend to come from Member States that already have a culture of encouraging people to raise issues with the relevant national institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, the report considers the question of extending the Ombudsman’s powers (with regard to accessing documents and the unconditional hearing of witnesses). No amendment to the Statute of the Ombudsman must be allowed to obscure the major role played by Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, which draws its legitimacy directly from the ballot box.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has taken a unanimous decision, which I am relaying to you, addressing myself in particular to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the context of its deliberations on the Commission’s proposal for the amendment of the Regulation on the funding of European political parties, the Committee of Permanent Representatives decided yesterday to split the Commission’s proposal in two and to adopt the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulation in a separate legislative instrument, to be created on the legal basis that applies to amendments to the Financial Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This would mean that key elements of this legislative process would be taken out of the sphere of parliamentary codecision and that the Commission, contrary to its own convictions, would have to present a new proposal, while it would also be essential, or at least advisable, to consult the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament calls on the Council to reconsider its decision. The amendments to the Political Parties Regulation proposed by the Commission are necessary to overcome practical difficulties that have arisen in its application. They would also make it possible to continue supporting the development at the European level of political foundations, which play an important part in opening political processes to public scrutiny. For these reasons, it is imperative that the proposed regulation should enter into force very soon.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 22 October, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a report expressing willingness to compromise with the Council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The splitting of this instrument by the Permanent Representatives has thwarted these efforts. It is legally unnecessary, undermines the Commission’s right of initiative, curtails the rights of Parliament, and is likely to cause significant delays.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On behalf of the Conference of Presidents I call on the Council to overturn at ministerial level the decision of the Permanent Representatives.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I have been asked for leave to speak, but there will be no debate thereafter.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am extremely grateful to you for this statement, Mr President, and also to the Conference of Presidents. It is a serious matter when the European Parliament – the chamber of the people at the European level – is excluded from the legislative process relating to a regulation on European political parties. That is truly a subject that concerns all of us here, whatever our party affiliation. It is unthinkable that the bureaucracies in some finance ministries and then their governments should decide on this issue rather than the people’s representative assembly of the EU. We should not stand for that! With regard to the budget for 2008, let me say that the national governments have wishes which they can only fulfil together with us. When dealing with the 2008 budget, this Parliament should remember what the Council decided yesterday with regard to this Regulation on the European political parties. Thank you for your statement. We have not seen the end of this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as this House will have understood from what you said, Coreper decided to split the Commission’s proposal into two legal instruments: one regulation under Article 199, to which codecision applies, to cover political foundations and campaigning, and another regulation under Article 279, which means simple consultation of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to cover the financial derogations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission opposed that splitting of its proposal for sound legal reasons, but also for political reasons. The decision introduces uncertainty as regards timing, when we want the proposal to enter into force before the end of this year so that the foundations can be fully functional before 2009. That was the whole idea behind the proposal. We also think that the whole proposal should be approved by codecision, under Article 199 of the Treaty. We regret, therefore, that Coreper decided, against the Commission’s will, to reduce Parliament’s role in an issue intimately related to Parliament’s business, namely the financing of the political parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just 36 hours after the Committee on Constitutional Affairs approved by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal, Coreper decided to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our destination, I hope, remains the same: approval of the substance of our proposal before the end of this year.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I have another announcement to make before we move on to the budget. At its meeting this morning – Thursday, 25 October – the Conference of Presidents unanimously chose the winner of the Sakharov Prize. For his commitment to the all-too-long-forgotten victims in Darfur, the Conference decided that the prize would be awarded to Salih Mahmoud Osman.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">For more than 20 years, Mr Osman, a human-rights lawyer and member of the Sudanese Organisation against Torture, has been defending countless victims of the conflict in Darfur who have been arbitrarily imprisoned, driven from their homes and tortured or who face the death penalty. His seat in the Sudanese Parliament now enables him to bring their cause to the attention of the international community, though sometimes at great personal sacrifice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Osman champions the cause of dialogue and justice against violence and tyranny. Without democracy there can be no justice. By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman, the European Parliament would like to support the work of this courageous man who has become the voice of Darfur and, through him, to support the establishment of the rule of law in Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The formal presentation of the prize will take place in Strasbourg on Tuesday, 11 December.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In addition, I should like to inform you that the Conference of Presidents was also unanimous in its view that we should consider an appropriate way to honour the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, and …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before the beginning of the vote, I want to make the following statement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Committee on Budgets voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2008 draft budget. Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request to be put to the vote in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments:</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only;</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938;</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations;</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">These technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Frontex, a technical error was identified subsequent to the vote in committee concerning the remarks. The correct modification to the remarks is contained in Amendment 1133, which is annexed to the voting list.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02. And, on budget line 09 03 03, the right figure for commitment appropriations should be 5 and payment appropriations 4.85.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators’ meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02 (multimedia actions), but taking the reserve from Amendment 752, and rejecting Amendment 1044 and voting in favour of Amendment 32 on line 16 02 03.</p>

      <p sl="en">This means new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex. Today there is also too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on the environment and social projects. However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes to existing means. We did choose to support the specific amendment 945, since it covers, among other things, aid to Palestine, even though there were other aspects of the amendment of which we do not approve.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. Of course no budget is perfect, but we must nevertheless strive to spend common funds in a just and future-oriented manner. Unfortunately, most of the European Union budget continues to be spent on preserving the conditions of the past. This is why it is important to ensure that some money goes towards the future, towards research, development and science. The financing of the European Institute of Technology still needs to be resolved, because the Commission has proposed a bridging solution of a maximum amount of EUR 308 million. Budapest would be an ideal location for the European Institute of Technology, owing to its excellent research results and the scientific expertise it has gathered in combating climate change. This is another reason why I am keen to see a resolution to the issue of financing. We Hungarians are able to provide an appropriate location for an Institute that is modest in size, economical, but all the more rigorous in terms of its intellectual basis.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately the European Parliament is opting in too many cases today to spend more money. That is why I have a problem with paragraphs 2 and 4 in the Virrankoski report. That is not appropriate in a European Union that wishes to concentrate on the areas where there is a benefit, the core tasks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, an additional problem that makes it more difficult to approve the Virrankoski report is Amendment 2 by the Socialist Group.

      <p sl="sv">We voted in favour of reducing export subsidies in agriculture, but think that it is unreasonable to vote in favour of a complete and immediate withdrawal of aid.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At the same time as restrictions are imposed on the EU budget, its priorities are defined as competition policy (an example of which is the gradual distortion of structural policy, placing it at the service of the Lisbon Strategy), and the communitisation of ‘internal security and immigration control’ and the EU’s external policy, which promotes intervention and the militarisation of international relations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I support the European Union’s Budget, in its current form, for several reasons. The 553 million euro cut-back in agriculture, operated by the Council, was mainly reestablished, and the reserve created on the Commission’s administrative funds is justified by the delays recorded in approving the Sectorial Operational Programmes and Rural Development Programmes. At the second reading of the European budget, the Council of Ministers should not perform additional reductions in the agriculture funds or structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The amendment submitted in the plenum for limiting the farmers’ income to maximum 50,000 euros per year is unjustified. Such an artificial barrier would prevent the best farmers from developing their work profitably. Moreover, this restriction will contribute to breaking down the agricultural works and to the decline of European agricultural competitiveness. For this reason, I rejected the amendment providing for this measure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 2008 budget, in the form we adopt today, is a budget that makes the European Union institutions accountable. I support the proposal to transfer 49 million euros from the funds allocated to the Commission to reserves until it submits a clear report on its human resources policy, especially as regards the recruitment of new employees from the countries that have recently joined the European Union – Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

Hence the Committee on Budgets’ incomprehensible and unacceptable rejection of our proposal that sought to ensure, for example, that Portuguese should be one of the working languages in EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly meetings, particularly considering the Members of Parliament of various countries represented on the Committee whose official language is Portuguese.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the worrying and growing tendency to reinforce appropriations for a ‘strong information policy’ in the context of the (re)‘launch’ of the ‘reform’ Treaty and the next elections to the EP in 2009. To understand what is really going on, it will suffice to follow the discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the review of the European Political Parties Regulation to understand what is really going on.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The current system of proceedings for the plenary sessions at the headquarters of the Strasbourg Parliament and the committee or group sessions in Brussels is inefficient and uneconomical. It is estimated that over 200 million euros would be saved annually from the European tax payer’s money if it was decided to establish the Parliament’s headquarters in Brussels, not only due to the inherent cost reduction, but also by facilitating interinstitutional work. At the same time, groups from the civil society have drawn attention to the serious environmental consequences of the frequent transportation of the European Members of Parliament and civil servants from city to city for the proceedings of the European legislative activity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For these reasons, I consider that the idea to maintain two annual plenary sessions at the Strasbourg headquarters is unjustified.

      <p sl="fr">If ever there was a sensitive subject, it is surely the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters. The fact is that criminal law in Europe today is not standard – indeed far from it. Different countries have not only different legal traditions and values but also different criminal laws. The Member States’ criminal law systems reflect their respective identities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Examples of disparity in criminal law at national level are many and varied. For example, the protection of freedom of expression and the definition of what constitutes a violation of freedom of expression differ markedly from one country to another. It would therefore be very dangerous to insist that a penalty handed down in one country should automatically be applied in another: dangerous not only for those who come before the law, but also for the rule of law generally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So we need to tread very warily indeed here, because it is currently impossible to ensure the application of certain common basic standards in the law of criminal procedure. I am thinking particularly of respect for the principle of double jeopardy, of the right to a genuine, rather than a merely formal, defence and, indeed, of victims’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two fundamental principles that must always be followed and observed – otherwise the rule of law will cease to exist. They are the principles of legality and legal certainty.</p>

      <p sl="pt">New red tape has subsequently created additional difficulties in the process, however, which has therefore dragged on until this time, involving great cost, something the rapporteur has rightly condemned.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The increased prices for cereals and food benefit farmers and can provide a better opportunity to restructure the agricultural sector in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The recent rise in food prices is due largely to successive reforms in the CAP, the abandonment of production thereby promoted, and the resulting disappearance of many small and medium-sized farms. Ignoring the specific reality of Member States to take greater account of the interests of the large agri-industrial enterprises, multinational food distributors and negotiations to liberalise trade within the WTO has helped to change the basis of agricultural activity, leading to a fall in output.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Meanwhile, the use of agricultural products for non-food purposes, particularly for producing biofuels, which they seek to prioritise, will not help to develop agricultural activity and may, on the contrary, replace the production of food products, thereby having a negative impact on the protection of food sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore believe it is essential to reappraise the objectives of the common agricultural policy in order to increase food product output, support small and medium-sized agricultural and livestock holdings and moderate consumer prices, reinforcing intervention mechanisms and ensuring appropriate intervention prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European private company statute has regularly been on the agenda of the European Parliament and also, as you know, on that of its Committee on Legal Affairs. Various arguments presented during these debates have demonstrated that a statute for European private companies may bring benefits to small and medium-sized companies, and there has also been support for the idea of a stakeholder consultation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission recognises that the regulatory framework needs to be adapted to allow SMEs to make the most of increasingly integrated European markets. We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business. It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The growth of small and medium-sized businesses is crucial, as we all know, for the competitiveness of the European economy, and the Commission can see that a European private company statute could facilitate the expansion of small businesses beyond national borders. Therefore, by providing an option, it would create more choice for companies, without imposing any additional burdens.</p>
      <p sl="en">It could well reduce the compliance costs for firms that wish to operate in several Member States. If this can be achieved, SMEs could have easier access to new markets. The Commission is therefore aware of the importance of the European private company statute to the Member States of the European Union and to European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy, will proceed with a legislative proposal for a European private company statute, as he declared to the Legal Affairs Committee on 3 October 2007. This proposal should be ready by mid-2008 at the latest. As you know, we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal, the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year. My colleague Mr McCreevy will be very happy to have a continued dialogue with you once this proposal is on the table.</p>

    <intervention id="4-206" speaker_id="2224" name="Klaus-Heiner Lehne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you sincerely for your remarks, which bring me neatly to my first point, namely the European private-company statute. I may say we are delighted that, after protracted difficulties, the Commission has finally been convinced of the need for this legislative draft, and that we can now expect to receive it. It is to the credit of Parliament that this was made possible by the heavy pressure we exerted. Be that as it may, we can only rejoice wholeheartedly at the outcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do, however, intend to address a second point to which today’s resolution also refers, and on which we are not satisfied with the way things have developed. I refer here to the 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of the company’s registered office, the place where companies are registered. For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law. We have now learned that this has been more or less deleted from the legislative programme, at least as far as the European Commission is concerned, and that the loophole will therefore remain open.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I emphasise at this point that my political group at least – and, I believe, an overwhelming majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, to judge by the tenor of its deliberations in recent years, and of this House as a whole – has always taken the view that this loophole needs to be closed and that the 14th Company Law Directive is a necessity.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not a matter of additional bureaucracy and new corporate obligations. It is simply about giving companies the opportunity promised them in the Treaty to move freely within the European Union and establish themselves in any Member State. We have heard that one of the reasons why the European Commission felt unable to move forward on this issue and to present a proposal was its view that the existing merger regulations and other provisions were adequate to guarantee corporate mobility.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only say that, if a company cannot move its registered office within the single market unless it founds a new company in another country and then merges with it, the present rules are scarcely exemplary as a means of avoiding red tape or minimising costs. The ideal would be a sound piece of secondary legislation that guaranteed the right of companies to exercise in practice the freedom that the single market offers them in theory.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the arguments advanced for the status quo is that past rulings of the European Court of Justice have greatly liberalised company law in any case. That is undoubtedly true, but the European Court delivers these rulings for the sole purpose of promoting the full application of primary law, simply because the legislative bodies responsible for the adoption of secondary law, namely Parliament and the Council – though we depend on the European Commission – are not able to enact sound secondary legislation that would actually guarantee the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty provisions establishing the single market.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why Parliament is adhering to its position that the Commission’s monopoly on the right of initiative binds it to present a proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive in due course. We ask the Commission to reconsider whether the 14th Directive, which is already on file in the Commission’s offices, can be incorporated into the legislative programme in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="de">If that does not happen, Parliament reserves the right – as our resolution expressly states – to invoke Article 192 of the Treaty and table a report on its own initiative with a view to requesting a legislative proposal. And while we are on the subject of company law, let me take this convenient opportunity to say a brief word about the Commission’s latest communication on the simplification of company law. The resolution does not deal directly with that communication, but there is a thematic connection between the two.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we in Parliament agree that we do not support any erosion of the substance of established Community law and practice – the acquis communautaire – as a consequence of simplification measures. In other words, there can be no question, in my view, of deleting entire directives. What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies, to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations, to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant. I believe there is scope here to cooperate closely with the Commission in order to improve company law.</p>
      <p sl="de">One other thing that struck me when I read the Commission’s documentation on this subject was that there are certain laws we have enacted – one example being the Transparency Directive, adopted in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act – which contain some provisions that now beg the question of why they are not being reviewed as part of a simplification drive. I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission, since such a review would likewise help to improve company law.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Lehne has in essence given the view held by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs. He has done so on behalf of the European People’s Party Group, and I shall do so on behalf of the Party of European Socialists.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our concern at present is, as Mr Lehne has said, that we are relying too heavily on judicial development of the law, in other words, on development through the case-law of the Court of Justice. The case-law of the Court of Justice fills in the gaps left by the secondary law of the European Union, but we do not have secondary law. The Treaties are very general in nature and provide for certain fields and give rise to various interpretations and do not at present facilitate the establishment of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our proposals are bi-directional, as Mr Lehne has pointed out, firstly they support the offer made by the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the European private company which would clearly do a great deal to help establish free movement within the European Union, and secondly to try to continue pushing in the field of company law by pressing for a new directive, the fourteenth, which could ultimately supplement those provisions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I share Mr Lehne’s concern that, if we do not adopt provisions on the transfer of company head offices, then we would in fact be leaving a legal loophole open because mergers are a different matter and do not fall fully into this category. We hope the Commission can include this type of activities in its work programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, I hope that during 2008 and, if possible, before 30 June, the proposal for a directive, the Directive on the European private company statute, will be on the table, and, secondly, it is to be hoped that the Commission does not give up on the idea of continuing to develop company law in fields such as freedom of establishment and change of domicile for companies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me answer both questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In answer to the first, I think it is clear. In answer to the second, concerning the 14th company law directive, we had suggested that a further means of improving mobility might be a directive stipulating the conditions for the transfer of registered offices in the European Union. The results of the economic analysis of the possible added value of a directive were inconclusive; companies already have the legal means to effect cross-border transfer. Several companies have already transferred their registered office using the possibilities offered by the European Company Statute.</p>
      <p sl="en">Soon, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive, which will enter into force in December, will give all limited liability companies, including SMEs, the option to transfer their registered office. They could do so by setting up a subsidiary in the Member State to which they want to move and then merging the existing company into this subsidiary.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission’s view, it is only if this framework is found wanting that future legislative action in the shape of a 14th company law directive can be justified. Therefore, Mr McCreevy has decided for the moment not to proceed with this 14th company law directive, but I will certainly communicate your concerns again.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, once again we are talking about Iran. I am the co-author of a resolution prepared by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. The situation in Iran is a never-ending story of breaches of human rights. The European Parliament returns to this issue very regularly, giving the names of more victims and more examples of breaches of human rights. I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business. In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper. It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country. The attention of the world’s public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran. Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is not the first time, and I fear that it will not be the last, that this House is called upon to deal with the situation in Iran. That country, which has all the natural resources for achieving an envious standard of living for its people, is unfortunately sinking deeper into the abyss of dark ages-like totalitarian governance, with the resulting gross violations of the human rights of its citizens, and with Iran becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The continued practice of barbaric acts such as the stoning to death of citizens, including women and children, and the non-recognition of the quality of the rights of women and of political opponents, is a stigma to civilised living. Every day, reports reach us of even more cases of arrests, torture and killings of innocent civilians by the authorities of Iran.</p>

      <a text="(Applause from certain quarters)"/>
      <p sl="en">Thank you, Mr Tannock.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is pretty much non-existent in that country, and all this at the same time as the secretive work to produce nuclear weapons is going ahead against all common sense and in spite of international outcry.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Iranian regime, blinded by short-sighted nationalism and extreme religious fanaticism, is following a road that can only lead to confrontation and consequent suffering, mainly to its own people. Let us once again, on the occasion of voting for this resolution, send a message of support to those Iranians fighting for freedom and democracy, and let us again make clear to the extremist rulers of Iran that our patience is running out fast owing to their foolishly dangerous behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week we had the pleasure of hearing the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Doris Lessing, who as we know is of Iranian descent, saying what we all think: ‘I hate the Iranian government. It’s a cruel and evil government’. Doris Lessing also said that the reason nobody dares to criticise the Iranian government is because of oil. I think she could not have been more accurate and could not have put it better.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This policy of appeasement is lethal, not only for the interests of the Iranian people, but also for everyone who wants peace. The continuation of this policy and the fuelling of the Iranian regime’s expansionist and fanatical instincts will be the greatest tragedy we will face in the near future. I believe we must all be aware of that fact and must reverse this policy. If we do not, the future will be very bleak, and I would just like to say, Mr President, that this House should send a very special greeting to the Nobel Prize winner for her very judicious words.</p>

    <intervention id="4-216" speaker_id="4508" name="Erik Meijer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered. Firstly, the appalling human rights situation that has developed as a result of a regime based not on democracy and human equality, but on its own interpretation of the will of God, which gives it the right to imprison, torture and murder others.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the attempt by the regime to win mass support, despite its role as a violent minority. It is artificially attempting to appeal to national pride. The reason for that pride is the possession of nuclear energy and possibly even nuclear weapons, just like India, Pakistan and Israel, which have not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, opposition to the regime. Both the moderate opposition, which wants a slightly less strict system, as was the case under the previous president, and the real democratic opposition amongst workers and students in Iran, and also amongst intellectuals who have fled abroad.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourthly, the American threat to use the same model in Iran as in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a military invasion or at least bombing. Such an attack by foreign opponents would be counter-productive. That would encourage patriotic feeling on the part of the Iranians, and they would rally to the support of the hated regime and its nuclear weapons, if any.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My group is not in favour of a military invasion against the regime, or of seeking friendship with that regime out of self-interest. We should show solidarity with the victims and the opposition. The regime must not in any way be given the impression that it is possible to negotiate restrictions on the rights of the opposition in exile in Europe, and must not be allowed to spread propaganda by claiming that democratic countries support its misrule.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Court of Justice’s decision to remove the People’s Mujahidin organisation from the list of terrorist organisations should be fully complied with, so that that organisation and other opposition groups do not face any legal or financial obstacles.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe there are three elements – at least three – justifying this urgency.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, as has already been noted, the growing deterioration in the human rights situation. Secondly, the record figures for executions, not only in numerical terms but also in the brutality with which they are being carried out. Today we have more executions than there were in the whole of 2007 – 244 in 2007 and 177 in 2006. The third element is the persecution to which organisations for human rights activists are being subjected, especially those organisations which defend women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that all this justifies not only this resolution but also, as the resolution states, urging the United Nations General Assembly to vote on a resolution explicitly and unreservedly condemning the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. This is something we have been asking for for a long time. We do not understand why there is this reticence about it and I hope that this resolution will at least help to change some minds.</p>

    <intervention id="4-218" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims, is considered by outstanding specialists to be a book of love. But what is happening in those countries that call themselves Islamic countries? They are governed by extreme radicals. The only message that comes out of these countries is one of hatred of the outside world, of fellow Muslims and of their own citizens. What is happening in present-day Iran is absolutely unacceptable. On many occasions we have already talked in this Chamber of the need to apply radical measures in order to prevent various types of breaches of human rights in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is particularly horrifying is the way that the death penalty is carried out. Carrying out the death penalty by stoning is uncivilised, inhumane, and completely unacceptable to any democracy. Carrying out the death penalty on minors, which is prohibited in the whole of the democratic and civilised world, continues in Iran, despite the promises of the Iranian government and parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Further acts of hatred are aimed at any opposition – both the very small internal opposition from individual citizens, and the much larger and more organised opposition both within the country and from beyond its borders. Arrests of journalists, lack of freedom of speech, bans on printing or even speaking under threat of imprisonment or even death, this is a situation that we cannot in any way accept. Today, any appeals seem almost to be too late. We should think about more specific restrictions that would force the Iranian government to change its behaviour.</p>

    <intervention id="4-219" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Benita Ferrero-Waldner" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, we in the Commission welcome this new joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you that we have all repeatedly expressed our great concerns about the human rights situation in Iran – I, myself, very recently during the UN General Assembly, on the margins of which I met the Iranian Foreign Minister, where, again, I very strongly emphasised all the facts that are there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must say that the respect for basic human rights in Iran has continued to deteriorate seriously over the past year and, for this reason, we will also support the new UN General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, as we do each year, which Canada is likely to table.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a continuous clampdown on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and political dissent. There have been new cases of torture and executions of people who were minors at the time of the alleged crime. There has also been an increasing number of public executions, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, including in one case through stoning, despite assurances by the Iranian side that stoning was forbidden under existing decrees. I also very specifically mentioned this case when I met the Iranian Foreign Minister. Iran has carried out at least 250 executions so far this year – the second highest number of executions worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also note, of course, the continuous discrimination against minorities, increasing harassment and the closure of independent non-governmental organisations. The documented intimidation and persecution of human rights defenders from all sectors of Iranian society has grown, as has the repression of intellectuals, teachers, students, women activists and trade unions. Only recently, one of Iran’s best-known human rights defenders, Mr Emaddedin Baghi, was once again imprisoned under the charge of propaganda against the Government. And, since July, Mr Mansour Osanlou, President of the Iranian Bus Drivers’ Union and the embodiment of an independent trade union movement in Iran, has been under arrest. Mr Osanlou is in need of urgent medical treatment, which, we have reason to believe, he has still not received.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we are not remaining silent about such developments. We have taken numerous steps and repeatedly issued public statements denouncing the ongoing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran, as well as the country’s persistent failure to uphold international standards on the administration of justice. Once more, I call upon the Iranian Government to fully respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with Iran’s obligations under international law and the conventions it has ratified.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to reiterate our concern about Iran’s refusal to resume the bilateral dialogue on human rights it suspended in 2004, which the European Union continues to ask for. For our part, we remain ready to do so, as we believe in the importance of such a dialogue and engagement.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the Commission is, speaking quite unequivocally, in full agreement with Parliament, whatever the developments on the nuclear issue or on other issues of concern to the European Union. And we have this double-track approach, which, at this moment, Javier Solana and his new counterpart are working on, and, at the same time, we are also working in the United Nations Security Council with regard to maybe a further strengthening of sanctions. At this moment, there can be no real progress in the relationship with Iran without a serious improvement in the human rights situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start by expressing my sympathy to the victims of the horrific bomb attack in Karachi. Our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by that dramatic action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pakistan is a nation which we in Europe should care deeply about. It is a great trading nation, it is an exporter of people, not least to this continent, and it is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism. It is a matter, therefore, of great sadness that, in its 60-year history, Pakistan has failed to become a true democracy; but, on the other hand, we should be encouraged by the fact that it has not become a theocracy or even a permanent military dictatorship. Once again in Pakistan, the window is opening for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We await the outcome of the court ruling on the legality of the President’s election. We call on President Musharraf to accept the outcome if it goes against him, but I also call on people in Pakistan and throughout the world to accept the ruling of the Court if it rules in favour of the President. I think it is the only basis on which we can move forward in the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to the election in January, I hope that the Government will pursue and continue to prepare for that election, and will make it possible for Ms Benazir Bhutto to campaign in a secure fashion. In saying that, I know we imply that the Government was behind the bombing; I do not believe that, but we need to make sure that the security of all the candidates is guaranteed and the Government does its best to protect Ms Benazir Bhutto. I also believe that Mr Sharif should be allowed to return to the country and campaign if he so wishes, and again have his security guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The military should stand back during the whole period of the election campaign, and I hope, before January – and, indeed, before campaigning begins – that the President will get himself out of uniform and turn his country into a true civilian government. That is the best hope for the future of Pakistan, and it is the best hope for relations between Europe and Pakistan: that we get a democratically elected parliament in January, with the President out of uniform, in ‘civvies’.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you Mr President. First of all, I must say with a heavy heart that month after month here in Parliament we have to decide on different resolutions because such large parts of the world around us fail to respect civil liberties and rights and violate fundamental human rights. I must say this because I think it is so terrible that it just goes on and on. We talk about it here in Parliament, we talk about it in so many different contexts, and still it goes on.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety. The resolution makes a large number of very justified demands on the government in Pakistan. We in the world around it cannot keep silent about the influence and decision-making power of the military regime in all areas of society. Power must be transferred to a civilian democratic government. We must support all voluntary organisations, everyone working for democratic liberties and rights. I particularly want to stress the importance of paragraph 16 of the resolution. In that point Parliament expresses its great concern at the fact that a large proportion of Pakistani women are not able to participate in the democratic process. People are being oppressed in Pakistan by the military regime on the grounds of religion, but we must not forget the oppression to which a large proportion of Pakistani women are exposed. Our Group wishes strongly to support the entire resolution. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I also wish to say that despite the fact that logically the main responsibility for resolving the situation lies with the Pakistani authorities, that should not allow us forget that the European Union has, and we member countries above all, we Member States, have an enormous responsibility at least not to aggravate the situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is related to the practice, which is also incomprehensible because of its incompatibility with the will to resolve the situation, of continuing to export or seeking to export arms to Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="es">To give but three examples: in 2006 the Government of the United Kingdom authorised the export of 15 000 rifles to the region, including Pakistan; France continues to seek to sell Pakistan missiles and radars to build a combat aircraft which Pakistan is allegedly developing with China; and Germany has also been responsible for exporting significant quantities of munitions, arms and other types of military equipment.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that to that end the desire to resolve the situation in Pakistan is incompatible with supplying it under those policies. I therefore suggest and ask my colleagues to support the amendment seeking the suspension of all types of exports of arms and military equipment until such time as it can be guaranteed that they will not be used to violate human rights.</p>

    <intervention id="4-226" speaker_id="4521" name="Charles Tannock" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, last week’s suicide bomb blast in Karachi reminded us of just how perilously close Pakistan has come to anarchy. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan becoming a rogue state controlled by Islamist fanatics is, quite frankly, terrifying.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not especially a fan of Benazir Bhutto, whose period in office as Prime Minister was marked by widespread corruption, but, ultimately, a democratic and secular-leaning government under civilian control is always preferable to a military dictatorship, compromised in this case by its links to Islamist parties and the Afghan Taliban. President Musharraf is supposed to be our ally in the war on terror; sometimes I wonder how committed he is to rooting out terrorism in his own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hopefully, Ms Bhutto’s return to Pakistan may be a fillip for human rights now. One major concern is the ongoing repression of religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Ahmadi Muslims. If she is to be taken seriously as a progressive leader of a more modern Pakistan, she must make sure that Pakistan respects its international obligations under human rights conventions.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, while Pakistan faces many challenges, we should recognise that some progress is being made in some areas. The economy continues to grow, and Pakistan has also engaged in confidence-building measures with India with regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="en">One question which remains totally unanswered is how, legally, the Pakistani Government, in spite of a Supreme Court judgment permitting former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return from exile to Pakistan, deported him immediately to Saudi Arabia. How, in international law, can a government deport one of its own citizens? Nawaz Sharif may yet have a vital role to play in re-establishing multiparty civilian democratic politics in Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we must take a very discerning view of Pakistan. It is a large and important country with a troubled history. The State of Pakistan was artificially created as a home for the Muslim inhabitants of India, and it therefore has an Islamic identity, which is something we cannot now hold against it. That was more or less its original raison d’être.</p>
      <p sl="de">This does not mean that we should not battle against Islamic extremism, and indeed the Pakistanis themselves are devoting considerable efforts to that very struggle. Pakistan was an important ally in the face of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, in dealings with Communist China, and in the context of long-running Soviet attempts to gain influence in India. It was an important strategic factor for the West.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, it goes without saying that Pakistan has internal difficulties, of which we must be aware: a complex and heterogeneous population structure in ethnic and religious terms, widespread poverty and, of course, the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. We must clearly lend the country a very great deal of support in establishing free elections and a stronger independent judiciary, and must encourage the military command to hand over power gradually to elected politicians. Above all, as Charles Tannock said, we must encourage Pakistan to keep pursuing the confidence-building process with neighbouring India.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect there have been encouraging signs, and the purpose of a balanced policy on Pakistan is to reinforce those signs while expressing any necessary criticism.</p>

    <intervention id="4-228" speaker_id="4529" name="Sarah Ludford" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Pakistani people do not deserve military dictatorship, violence and lawlessness. Therefore, one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Pakistan, who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent, accountable rule, and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is, of course, why we put the stress on the need for a return to democracy and civilian government with free and fair elections in January as being the only way to answer the challenges of Pakistani society.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we also stress the need to remove the militarisation of Pakistani society and deplore the failure of President Musharraf to stand down as army chief, as he promised he would. The rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan. There have been some encouraging developments at times, but these are also accompanied by some very repressive judgments. This falls particularly hard on minorities, religious and otherwise, as well as on women. We rightly call for improvement in that area.</p>
      <p sl="de">This as well, of course, as deploring the suicide bombing and the 140 victims and 500 injured last week. I fear that these could become a pretext for restricting political activity, because already there has been an announcement by the Government that political parties will only be allowed to hold meetings in well-secured parks and public grounds rather than organise processions. One could see how that might be made a pretext.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, one of the more close-to-home reasons for my wanting Pakistan to fight both extremism and militarisation, and to return to the rule of law, is the impact on British people of Pakistani origin, with the calls, for instance, for profiling or for visa requirements for the United States. It would remove that threat to people like my constituents if Pakistan were to be a democratic society.</p>

Why do we spend time on this, especially as we are acting on behalf of European taxpayers? We should remember that the European Union sends significant amounts of money to Pakistan for health care, for the eradication of poverty and for education. For this reason we have a right to be interested in what is happening in that country, which is, in part, supported by money from our electors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw your attention to issues that have not been discussed here. First of all to the fact that religious minorities are persecuted and discriminated against in Pakistan. This applies to Christians, but also to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists. I believe that it is worth focusing on this issue. It is something that disappears from view in the light of these attacks and tragic deaths, but it is a constant feature.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to point out, and this issue has already been raised, that there is discrimination against women. There are special hudud decrees for this purpose.

Pakistan is also, however, a strict Islamic state in which there is no place for people of other faiths or religious minorities and, as has been said, the country has nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Perhaps – but perhaps this cannot be said – Islamabad is in fact a greater threat than Teheran. I do not know. I also have a slight feeling of déjà vu with Pakistan, because just as in other Islamic countries, for instance Algeria at the time, military dictatorships or regimes where the army plays a dominant role prevent Islamic fundamentalists from taking power. Unfortunately, more democracy often means more Islamic fundamentalism and, paradoxically, less democracy. This is a dilemma that we cannot solve just like that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Pakistan prepares for important parliamentary elections, the situation is, as we all know, very difficult and preoccupying, and I, also, like many of you, have to express that I was deeply shocked by the heinous bomb attack and assassination attempt in Karachi, when Ms Benazir Bhutto returned to the country last week, and also by the terrible loss of life, which has affected so many innocent people. We would like to extend our full sympathy to the families of the victims, and we also appeal to the Pakistani authorities to bring those responsible to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">This attack on a peaceful gathering has clearly demonstrated, once again, all the dangers of terrorism and fundamentalism to the people of Pakistan. Ms Bhutto was right in describing this horrible event as a blow against democracy, particularly in the present electoral context of the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s wish to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan is both very relevant and timely. We in Europe should encourage a more open, democratic society and, of course, a strong civil society in Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also of fundamental importance that the elections should then provide maximum democratic legitimacy to the incoming assemblies, and the vote must be democratic, transparent and giving equal opportunities to all the political contestants.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are well aware, it is one of those countries where we might envisage a possible election observation mission. In this context, my services carried out an exploratory mission in June, and they identified, I have to say, important shortcomings in the framework and the conditions for elections, including concerns about the independence of the Election Commission, the completeness and the accuracy of the voter register, restrictive candidature provisions, as well as lack of transparency in the results process.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, with urgent political will, there is still time to improve a number of these problematic areas and, therefore, I have not yet taken a full decision on whether we will deploy a fully-fledged election observation mission. I really have to see the aforementioned elements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the majority of people in Pakistan would like to see a moderate, stable and democratic Pakistan, and we should support them in achieving this aim. We are doing a lot, for instance, on the trade side, in order to help people to get out of poverty, but we also do a lot on the education side, in order not to have pupils and young children being educated in the madrasahs and being educated towards extremism and fundamentalism. But we should also support this because it is of crucial importance, as has been said, for the whole region, including neighbouring countries like important Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we have every reason to stay engaged. This is what we are trying to do and, therefore, this debate is a very timely one.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone for their support in making Pakistan the subject of a written resolution. A show of popularity for democratic forces and a clear emphasis on human rights, and not an army, are the biggest barriers to the rise to power of radical groups. That is why these are things which now require our support, as do religious minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Experience of human rights work shows that freedom of religion is an important indicator of the situation with respect to human rights; it is a kind of litmus test. The problems are visible first in the status of religious groups and as flaws in the system of freedom of speech and right of assembly. There is a correlation between the state of play of democracy and the status of minorities: wherever the opportunities the people have to participate are poor, minorities also suffer.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We might say that Pakistan’s particular problem is the misuse of the law on blasphemy with regard to religious minorities. There should be a system of the protection of religious values, not active persecution of people of other faiths. Although the law is not targeted at any particular religious groups in terms of its content, the everyday reality is otherwise. Death sentences are handed down mainly in respect of minorities. Legal reform is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Only democracy will make this possible. The unfortunate decision by Musharraf to keep his position as army chief has had an impact on Pakistan’s social development these last few years, and has weakened it. The gradual militarisation of society has been regrettable.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the other hand, we express our support for Pakistan in its fight against Talibanisation. We feel solidarity with those Pakistanis who are affected by last week’s devastating bomb attack.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Last month I had the chance to familiarise myself personally with the political situation in Pakistan. I had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties, senators and members of parliament. I especially want to mention, however, the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, whose important work as the representative of many minority groups deserves the attention and support of the outside world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this House has repeatedly been dealing with the dire situation in Darfur, the last resolution having been adopted only in mid-September this year. The news that, at the end of September, a murderous attack took place against an African Union base in south Darfur, resulting in the death of 10 peacekeepers, the serious injury of eight other personnel, and the apparent taking hostage of approximately 40 people more, has come as a grim reminder that, despite our efforts, much remains to be done in order to secure peace and stability in this sad corner of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should, of course, recollect that at least 200 000 people have died in Darfur during the four-year conflict, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes. The September attack on African Union peacekeepers must force the EU and the UN to make sure that peacekeepers in Darfur are adequate in numbers and training, that they are properly and fully equipped and that they are given adequate logistical and other necessary support in order to fulfil their task safely and effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">Merely sending poorly trained and ill-equipped AU civilians into highly hazardous situations does not, as has been demonstrated in this case, serve any useful purpose other than to reduce the cost in terms of money but increase the cost in terms of human lives. An urgent rethink and replanning by the international community is essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage. Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, after losing ten men in the raid at Haskanita, the head of the African Union mission in Darfur, General Martin Luther Agwai, sounded an alarm call, highlighting the fact that his forces were ill-equipped and too few in number, and that they could be defeated in a very short time. There has, as yet, been no change in the situation, and further attacks like that of 29 September remain possible. The General’s alarm call must be heeded by the international community and particularly by the European Union, which could surely issue a powerful appeal for effective joint action by all the Member States involved in providing the promised EU support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In two days’ time, important talks are to take place in Libya between the Sudanese Government and various rebel forces. It is still unclear whether Abdel el-Nur – the founder of the Sudan Liberation Army, now exiled in France – will take part in these talks. Indeed, there is just as much uncertainty about other figures representing the array of rebel forces, for their numbers change from one day to the next. Be that as it may, we have to prioritise these discussions, which have the potential to produce a ceasefire. So once again we would ask the European Union authorities to spread the word as widely as possible about the importance of the meeting and about Europe’s intention to support any positive developments that may come out of it, both militarily and in relation to improving conditions for aid workers, who are operating in a particularly difficult situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also remind you that the Government in Khartoum, through its actions thus far, bears a huge share of responsibility for today’s tragic situation – and not only because it has supported the Janjaweed militias bringing death and terror to black African communities. It was also the Government that categorically refused, for months, to accept the presence of a Western force in Sudan. It was also the Government that made it impossible for journalists and foreign observers to gain access to the most troubled regions, even though their work there could make a major contribution to the ongoing mobilisation of international public opinion. That mobilisation is clearly needed if we are to ensure that all of us in Europe shoulder our responsibilities in combating what must be recognised as nothing short of genocide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another important point is that the new European force, due to deploy in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic, will make it harder for the rebels to move freely across the borders with those countries and to pursue their policy of recruiting fighters, willing or otherwise, from refugees’ and displaced persons’ camps. Anticipating this obstacle to their activities, some armed groups are already turning their attention to the other side of Darfur, to the neighbouring region of Kordofan, to which Haskanita is a gateway. Here too, the support the European Union has undertaken to provide may prove very useful, although within a short time it may also prove quite inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is thus part of our task to continue doggedly doing what we can to bring about political conditions in which European intervention will be effective. Surely we have seen enough violence and heartbreak in this region of the world? Not only have hundreds of thousands of lives already been lost, but the social fabric of Darfur is also being utterly devastated, so the task of reconstruction becomes more problematic from day to day.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the attack to which this resolution relates was targeted against a diplomatic solution to the situation in Sudan. The context is quite important, because the attack occurred shortly before Desmond Tutu was due to conduct meaningful talks in Darfur. It seems obvious that the attack was deliberately timed to thwart the quest for a diplomatic solution, which is so desperately needed in that region. There followed lengthy speculation, of course, as to the identity of the rebel group that had carried out the attack, which claimed the lives of ten soldiers from the AU peacekeeping force. The signs seem to indicate that the most likely perpetrators were a pro-Western rebel group.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we deal with the Darfur issue, it is important not to focus too narrowly, but to remember that the most widely diverse rebel groups from the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic are operating there in addition to the local armed forces on both sides.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it very revealing that the attempt made by the European Union to act on the Darfur conflict through the Chad mission is effectively in a sorry state at the present time. At the start, the talk was about sending an EU force there. In fact, a French force with a few additional troops has been sent there under the EU banner. I have not yet been able to obtain any proper information about that force’s actual area of operation. Although we are still being told that the force is essentially there to protect refugees, most of the refugees are to be found in the border area, which is precisely where the Government of Chad does not want the EU force deployed. Perhaps the Commissioner can assist again with some information.</p>
      <p sl="de">What the EU is doing at the moment is definitely not what is needed to defuse the present situation We have to say very clearly that the very thing Desmond Tutu wanted, namely a diplomatic solution, is what we ought to be supporting here.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, following its independence in 1956, Sudan, which is the largest country in Africa in terms of surface area, was supposed to be a home for everyone, for the Arab north and the Black south, for Muslims, Christians and animists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the civil war that has continued for almost 50 years has claimed at least two million victims in that country. Over 4.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes. In Darfur, where the conflict broke out at the beginning of 2003, about 200 000 have died and nearly two million have been driven from their homes. This is the result of terrible battles, purges and terror. This is currently the most tragic humanitarian crisis in the world, and it is further aggravated by hunger and the lack of water.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One should therefore be grateful to all those who undertake peace initiatives in this tortured land. We should address such thanks to the African Union, which sent a 7 000-strong peace mission there. The most recent attack on this mission, which took place in Haskanita, aroused strong objections. At least ten dead and about 50 lost or kidnapped. This is a clear breach of existing agreements as well as of United Nations resolutions. I would like to express my sympathy to the families of these persons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should, acting as the European Union, demand that those responsible be punished and that the peace process be reinstated. The planned forces of the UN mission together with the African Union will number about twenty thousand more soldiers. However, they must have some possibility to neutralise the armed conflict and help bring stability to this explosive corner of Africa. I hope that the European Parliament’s decision to award the Sakharov prize to the Sudanese lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will be helpful in making a breakthrough in the Sudanese drama.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I naturally wish to add my voice to the vigorous condemnation of the killing of the members of the peace-keeping forces.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, however, I also wish to remember all the civilians who were victims, and who are victims in the situation in Darfur, with particular reference to the brutality with which certain assaults with clear sexual overtones are being carried out and serious violations are taking place in terms of the way women are used on a variety of fronts, including sexually.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that all of this requires not only actions and declarations but a solid investigation which should be carried out not only by the people on the ground but also by the International Criminal Court. That, for me, is one of the fundamental aspects of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I also wish to note that we should welcome the fact that there is currently permission – to give it some kind of name, from the Government of Sudan to accept UNAMID troops but at the same time we should also note that on other occasions they have broken this commitment, broken this promise and therefore we should maintain a degree of caution.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, naturally, that it is necessary to continue to insist, while at the same time, as Mr Pflüger said, ensuring that the forces which go, go with a broad United Nations mandate, and not only to back the interests of one country in particular.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, I believe it is also essential and necessary to recall that all aid must be made available, whether political, financial or technical as may be required to perform the duties that that mission will have to face on the ground. It is not possible to send a mission into the field without its having guarantees that it will be able to fulfil its mandate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, and again very significantly, I would like to note, and here I undoubtedly go beyond the words of the Resolution, which urges the government of Sudan to follow the demands of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to arrest Ahmed Haroun, Sudan’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, specifically so that he can be held accountable for the displacement of two million people in Darfur, thereby instigating an international trial which should have begun some time ago.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are known: there was an attack on the AU peacekeeping force on 30 September; ten soldiers lost their lives, eight were seriously injured, and forty are still missing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July. During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan. It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives. For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier. All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness.</p>
      <p sl="de">The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa. There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it. Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission. When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower. The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations. This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel. Above all, however, we need the political will of everyone, and it is my opinion that peace in Darfur and the whole of Sudan can be achieved only in cooperation with China.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I will read from the press: ‘Just after the evening meal to break the Ramadan fast on 29 September, around 30 vehicles loaded with several hundred Sudanese rebels ripped through the perimeter of an African Union peacekeepers’ base on the edge of Haskanita, a small town in southern Darfur, the embattled province in western Sudan where at least 200 000 people and perhaps as many as 300 000 have been killed since the rebellion began in 2003.’</p>
      <p sl="de">The units of about 100 troops, most of them Nigerian, fought off the first attack before falling back to trenches, firing through the night until their ammunition ran out. Then, ten were killed. At least 40 fled into the bush. The attackers looted the compound before Sudanese troops rescued the survivors. A week later, Haskanita itself was razed. When the UN inspected the damage, only the school and the mosque were still standing. About 7 000 people are thought to have fled. Then, on 8 October, fighting erupted in the town of Muhajiriya, controlled by a Darfuri rebel faction. Scores were killed.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one is sure who the attackers were. Even the Government of Omar El Bashir came under suspicion. But it could be the rebels. What we know is that these things will continue to go on until there are international forces with an effective mandate and with effective means there. Everybody knows that, and it is time to stop this game of hide-and-seek with the Government of Khartoum.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the appalling attack by rebel forces in Haskanita against the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) was followed by a series of other revenge attacks by Government forces against all villages supposed to shelter rebels with tremendous civilian casualties.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must realise that this suits the genocidal strategy of the Bashir clique in Khartoum to divide and destroy the Darfur communities and the rebel groups in order to make peace negotiations, such as the ones that are supposed to start this weekend in Libya, go nowhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">That appalling attack and the violence which followed also demonstrate the fundamental limitations of an all-African force in Darfur such as AMIS. It is, therefore, crucial that the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which is to be deployed by early January, will actually be duly equipped in full force and capacity to operate by then.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, it is very disturbing that the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr Konaré, has been insisting on an all-African force, even rejecting the integration of units offered by Uruguay, Thailand and Norway into UNAMID, in contradiction with the UN Security Council decision and, in this way, echoing the manoeuvres of the clique in Khartoum.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also disturbing that the European Union, the US and other rich countries have been failing to provide the speedy and full support that they should give to the deployment of that mission, namely by not providing it with a financial airlift and other logistical and military capacities that it needs to operate. Even the Chad mission is very much delayed, and that was supposed to be ‘urgent’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr Bashir is going to be given a red carpet welcome in Lisbon: it is not only Mr Mugabe. I hope that the European Union authorities, the Commission and the Presidency and the Member States will not fail to take that opportunity to actually confront him with this tremendous responsibility that, one day, will bring him to The Hague.</p>

      <p sl="sv">First of all, our thoughts go out to the sons, brothers and loved ones who are now missing following the brutal attack on the AMIS force. These people died trying to help their fellow humans in a neighbouring country. Many have been affected by violence, rape, murder and extreme poverty here. How many times have we stood here and talked about it? How many times have we demanded that the government or others take action? Let me remind you that the central task of any government is to protect the human rights of its civilian population. This government has never attempted or tried to do this in its entire career. However, we must still be patient in our frustration, as it is only through long-term economic and political support for those who are endeavouring to resolve the conflict that we can do it. We must not altogether ignore our own economic interests. Sometimes it is our own oil companies that are actually supporting certain groups, indirectly or directly. We must address this too. A heavy responsibility rests with the government, and we must make further demands. I agree completely with my colleague Raül Romeva that the International Criminal Court must be given full access rights and a full right to investigate, so that the people in this stricken country can see justice in due course.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as Irish soldiers leave for Chad to protect refugees from neighbouring Sudan, I am again painfully reminded that this tragedy of genocide in Sudan continues day in and day out, without any end in sight. I congratulate this motion for deploring violence, for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan. ‘We must show a united front’, the motion suggests; and, whilst I applaud the notion, I fail to see how this can come to pass. You see, the UN itself is implicitly divided on the issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Efforts can only go so far while China, a deciding member, continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms. Once again, we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum. China exchanges Chinese weapons for Sudanese oil, and it is not rocket science to see that this is one of the most important ways in which the ongoing conflict is being sustained.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy. Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years. With Chinese arms exports – some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago – estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year, the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question.</p>
      <p sl="de">If this issue remains unaddressed, it is not just Sudan that will suffer. Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal. So, finally, I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people. For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN, but we must do this actively – if not, we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people.</p>

This is the question.</p>
      <p sl="en">We acknowledge the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of the presence of the UN peacekeeping force on Sudanese soil. Along with the rest of the international community, we intend to keep the Government to its word. We welcome the intention of the Government to declare a cessation of hostilities when negotiations commence in Libya on 27 October, yet the Government needs to go further. The European Commission also calls upon the Government of Sudan to engage meaningfully in negotiations intended to result in the equitable sharing of power and of wealth in Darfur. We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause. We also call upon them to participate wholeheartedly in the talks in Sirte.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of that, as you know, UN Security Council Resolution 1778, adopted on 25 September, mandates an international multidimensional force to contribute to the stabilisation of eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic and thus also guarantee the security of the local civilian population, refugees and displaced people and stabilise the situation in Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this basis, the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council on 15 October decided to send an interim and multidimensional European force of 3 000 troops, EUFOR Chad, as we call it, to support and complement in the short term the deployment of the UN contingent. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis, the deployment of this new EUFOR Chad mission and of a UN police mission in parallel with UNAMID in Sudan is, I think, a crucial step towards facilitating a durable solution of the conflict in Darfur and, ultimately, also towards the voluntary return of the Sudanese refugees who have settled in Chad. I can tell you that, at this very moment, an Irish General is there exploring the situation and exploring where exactly EUFOR should be deployed.</p>
      <p sl="en">But coming back to the question of Sudan itself, let me say that we firmly believe that the future of Sudan lies in the sharing of wealth and power, in a federal government and a federal arrangement. This is what the Government and the rebels agreed in Naivasha in January 2005, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending decades of civil war between the north and the south. The international community must stand firm behind this Comprehensive Peace Agreement. For if this agreement can be made to hold – yes, it is at present in difficulty, but these difficulties need not be terminal – this will demonstrate powerfully that similar arrangements can surely be extended to Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="en">So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the long-term equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country, we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We also back the efforts of the EU Special Representative to Sudan to facilitate peace in Darfur and, along with other donors, we stand ready to ensure that the peace dividend, in the shape of the rehabilitation and recovery of Darfur, follows closely on the heels of a renewed peace agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think it is in the interest of all the parties – the Government, the Darfur rebels, the countries of the Horn of Africa region and the international community – that Sudan stays together. However long and arduous, and at times discouraging, the Sirte talks might turn out to be, I think we must be steadfast for peace in Sudan. The unity of this country remains within our grasp.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I ask for your leniency, and that of my colleagues, in submitting a last-minute oral amendment on account of the fact that we have just been informed of the arrest of a prominent human rights defender in Iran. The amendment is to add to paragraph 15 the following sentence: ‘Condemns the arrest and imprisonment of human rights defender Dr Sohrab Razzaghi on 24 October 2007 and calls for his immediate and unconditional release;’</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already spoken with most of the other political groups, and they are in agreement.</p>
