      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the implementation of the directive on mediation in the Member States, its impact on mediation and its take-up by the courts (2011/2026(INI)) (A7-0275/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-008-000" speaker_id="2173" name="Arlene McCarthy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would really like to thank my colleagues and the committee staff for supporting my work on this report on mediation. This report was drawn up to check on how the 27 Member States are implementing the 2008 European mediation law and its guidelines. When we drafted this law in 2008, I know that some Members were not convinced of the need for a European directive, but I believe that the hearings and consultations we conducted demonstrated that we do need EU-wide guidelines on mediation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am receiving an increasing number of requests for assistance from my constituents who are involved in cross-border disputes: family disputes over custody, access to children and maintenance payments, property, housing problems, and businesses chasing payments they are owed in another EU Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Going to court is costly; in fact, 45% of small businesses said they would not pursue a claim in another EU court if the money owed was less than EUR 50 000, because they would end up paying more in costs. What a massive loss for our small businesses across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our findings in drawing up this report demonstrated that mediation is a very valuable tool for consumers and businesses. I think that the message to Member States today is that they need to do more to promote the benefits of mediation. They should provide more training for mediators and encourage the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct. I believe this is the case because best practice in mediation shows that across Europe, there is a 70% success rate with mediation cases and, in fact, this rises to 80% if the parties voluntarily choose mediation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, still only 1% of parties are taking up mediation in Europe. Again, the figures speak for themselves: going through the courts took, on average, an extra 331 to 446 days, involving extra legal costs of between EUR 12 000 and EUR 13 000 to settle the case. The experience in my own Member State is that litigation worth EUR 200 000 took 333 days, costing on average EUR 51 000, where mediation would have taken a mere 87 days and cost a fraction at EUR 9 000.</p>
      <p sl="en">One mediator told me that last year, he mediated 115 disputes in the UK. He had solved them within one week, and 30 were cross-border. Mediation is therefore a flexible, speedy and cost-effective way to resolve disputes; it allows the parties greater control; it gives them more responsibility in resolving their disputes; and I believe it is especially beneficial in family disputes concerning children, because it can dramatically shorten the period of time required to reach agreement, and this is better for children’s well-being and reduces anxiety, conflict and stress in the family.</p>
      <p sl="en">To quote another very convincing case: a dispute over an estate and will worth GBP 10 million, involving four parties, three jurisdictions – the UK, Switzerland and France – was solved by a mediator in one day. But by the time they reached mediation, EUR 5 million had already been swallowed up by the courts and lawyers across three different states, and it would have taken another two years to try and solve that problem in court.</p>
      <p sl="en">So today I want to encourage the Commission and Member States to continue to strengthen and implement the EU law and give consumers and businesses an alternative to costly legal disputes. Given the number of disputed property cases we have in the EU, I would also like to use today as an opportunity to ask the Commission and the Member States to make more use of mediation systems to assist our constituents in disputes such as the numerous cases we have in Spain and Cyprus. Establishing a mediation procedure to bring an end to these costly and lengthy disputes will, of course, increase these citizens’ access to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, we are largely satisfied with the work of the Member States in implementing this law, even though at the time of drafting, only 17 Member States had transposed the legislation. And we welcome, Commissioner Reding, the fact that you are starting infringement proceedings against nine Member States. We note that some Member States have gone further than the EU guidelines, but we hope that our committee report, based on practitioners’ and users’ views, will provide useful input so that we can better serve our citizens with an affordable and efficient system for access to justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. She has presented a very comprehensive report on something which I believe could be a wonderful alternative to court cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Access to justice is a cornerstone of the European area of justice, but mediation offers an important alternative to going to court in a cross-border dispute, as well as helping us to reach amicable settlements. As the rapporteur so rightly says, it saves time and money and also spares the parties involved in family cases the additional trauma of going to court.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms McCarthy’s report provides a political assessment of the way in which some Member States have implemented the provisions of the directive. I agree with the rapporteur that we have to aim for a strict application of the provisions. I am pleased that, through this report, more Member States will probably go for a smooth application.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur is correct that not all Member States have put in place measures to transpose the directive. Nine countries have not yet notified the national measures needed to fulfil the implementation of the directive. That is why, in July this year, the Commission began infringement proceedings by sending letters of formal notice to these nine countries. They have two months to reply. We will follow up these nine cases and also follow up the way in which the other Member States have already implemented the directive. We will check the conformity of national implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2012, I intend to present a communication on the way this directive has been implemented. It will focus on the effect of the directive with regard to the promotion of mediation. I absolutely agree with Parliament that it is not enough merely to have a directive: you must make people aware that this possibility exists. I would like to add that nothing in the directive should prevent Member States from applying similar provisions to internal mediation processes at home. It is not intended only for cross-border cases – where it is obligatory – but also for national purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Ms McCarthy, her collaborators and teams and the other parliamentarians very much. The proposal which is on the table is a great help in pushing for mediation to become more popular and more widely taken up.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, Ms McCarthy, I should like, naturally, to begin by greeting the rapporteur and congratulating her, since I believe that this report is extremely useful and that it, in fact, enables us to take new steps in the field of mediation. The report presents an overview, a selection of the solutions adopted by the various Member States in the implementation and application of Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We all know the benefits of mediation. On the one hand, it is an extrajudicial means of dispute resolution, which contributes to decongestion of the courts and the streamlining of the justice system, whilst, at the same time, providing the parties with the chance to reach an amicable solution that is faster, less costly and less burdensome than the disputes in which they are engaged. It is therefore appropriate to reaffirm the objective of Article 1 of the directive, which calls for the adoption of measures encouraging the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, particularly mediation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Promoting access to and the use of extrajudicial means of dispute resolution contributes to improving and simplifying our justice system, and to making it more accessible. It is, therefore, a very important challenge for the European Union and for the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice; and even for the concept of rule of law within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why, in this context of crisis too, I consider it very important, as the report says, to be able to increase understanding of this area amongst the public and those involved in the judicial system, and I call here on the Commission, and on you, Commissioner, for a legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution to be tabled quickly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, cross-border mediation in legal disputes can be effective only when Member States enact appropriate legislation at national level. The European Commission reiterated this again on 20 August this year, because at present, EU legislation on mediation has still not been implemented in every country, although the deadline for transposition passed on 21 May this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">By promoting and facilitating access to alternative forms of justice for ordinary people, we are giving the citizens an instrument which is both effective and cheap. Recent research financed by the European Commission estimates that the amount of time wasted in the EU by not using mediation in disputes comes to between 331 and 446 days, and that the average extra legal costs associated with this reach a level in excess of EUR 13 500 per case.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Poland, mediation in civil cases was introduced to the national legal system as long ago as July 2005 by amendment of the Code of Civil Procedure. The changes made concur with the directive in the main objectives and the method of creating a separate institution of mediation in procedural law, as well as in the need for doing so. Unfortunately, the statistics from my country show that mediations are attempted in only a tiny percentage of all court cases – it is estimated that on average, only anywhere from 20 to 40 mediations are undertaken in civil cases each year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The inadequate education of society and the lack of promotion of this relatively new form of justice are hindering its development. Most citizens do not know of the existence of mediation and simply do not make use of it. Therefore, in the interests of the citizens, the Member States should intensively develop programmes which promote this form of resolving disputes. The benefits of mediation, both in financial terms and in terms of reducing the burden on the justice system, as well as the time savings involved, are invaluable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms McCarthy, on her excellent work.</p>

    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="4544" name="Diana Wallis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I wish to thank Mrs Reding for her words. It is so good to see Parliament doing a report on implementation, especially at this stage in the life of a directive – almost contemporaneous with the moment that it comes into force. I would like to pay tribute to the work that Mrs McCarthy has done. Parliament has shown itself at its best in looking at what has happened in the various Member States and highlighting what needs to be done, and also what has been done well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to admit that I was one of those sceptics that Mrs McCarthy referred to. I was nervous when a directive was first proposed, because Parliament, when looking at the Green Paper, had said first of all that we did not want legislation because we were concerned that this would threaten the diversity and experimentation which we saw taking place in mediation across the Member States. I have to say we have seen, through our workshop and through this report, that nothing could be further from the truth. The directive has done a good job in providing a framework – a framework which allows experimentation and the diversity of approaches to flourish across the Member States. It is not a straitjacket, but it does provide sufficient legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are problems. Clearly not everybody has implemented as they should; some practitioners mutter about problems to do with the confidentiality of the process. However, we should take heart from the fact that mediation is now seen as a method which is much more modern, and more contemporaneous, in providing access to cross-border justice. If one looks back at medieval ways of providing answers to legal disputes – trial by battle, trial by ordeal – traditional justice looks almost as medieval by comparison to mediation, which provides an easier solution, with less stress to the parties and to society as a whole.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="96757" name="Raffaele Baldassarre" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC shows that mediation is a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach, in that it allows for the amicable settlement of disputes and thus reduces the workload of the courts. This is confirmed by the various initiatives taken by some Member States, which are encouraging, where possible, the use of mediation through financial incentives or legislative provisions.</p>
      <p sl="it">In view of that, I should like to draw attention to certain aspects that I believe deserve further thought and consideration, starting with the issue of costs: we should follow the example of Member States that have tackled this problem by providing financial incentives to use mediation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe that we need to explore other possibilities, such as the use of awareness campaigns to promote the use and understanding of alternative forms of dispute resolution, especially on the part of businesses. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary also, and above all, to involve members of the legal system, who must see the added value of mediation as something that enhances, rather than competes with, their work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, looking ahead to the forthcoming Commission communication on the implementation of the directive and, in particular, to the imminent legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution, I should like to emphasise the way in which mediation complements other reforms of EU law, in particular, the approach to forms of collective redress and to contract law.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, as a preliminary measure, mediation can be an excellent alternative to forms of collective redress and can make an important contribution to the future instrument on contract law, significantly reducing the use of dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-014-000" speaker_id="96832" name="Kinga Göncz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament is paying special attention to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the implementation and transposition of the directive. A key feature of democracy is that it allows for conflicts to be resolved within a regulated institutional framework. After their interests have been identified, the parties involved can reach agreements which they will be likely to adhere to, and which can preserve their relations despite their prior involvement in conflict. Mediation is one means of achieving this, and has proven itself effective in numerous areas: from family and child custody disputes to issues of child custody litigations and out-of-court settlement of judicial affairs. Moreover, economic and financial, or community and minority disputes also often find effective resolution in this way.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Despite all this, it appears that mediation is not known widely enough among European citizens; maybe the current debate and the current report can contribute to a broader awareness and application of this mechanism. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of mediation is that it is accessible to vulnerable persons who would otherwise have difficulty asserting their rightful interests. Of course, the points mentioned here, such as relieving courts, shortening the duration of civil actions, saving on costs and so on, are all important. The report also reveals that there are considerable differences between individual Member States as to the progress made in transposing and applying the directive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In my opinion, there are many areas where further integration is necessary. While we must obviously maintain diversity, it would still be useful if Member State practices in the field of educational accreditation could be coordinated, and the same goes for confidentiality rules and the agreement becoming final. These are some of the reasons why we are looking forward to the communication the Commission has promised for 2013.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015-000" speaker_id="96874" name="Alexandra Thein" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, securing better access to justice is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s policy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. In a modern, globalised and digital economy, the confidence of the citizens in justice is a crucial factor. The Mediation Directive represents a milestone in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, every judge in the EU has the opportunity to ensure, in every phase of the process, that two parties to a dispute voluntarily and on their own responsibility strive, with the assistance of a mediator, to settle their differences amicably. The directive ensures that utilisation of the mediation process will prevent the expiry of limitation and prescription periods. Moreover, the agreements reached as a result of limitation and prescription could be given the status of enforceable official documents. Also important are sound training of the mediators in the field of quality assurance and the strengthening of citizens’ trust in this system.</p>
      <p sl="de">Most Member States announced transposition after the deadline for transposition had already passed. However, it is not only the fact that transposition takes place that is important – how transposition is effected is the most important thing. To that end, specialists and legal practitioners must be consulted in order to ensure the greatest possible improvement of the directive.</p>

    <intervention id="2-016-000" speaker_id="1941" name="Roberta Angelilli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work. As the European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction, I particularly welcomed paragraph 14 of the motion for a resolution, which emphasises that parties are more willing to consider the other party’s position and to work on the underlying issues of the dispute through the mediation process, and that this often has the added benefit of preserving the relationship the parties had before the dispute, which is of particular importance in family matters involving children.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as preventing lengthy court cases, the use of mediation, where practicable, actually results in an agreement between parties – and personally I hope that this practice can be extended as much as possible, including for family mediation.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Commissioner Reding pointed out, mixed marriages are on the increase in Europe: every year in the EU, there are more than 350 000 cross-border marriages and 170 000 divorces, which equates to 20% of all divorces in the European Union. When a marriage ends, the children can become the subject of dispute. Often the parent who has custody keeps the children without the consent of the other parent, or the parent who does not have custody of the children abducts them or refuses to give them back after a scheduled visit.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of international parental child abductions in recent years. In many cases, however, the mediation process has enabled those children to resume contact with both parents. An agreement reached between parties through a mediation process can actually stop children from suffering unnecessarily and enables parents to address all their family issues without having to face long, costly and painful court proceedings.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017-000" speaker_id="28323" name="Oldřich Vlasák" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I firmly believe that mediation, just like other forms of alternative dispute resolution, is a useful thing. Its benefits are undisputed. I would like to emphasise the main advantage of mediation, which is to bring about amicable, and therefore mutually acceptable, solutions. On the other hand, however, there are a number of disadvantages associated with mediation. Its chief characteristic, in other words, its voluntary nature, can also work in a negative way. The other party cannot be forced to complete the process until it has reached its final form.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, the adoption of the directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial cases by the European Parliament and the Council in 2008, following four years of tough negotiations, broke another taboo of European integration. Although this directive did not have the aim of harmonising or even of creating the uniform regulation of mediation throughout the EU, it does regulate the field of mediation. At the same time, it exerts indirect pressure on states that lack any regulation of the mediation process. Article 5 of the directive also provides for the mandatory use of mediation, which, in my opinion, is contrary to the fundamental principle of mediation, which is its voluntary nature. Just like mediation itself, the European directive does not bring only positive results.</p>
      <p sl="cs">All EU Member States should have introduced measures by now implementing the EU legislation into their law. Nine countries, however, including the Czech Republic, have yet to announce all of the internal measures necessary for full implementation of the directive. Why is this? Mediators are, in fact, already operating in the Czech Republic, but they work on the basis of a trading licence as advisers. A mediation act was debated by Parliament some years ago, but the bill was not passed by MPs. They were unhappy about a passage under which couples unable to reach an agreement would have to use the services of a mediator. In mid-June this year, the government passed a bill on mediation in non-criminal cases. Controversial points in the act included, for example, insurance for mediators, the method for testing them and the qualification requirements they would have to fulfil. We must therefore wait a while longer for the statutory regulation of mediation in non-criminal cases in the Czech Republic. We ought to consider whether it is really necessary to put pressure on states through a European regulation to adopt something which is already working in those states and which should rather, as a matter of principle, be of a voluntary nature.</p>

    <intervention id="2-018-000" speaker_id="96818" name="Salvatore Iacolino" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what Ms Reding said just now is undoubtedly correct and a step in the right direction: charging non-compliant States with failure to notify their implementing measures and potentially launching infringement proceedings against them suggests that in a single market such as the European market, we should have common legal rules, too.</p>
      <p sl="it">Making mediation compulsory is certainly an important objective but, at the same time, we should acknowledge the role of cost in the mediation process. There is no doubt that mediation costs can add to the costs of a court case if mediation itself does not work out, and this is another particularly relevant issue. It is also important for mediators to be skilled, capable and knowledgeable, just as it is clear that the poor take-up of mediation is probably due to insufficient information from the Member States themselves.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mediation means relieving congestion in the courts, especially with regard to civil cases, and it is equally important that it should have the scope to become a key instrument in matters involving children, which are obviously of particularly great interest to us.</p>

    <intervention id="2-019-000" speaker_id="96654" name="Jaroslav Paška" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the practice of dispute resolution in the civil and commercial sphere through mediation under the EC directive of 2008 is bringing its first results, as it helps to resolve disputes without burdening the courts directly. Substantial reductions are being achieved in the burden on courts, particularly in those countries where dispute resolution via mediation is also supported by a system of incentives. The fact that agreements on the recognition of disputes via mediation are given equal weight in most countries to court rulings, and that the mediation process is far cheaper for the parties involved in the procedure from a financial perspective, gives this practice good prospects for further expansion. In the future, we should perhaps, as well as promoting this method of dispute resolution, aim for a proper definition of the requirements for access to the profession of mediator, particularly in terms of the necessary professional training and qualifications and the relevant accreditation within an EU framework.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am in favour of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms being available to the parties in a civil dispute. Indeed, I am in favour of incentives with regard to the cost of using them and disincentives for those refusing to use them. However, I am not in favour of the European Union passing legislation, even in the form of a directive. It is for Member States to decide on procedural law as well as substantive law.</p>
      <p sl="en">I prefer the use of arbitration to mediation. Arbitration inevitably leads to a decision, whereas mediation simply might facilitate a negotiated settlement – but if it does not, it will simply add to costs. Nevertheless, in matrimonial and custody cases, I believe mediation is suitable, largely because in such cases, negotiated settlements are desirable in themselves, as they are more likely to be observed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would again like to thank the rapporteur for her good work and for the very objective and constructive discussion we have had in this plenary.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that mediation is a good example of modern justice. This directive is not a straitjacket for Member States, but a framework under which they can develop their own systems. It is very important in dealing with the hugely complicated area of cross-border affairs, which we are trying to solve with one European measure after another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mediation is also very important for the parties involved because it is a win-win situation, as compared to lengthy court procedures – most of all (as has been said several times in this Chamber) for family affairs. We need to have a broad information campaign in order to inform citizens that mediation is possible and to train the mediators so that they can be very efficient in carrying out mediation between the parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been questions about alternative dispute resolution (ADR). I would like to inform the Chamber that in March 2011, a public consultation on commercial transactions took place. The responses we received show very strong support mostly for ADR schemes in consumer disputes and also many demands for ADR in online disputes. As a reaction to this, my colleague, Commissioner Dalli, will, by the end of this year, prepare a legislative proposal on ADR in B2C and then, in the context of the digital agenda, there will be a regulation on online ADR in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have asked my services to examine the issue of ADR in B2B (business-to-business) questions, and here legislation is foreseen in 2012. Because there is a lot of interest in the House with regard to family affairs – and rightly so – a working group on family mediation has been set up as a follow-up to the ministerial conference on family mediation held under the Belgian Presidency in December 2010 and a discussion in the Council. We are taking this very seriously and are trying to bring the matter forward. You are absolutely right: particularly in the case of children, mediation is a much better solution than a court procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is the most important overhaul of the law which established Frontex in 2004, and Parliament greatly welcomes it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The establishment of the agency in 2004 coincided with the start of a massive flow of migration towards Europe via different routes. First via Spain, and, in particular, the Canary Islands; then via Italy, and the Italian island of Lampedusa, and Malta; later via Greece, and so on and so forth. So, in a way, this agency was asked to start running before it could walk. Therefore, all in all, our assessment of the first six years of experience of the agency is that it needs to be strengthened and made more effective because, despite all good intentions, it has not lived up to expectations so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal to change the law was presented by the Commission, and already in the Commission proposal we had extremely good ideas which were certainly good steps forward. I hope that Parliament has improved on this proposal with the help of the Hungarian Presidency, in particular, and the Council of Ministers continues to build on these good points.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I had to synthesise the contribution of Parliament, I would divide it into four points. I will say something about each.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first point is that we tried to increase the visibility of the agency. We did this, in particular, by giving the border guards engaged in Frontex missions the name they really deserve. They should be called ‘European border guards’, and therefore we have given this new name to people who, fair enough, will be national border guards coming from national services, but will be participating in European missions under Frontex. For that reason, they should be called European border guards, rather than unintelligible phrases such as ‘Frontex joint support teams’ or, worse, ‘rapid border intervention teams’: ‘RABITS’!</p>
      <p sl="en">Within one year, the Commission has promised to look at the feasibility of actually going that one step further along the path towards the establishment of European border guards proper.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second area where we have made a contribution relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the agency; here, we focused on compulsory solidarity. This means that once a Member State decides – and commits itself – to pool a number of border guards or make some equipment, such as vessels, planes or helicopters, available to the agency, it will now be legally obliged to honour its promises. That was not previously the case, which explains to a large extent why the agency was not deemed to be effective in its missions, because when it turned to the Member States, they did not deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agency will also be able to purchase, lease, own or even co-own its own equipment from now on. Of course, we do not expect it to have an army of sorts by any means, but we want the agency to have basic equipment which will enable it to engage in missions, especially in emergencies. We will also give the agency the power to process personal data – under strict conditions – if this can help it in the fight against crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">On human rights – which was a key point for this Parliament – we have agreed on important improvements to the Commission proposal. For instance, any Frontex mission where a violation of human rights occurs will now be suspended or terminated. We will also appoint a fundamental rights officer in the agency and a consultative forum on human rights, and we will monitor return operations in terms of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we will also increase the democratic scrutiny of the agency, which will therefore be held increasingly accountable to Parliament. Madam President, that is already a mouthful, and I will stop my introduction at this point. I very much look forward to this debate and, hopefully, I will come back to some points later.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Council welcomes the agreement which has been reached on amendment of Council Regulation No 2007/2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, or Frontex.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament and the Council have called several times in the last few years for Frontex to be strengthened. Recent events in North Africa and the resultant increased influx of immigrants across the European Union’s southern maritime borders have also demonstrated the great importance of strengthening the agency’s operational capabilities. In a declaration adopted on 11 March this year, the European Council called for agreement to be reached quickly on strengthening Frontex’s capabilities, and in the conclusions of 25 March, it called for agreement to be reached by June this year. The fact that it has been possible to meet this deadline for completion of this work is the result of intensive efforts both in the Council and in Parliament and also of the negotiations between our two institutions. Both institutions had to compromise in many areas to achieve a satisfactory result. I should like particularly to call attention to and express my thanks for the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency and the European Parliament’s negotiating team under the leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Following its establishment in October 2005, Frontex quickly began operations, and currently plays a key role in leading operational cooperation at the European Union’s external borders. The agency coordinates a number of joint operations and pilot projects at the EU’s external borders, concentrating, in particular, on several high risk areas, such as the Union’s southern maritime borders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Amendment of the regulation is an important step. It significantly extends the agency’s responsibilities. In a number of areas, it puts the agency in a better position to be able to carry out both its current and its new roles in better ways. This includes setting up European border guard teams – previously named ‘joint support teams’, and Rabits, or ‘rapid border intervention teams’ – as a joint resource available for use in all Frontex operations. It also contains improved provisions on funding and ensuring the availability of appropriate technical crew and staffing resources. Frontex will also be mandated to pay special attention to Member States which are experiencing specific and disproportionate pressures on their asylum systems. The amended regulation contains improved provisions on the protection of fundamental rights, including the establishment of a consultative forum on fundamental rights and the designation of a fundamental rights officer. The code of conduct will guarantee respect for fundamental rights, and in cases of human rights violations, Frontex operations will have to be suspended or terminated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, provisions will be introduced concerning processing by the agency of personal data collected in the course of its operations. The agency’s capacity to carry out risk analyses will be improved, to enable a faster reaction to new and emerging situations. Furthermore, new provisions will be introduced on training and research. The agency’s coordinating role has been strengthened in relation to joint return operations and the possibility of launching technical assistance projects and delegating liaison officers to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Presidency is in no doubt that the change in Frontex’s mandate will significantly strengthen its operational capabilities. I would like to express my profound satisfaction that the European Union’s external borders are to be managed with greater efficiency. I am pleased, too, with the Commission’s commitment to conduct a feasibility study on the creation of a European system of border guards. This will allow the process of strengthening European Union policy on border management to develop in the next few years. Permit me, Madam President, to conclude by thanking Parliament again for its constructive approach to this resolution. I am counting on confirmation of the outcome of our negotiations at today’s vote. Thank you very much.</p>

    <intervention id="2-028-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, for his work, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, and also the last troika – the Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies – for the efforts made so that we can come to a vote today on this very important matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without effective border management, the Schengen system cannot function effectively and the security of the EU may be put at risk. We have seen increasing challenges in recent years. Some Member States have been exposed to considerable migratory pressures at their external borders, and this must be dealt with in a spirit of solidarity and common responsibility. At the same time, of course, we must make sure that people who turn to Europe seeking protection are dealt with in a way that is in compliance with our values and with international laws and standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The effective management of Member States’ external borders must be continuously improved to respond to the new challenges. Weaknesses at some sections of the border must be tackled. Our citizens need to be reassured that external border controls are working properly. This is, of course, primarily the Member States’ responsibility, but Frontex and the European Union can contribute substantially to achieving these goals, and we have seen increased demand by Member States for the services of Frontex since its establishment in 2005. Frontex has also been involved in many very important projects and operations lately in Greece and also, with the Hermes operation, in Italy, where Frontex is helping to assist the authorities as well as actually saving lives at sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">Based on a number of evaluations, but also on the desire of the European Council and the European Parliament to improve and strengthen the legal framework of the agency, we at the Commission identify proposals, and submitted one almost 18 months ago now. It was also important for the Commission to be very clear on the human rights responsibilities of Frontex to ensure its continued legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strengthening of Frontex had different connotations for different stakeholders. Member States are looking to increase financial resources, while Parliament wanted to improve the availability of technical resources and strengthen respect for fundamental rights, so it took us some time to negotiate this. But now we have reached a high-quality compromise that, I think, stresses the correct balance between the different interests in play. I am confident that the new regulation will enhance the work of the agency, especially through the European border guard teams, which will consolidate the EU character of this work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The requirement for Member States to honour their promises regarding human rights is being strengthened. I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their support in ensuring that Frontex should only carry out joint operations if the necessary guarantees are provided regarding absolute respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and the right to international protection of those in need. I think the requirement for Member States to honour their promises regarding the human and technical resources they put at the disposal of the agency will also enable the agency to better plan and conduct joint operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, Frontex-funded return operations will be monitored to ensure objective and transparent criteria. To that end, the Commission is providing today, for inclusion in the minutes, a Commission declaration on the monitoring of return operations. The monitoring of returns, the clauses allowing the agency to suspend or terminate joint operations, and the creation of a consultative forum and a fundamental rights officer, are all major steps forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strengthening of the operation and capability of the agency, including the possibility for the agency to acquire its own equipment, will put it in a position to cope in a cost-effective manner with the ever-increasing demands of Member States for it to coordinate border control activities and return operations. Furthermore, the changes mean Frontex will also have a mandate to process personal data obtained during operations coordinated by the agency to use in the fight against crime and human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="en">Controlling external borders is only one aspect of border management. Cooperation with countries of origin or transit is another. This regulation will enhance cooperation with the relevant authorities in third countries, and the agency will have the possibility of providing technical assistance to relevant third countries to increase the level of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">If a decision is taken today, I think all three institutions can be proud. We have achieved a framework and laid the ground for a more effective, more operational, more visible and more legitimate Frontex Agency. I would like to thank everybody involved.</p>

    <intervention id="2-029-000" speaker_id="96728" name="Barbara Lochbihler" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in particular, in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, have worked intensively on the report and on improving Frontex. We have tabled a highly comprehensive catalogue of measures for how Frontex’s work can be designed and improved in conformance with human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Commissioner Malmström stated, things could not go on as before. Too little was known about how Frontex works, and the agency did not enjoy a good standing in the media and in the individual Member States. It was very often asked how it can be that thousands of people are drowning and no one comes to their rescue. A few journalists and refugee organisations have also documented failures to even render assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it should be viewed in a positive light that we have now nonetheless achieved a situation, at Parliament’s proposal, whereby Frontex staff are to be given human rights training, we have obtained a fundamental rights officer, there is an agreement with the Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna and a report will have to be filed in the event of misconduct or certain other occurrences. These are all positives.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to point out, however, that we have not managed to get a majority behind the idea of Frontex having an independent observer who could also monitor these new rules and who could, for example, participate in individual missions. The question of whether what we have achieved will actually be applied will thus remain, and I believe that we continue to need independent monitoring by non-State actors.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Busuttil, to the Commission and to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the Union’s greatest achievements, enabling almost 500 million people to move freely within its territory.</p>
      <p sl="es">The removal of internal borders meant that the peripheral countries were obliged to strengthen their border controls, a function which, as you will recall, falls within the exclusive competence of the countries concerned. The land-locked countries benefit from the free area, but occasionally they forget that this situation is largely due to the effort made by Member States with external boundaries, an effort which is bound to increase in situations where there is a migration crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">To an ever-increasing extent, these situations require the intervention of Frontex. However, the agency’s ability to react is limited as it lacks the necessary resources. This lack of resources is due in large part to the lack of real commitment on the part of certain Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thus, it was necessary and appropriate to strengthen the Frontex Regulation, clearly defining the agency’s role and providing the legal instruments enabling it to be equipped with the necessary means and resources needed to carry out its goals in full accordance with fundamental rights. The provision of economic, material and human resources cannot depend on the good will of only some Member States, since solidarity should be binding and general.</p>
      <p sl="es">Frontex should also coordinate its activities with Europol and Eurojust to fight organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office is an essential element in ensuring access to international protection. The creation of a system of border guards is an interesting proposal which may be brought about if it is implemented through the compulsory solidarity clause.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, approval of the proposed regulation will make it possible to manage migratory flows better, fight the mafias more effectively and improve the common asylum system.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I, too, should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the results that he has managed – with no little difficulty – to achieve on a particularly sensitive and thorny issue in the negotiations with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, it is important to mention a number of positive points that can be described as definite progress, even though I admit that my group and I would have appreciated the opportunity to have gone a little further in this reform. We have managed to ensure, then, that the agency will take more care to respect fundamental rights when carrying out its missions. This seems obvious, but it still needed to be established in clear terms. A specialist officer will therefore have access to all information relating to fundamental rights and will perform his or her tasks independently. The agency will have to assist the Member States in situations involving humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea – and we have seen how important this is in recent months. Operations will be suspended in the event of a fundamental rights violation. Agreements made by Frontex with third countries will have to meet European fundamental rights standards. The principle of non-refoulement, or non-return of migrants, will be upheld in all cases. All of this is along the right lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new regulation is also intended to make Frontex more efficient. To this end, the Member States will have to make a firm commitment to equip the agency with personnel and resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third acknowledged step forward concerns the increased democratic scrutiny of Frontex. The European Parliament will have a very direct involvement in this, even though future amendments to this regulation will, I hope, strengthen MEPs’ right of scrutiny. Three topics, three types of progress that sound obvious but that were, nonetheless, very difficult to obtain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two final ideas before I finish. Frontex is, and must continue to be, seen for what it is, namely, a tool to help the EU’s external border surveillance strategy. Frontex is neither a perfect alibi nor a tool for the Member States to use in support of their own migration policies. This is an issue that we will have to work on and which I believe will continue to raise questions with regard to respective responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, while we are talking about Schengen, we should all remember that European migration policy has many other challenges to address apart from that of Frontex, in the areas, for example, of integration and resettlement, and of access to fair and equitable protection. We hope that the EU as a whole will demonstrate the same political will on these issues, too. In this way, we will be able, I believe, to talk about progress in relation to a Europe of asylum and migration.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, during this part-session, Parliament is to vote on a revised and strengthened mandate for Frontex. I am proud and very pleased to have been able to be part of the team that has been led in such an excellent manner by Mr Busuttil. I would like to express my thanks for everyone’s constructive cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As we all know, Frontex is a new authority that has only been operating for six years, and when something is new, there is reason to review operations in order to be able to improve them further for the future. In this report that we now have here, we demonstrate how we can make further improvements to the high-quality work that Frontex does.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I welcome the fact that the authority will now have a clearer mandate and I see it as a positive development that Member States will now contribute by providing both human resources and equipment in order to provide Frontex with the conditions it needs to do a really good job. It is very good that we have succeeded in ensuring respect for human rights in the work of Frontex. This means, among other things, that operations can now be suspended or terminated if violations of human rights are suspected. We are also setting up a body within the authority that will have the specific task of monitoring whether human rights are being respected. I am very pleased to say that it is solely down to Parliament that this has come about. I am very proud of that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also welcome the fact that, in a statement, Parliament is sending a very important political signal by choosing to speak of ‘irregular migrants’ instead of ‘illegal migrants’. No person is ever illegal. I look forward to the day when this term is also amended in our treaties. That will take time, but we must always dare to believe that that day will come. In an EU where we have eradicated the internal borders, it is important for our external borders to be respected and controlled in a proper and effective manner. This report will help us to start to see a development along these lines and we can have well-functioning border management without it requiring us to build ‘Fortress Europe’. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his excellent work, and everyone else, too. My group will support the report in its entirety.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Frontex Agency is an agency that has been untouched by the crisis, given that its budget has increased from just over EUR 6 million in 2005 to more than EUR 80 million today. In other words, Frontex has grown without facing any awkward questions for many years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ultimately, the Member States saw something to be gained from this: firstly, the availability of resources for their own internal operations; secondly, the opportunity to turn to Frontex when faced with countries that were seen to be failing to control their borders; and thirdly, the increase in Frontex’s powers and resources, which everyone was calling for. This also enabled the Director of Frontex, only two years ago, to tell MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who were worried about human rights being violated, that it was not Frontex’s job to deal with that issue; it was the responsibility of the Member States!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Frontex has ultimately grown against this backdrop of irresponsibility with regard to human rights. I think that, today, it is really to the credit of Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, that the issue of fundamental rights protection was placed so high on the agenda of the negotiations. I say this, of course, because the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and Frontex is now accountable for its actions to the Court of Justice, which is no small thing; and also because a number of reports show that the principle of non-refoulement has been violated several times during Frontex operations and that access to asylum application procedures, which is an inviolable and international right, has been somewhat mismanaged. We are also awaiting a report from Human Rights Watch, which will show that Frontex is responsible, to some extent, for the unfair detention of migrants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore had a real problem with regard to respect for human rights, and I believe that the negotiations have enabled us to make serious progress in this area. Nevertheless, this does not mean that my group will be voting in favour of this mandate, because we believe that independence – as mentioned by Ms Lochbihler in particular – independent observation, and reliable, impartial and independent procedures for combating human rights violations, have not been established. This is what will ultimately lead my group to abstain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I should like to take advantage of this debate in order to question the Commission and the Council on the results and the status of Operation Hermes, the most recent Frontex operation: boats, helicopters, 2 000 drowned in the Mediterranean since the NATO intervention in Libya. What did Frontex do during this time? I do not know.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there can scarcely be another institution established by the European Union that is so controversial when it comes to human rights as Frontex is. This agency is associated with shameful images on the high seas where thousands of people have lost their lives, of land borders where people are kept in custody and where deep trenches are now being dug. At heart, Frontex embodies an erring policy towards refugees in Europe, refugees who leave their homelands not only as a result of political persecution, but also for economic reasons – simply to survive – as a result of hunger, civil wars and climate disasters.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new Frontex mandate does incorporate real and substantial improvements – and for that I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil – such as the obligation to respect human dignity, the right of non-refoulement, non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture, the respect of refugee minors, and the guaranteeing of data protection. Rescues at sea are now finally to be given stability and there is to be a code of conduct for border officials – but it is also true that the mandate does not lay down a principle of refraining from the use of violence. Furthermore, who is to be responsible for actually checking up on proportionality and appropriateness?</p>
      <p sl="de">Frontex is having its competence clearly expanded as the lead body in border patrols and as the body that produces risk analyses, on the basis of which interventions and the return to their homelands of thousands and thousands more migrants will take place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Heaven knows how hard Parliament struggled to obtain improvements, but they will make no difference to the fact that a wolf is still a wolf, even if it is dressed in sheep’s clothing. Frontex is not necessary either as a border agency – the national defence institutions serve that purpose – or to repel migration, as migration is not, in fact, repelled, but merely territorially displaced. Frontex is absolutely not suitable to act as custodian of human rights, given that, ultimately, it categorises people as legal or illegal. People cannot be illegal! I do not understand how that is not accepted.</p>
      <p sl="de">In place of Frontex, what we need is a humanisation of the refugee situation, in Africa, for example, where almost a million refugees live in degrading conditions. That does not interest us, or only does so to a limited extent. We would rather take care of ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need an asylum system that demonstrates solidarity, at European level too, of course, and we definitely need a new neighbourhood policy on an equal footing. That, too, still lies ahead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is indeed a massive problem with illegal immigration into Europe. The effects of this problem are especially felt in England and, in particular, in my constituency of London. England attracts immigration – illegal and legal – because of the possibilities for work and our generous benefits and housing systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK Independence Party would not be opposed to genuine cooperation between European nation states to counter the problems of illegal immigration – but this proposal is not about genuine cooperation. It seeks to change the legal basis on which Frontex operates and gives it more so-called competences. It will, for example, give Frontex the ability to cooperate with third-party countries on behalf of the EU. This proposal is yet another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal is another step in introducing the European Union’s common immigration and asylum policy as enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. As I will never tire of saying, the Lisbon Treaty was undemocratically imposed on the peoples of Europe without their consent. The Lisbon Treaty was illegal under existing English constitutional law, and everything that stems from it is therefore illegal in England.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another problem here, which is the European Convention on Human Rights. British courts are obligated to protect the human rights of foreign nationals in the UK. Once in the UK, they only have to claim that their human rights are likely to be at risk in their own country and the courts will not send them home. As a result of this, we have given refuge to all kinds of criminals.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I heard him correctly, Mr Busuttil said that all operations would be suspended while a human rights issue was being considered. This is like baling out a boat with a bucket that has an enormous hole in the bottom. The UK Independence Party will vote against this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Frontex is a border control agency that has been prevented from controlling borders. In the explanatory statement from the rapporteur, its function of preventing illegal migration is so understated as to become almost invisible. The need to ‘keep borders open for people who need protection’ and to work hand-in-hand with the European Asylum Office is stated boldly and confidently, placing that need at the centre of its concerns. This means that those who describe themselves as asylum seekers must be welcomed with open arms regardless of the reality of their status. Quite rightly, there is coverage of the need to cut cross-border crime, in which case why have a border-free Schengen area? Illegal migration, however, is mentioned only in hushed terms.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are told that Frontex must respect fundamental rights. If that means that migrants must not be ill-treated, then that is absolutely right. However, what it means in practice is the principle of so-called non-refoulement, which means that illegal migrants from dangerous countries must not be returned to those countries even if they are not at any particular risk compared with other residents. The logic of that principle is that all of the populations of dangerous countries should be brought to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Frontex is quite rightly told to rescue illegal migrants in danger. However, once they have been saved, they gain asylum status and cannot be returned to the countries from which they come. The words ‘moral’ and ‘blackmail’ come to mind.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Mr Miller, Commissioner Malmström, I should like to begin by saying that in order for us to have freedom of movement and an area of freedom, security and justice, we need integrated and uniform management of the external borders ensuring a high and uniform level of control and surveillance; that is a vital prerequisite. In order for us to have an integrated system for managing borders, we require the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and it must play a fundamental role in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Taking account of the rise in migration pressures, which entail new threats and risks, I believe it is easy to understand why there was a need to strengthen Frontex’s role and to provide it with more resources and tools in order to make it more effective. Moreover, in the context of the new assessment system for Schengen that we are discussing, there is also a need for Frontex to have more competences and, therefore, more responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of this, I believe it is only fair to congratulate our colleague, Mr Busuttil, on the fantastic work he has carried out in order to reach this agreement. I should like to highlight five points: firstly, the strengthening of provisions on fundamental rights, which several speakers have already mentioned and which is a significant milestone in this agreement; secondly, increased effectiveness, with the possibility of deploying Frontex experts for longer periods of time; thirdly, the creation of border guard teams; fourthly, the processing of personal data, which, besides being required for risk analyses, as Mr Busuttil has reminded us, must be regulated and fulfil specific conditions, and, these conditions must be provided for, specifically in terms of data retention and the depersonalisation of these data; and, finally, the creation of operational resources, or rather equipping Frontex with the means to acquire its own resources without having to depend directly on the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, it is a fact that improving Frontex was an important step. At the same time, the reform being put in place will help to improve Frontex operations. However, it would have been preferable to have achieved a better and more objective reform and, more to the point, a reform that would provide prospects for a solution to the major problems being encountered today.</p>
      <p sl="el">Be that as it may, the introduction of special teams of border guards in 2011 and, more importantly, the new position of fundamental rights officer to ensure that the fundamental rights that everyone wishes to claim on entering the European Union are indeed respected, are important arrangements and they have been achieved in this report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I trust that, for countries on the receiving end of large numbers of immigrants, such as Cyprus, which currently face demographic and economic problems, certain decisions will be taken, possibly within the framework of solidarity, to support efforts being made by countries such as Cyprus.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, the agreement that has finally been reached after months of wrangling will undoubtedly improve Frontex’s operations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We believe that strengthening the agency’s capabilities is, above all, a way of strengthening fundamental rights. On this issue, as on the other very serious issues that are rocking the European Union right now, it is time to give expression to European responsibility and to solidarity among the States. For too long, Frontex has been too vague about the information, conditions and criteria applied to people rescued at sea, and therefore, in fact, about the fate awaiting them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the States will be in charge from now on. This is one of the major breakthroughs of the regulation. However, the fact remains that thousands of people died at sea this summer in the Mediterranean, while battles – terribly hypocritical ones in many cases – were being fought between the States with regard to territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, following my visit to the island of Lampedusa and my meeting with the border officials manning that area and the people at the reception centre, this memory will be forever etched in my mind.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, much has been said about improvements in the human rights field, and it is true that there have been a number of improvements, such as the human rights officer, the consultative forum, the termination of operations in cases of human rights violations, more reports to the EP, and a few others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then again, the human rights officer will not be independent and the termination of operations will only happen in cases of severe human rights violations. Can somebody tell me where one draws the line between acceptable and unacceptable human rights violations? A few more reports to the European Parliament – which will not, by the way, be made public – will not give us greater control of Frontex.</p>
      <p sl="en">Additionally, there are also agreements and cooperation with third countries, with the possibility for Frontex to process data. All those things open new windows of opportunity for combating human rights violations. Much will depend on how things are implemented and on how the human rights officer will be employed. Will it be somebody with lots of knowledge and experience in the field and somebody with a strong will, or somebody who does not want to harm his employer? What rights will she/he have? What rights will the consultative forum have and what rights to information? How detailed will the Commission’s reports on monitoring the fate of returnees be?</p>
      <p sl="en">Much depends on how all this is done and on the consequences of all this reporting, etc., but you can be sure that we will continue to look very closely at how Frontex operates and at what the future developments will be. This new mandate solves nothing, and I would stress that I am deeply disappointed by the Council’s complete lack of commitment to human rights, which we witnessed during the negotiations. I really hope that there will be an improvement soon, and that these new small steps towards more human rights protection will be properly and fully implemented.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Arab Spring has once again highlighted the ineffectiveness and the weaknesses of current immigration arrangements across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our response needs to be two-pronged. Firstly, we need to radically reform the Schengen Agreement, not to prevent EU citizens from having free movement across the bloc – something that has generally proven very successful – but so that national governments are able to manage major specific migratory pressures on their borders, if and when necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we must also realise that, even if we do reform the Schengen Agreement, the EU’s borders will still not become hermetically sealed. That is why we must also tackle the issue at its source, which means giving Frontex the tools and resources that it needs to intercept migrants as they attempt to cross into the EU, and to deal with them appropriately. Political pressure should also be put on some of the countries which are particularly responsible – or should I say irresponsible – with regard to migratory flows to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Getting this right is in all our interests. My country, the UK, has, of course, not fully signed up to the Schengen Agreement yet. Many migrants who enter the EU will ultimately want to enter the United Kingdom, placing considerable pressures on humanitarian and local public services there and posing a threat to hauliers who pass through.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an issue that affects all of us, and we should all make an effort to tackle it, but we should do it jointly in a spirit of mutual cooperation, rather than effecting a spirit of confrontation, which we have unfortunately seen develop between Member States, and between Member States and the Commission, in recent months. That must be the way forward: reform, but also full understanding of the pressures which exist presently on our Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Frontex is a symbol: it symbolises the way in which the European Union wants its efforts to manage and control its borders to be perceived.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament has tried, once again, to exert pressure so that the fundamental rights of people who try to reach the European Union, for economic or humanitarian reasons, are better taken into account. A few of our amendments, particularly those concerning rescue at sea, have been included, for which I am grateful to our rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we are far from achieving the kinds of things we preach to the world. I shall cite just one example: rescue at sea. According to NGOs, since the start of the year, more than 2 000 migrants have been lost at sea. This summer, NATO ships finally reacted and rescued those who had been shipwrecked, but they searched in vain for a Member State to take them in. They returned them, once again, to Tunisia, the country in which the most effort has been made to support those who have fled the war in Libya, a war that was, nonetheless, backed by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We do not want this Europe, this ‘fortress Europe’ that lectures others about human rights and democracy, but which is incapable of reaching out to a few thousand refugees. Border control and expulsion to third countries without any real guarantee of respect for the most fundamental rights remain the key words. Worse still, explicit permission is being given for joint returns via charter aircraft. The issue of data protection has not been resolved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is currently conducting an inquiry into these deaths in the Mediterranean, and the European Union will have to account for its failings. There are still no cast-iron guarantees where human rights are concerned. Therefore, we shall not be voting for the mandate in its current state.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I support the proposals made to expand the mandate and competence of the border management agency. Support for border management is one of the EU’s key tasks, in which failure is simply not an option.</p>
      <p sl="fi">No one country is to blame for its own geographical position or the migratory pressure that it is under as a result. That is why it is only right to share this burden, and we must cooperate in the area of border control and assist one another, and, furthermore, do so in difficult times, and especially then. For example, it is estimated that there are more than a million illegal immigrants in Greece, which only aggravates the country’s difficult economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">More effective border management might sound harsh, but we have to remember that effective controls at external borders are vital for freedom of movement within the EU, and are one of the core issues of the entire European project. If the Union’s external borders leak, the pressure grows for Member States to increase the number of internal border checks that they conduct, and we cannot then blame national governments for any measures that they might take.</p>

I would therefore ask the Commissioner: when will you finally do what you have to do? How will you make a start in doing so? I call on you to ensure that the external borders of the EU are properly guarded. The citizens wonder where Frontex is, given that tens of thousands of North African fortune-seekers have entered the EU. They pass through these external borders without difficulty and then enter the asylum process or disappear into illegality.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would also ask the Commissioner: when will you tackle the corrupt State of Bulgaria? At the Bulgarian border, anyone can buy a one-way ticket to the EU without documents. Yes, Commissioner Malmström, I did say ‘buy’. The Dutch ambassador in Bulgaria has revealed that just a EUR 500 payment to corrupt customs officials will get you into the EU.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that this result regarding Frontex, an agency that very much expresses the solidarity and the sense of responsibility of the European people, represents, more than any other, a true victory, a victory for legal civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">We needed a stronger Frontex, Ms Malmström; we also need a new operational plan for Lampedusa and Pantelleria, which remain isolated while the inalienable rights of legal immigrants, which must be safeguarded, continue to be safeguarded and guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, there is a new form of Schengen governance that provides for integrated border management. This must take due account of the fact that citizens’ safety also depends on their having a good quality of life, which cannot always be guaranteed, and is still not guaranteed in some cases.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lampedusa and Pantelleria have so far received around 63 000 people from North Africa; cooperation with third countries is only right and it must be strengthened. I hope that the bilateral agreements, particularly the one with Libya, on which Ms Malmström has been doing some valuable work, but the rest of the agreements too, can finally be concluded: only in this way will they be able to tackle illegal migration as effectively as possible, and safeguard legal migration instead.</p>
      <p sl="it">Frontex’s efforts will have to be examined and assessed. More resources are needed, as is certification of the quality of the results achieved and a new operational plan. A revitalised Frontex, more human, practical and technical resources, and a new operational plan, are what we are calling for, just as we are calling for the fulfilment of the fundamental objective contained in paragraph 1 of this important text, which says that Europe must show necessary solidarity with countries facing an excessive or disproportionate flood of migrants, and not just pretend to be supportive as it has done until now, when it has sometimes forgotten.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would also like to acknowledge the work of our rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, and the proposal to amend the regulation establishing the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). This regulation has been supported by the work of the Commission and the Polish Presidency right at a time when we are focused on an agency that is based in Warsaw itself, and which is vital for understanding the significance of an area of freedom, security and justice for a globally relevant Europe, now that we are experiencing so many events – particularly in the Mediterranean region – that highlight the importance not of strengthening internal borders but of jointly defending and managing our external border. This can be done by strengthening the operational dimension of Frontex, its material and human resources, and the mandate that the Member States should contribute by fulfilling the solidarity clause; above all, however, we must strengthen its humanitarian dimension, in order to know who is responsible for off-shore operations, and underline the importance of saving lives and of responsibility in the area of disembarkation and first aid given to those rescued.</p>
      <p sl="es">This therefore sends out a positive message of commitment to the humanitarian dimension of Frontex and to the protection of vulnerable people and unaccompanied minors, and of respect for the rules of international humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Convention and the principle of non-refoulement.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore have an opportunity to highlight the external dimension of the European Union, its humanitarian nature, as well as its internal dimension, the mandate for solidarity, which is legally binding, positive law for all Member States based on Article 70 of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="it">The creation of a fundamental rights officer role within the Frontex Management Board and the requirement for Member States to show solidarity with each other are steps in that direction. The reform of Frontex must enable us to tackle the real migration-related emergencies in Europe. Only today, the Financial Times reports that approximately 85% of the 104 000 migrants who entered the EU illegally in 2010 arrived via Greece, and not via Italy or Malta, and unfortunately the same will be true in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="it">Only if Frontex fully respects migrants’ human rights and helps to prevent the huge number of deaths in the Mediterranean, which has now become a burial ground in which the lives and hopes of people fleeing poverty, oppression and desperation are extinguished, will we be able to say that we are on the right track. This must be Frontex’s goal, and the European Parliament will have to monitor the progress made in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, in the past, we have seen quite horrible images of refugees who had lost their lives gruesomely in the Mediterranean. The images showed women, children and young men, who had been trying to get over here to us in order to live a better life, but, above all, also seeking protection against violations of their human rights in their homelands.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposal on the table is for a better mandate for Frontex than the existing one. Unfortunately, however, it is half-hearted, it has gaps and it is not what we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance had envisaged, namely, a mandate that strongly protects refugees and human rights. There is, for example, the question of responsibility, which is to say who is responsible, ultimately? Is it the Member State, or is it Frontex? That has not been clarified precisely. What we fear is that, in future, we will continue to hear each party saying ‘no, no, it is not us, it’s the others’. This passing of the buck will, I fear, continue.</p>
      <p sl="de">What shape will cooperation with third countries take, specifically? What is the effect of us managing to get through a requirement for the legal situation in such States to be in accordance with EU law? There will clearly be no cooperation with dictators, but the detailed form of this requirement is likewise still unclear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we would also have liked there to be much stronger democratic control. For the European Parliament, in particular, there is still a lot to be desired in this area.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we constantly refer to the need for real solidarity between the Member States, in terms of our policies on immigration and in combating illegal immigration and in protecting human rights. We refer to security on the external borders, which is a prerequisite to the Schengen acquis, and, every time, we refer again and again to the concept of solidarity. The primary body for fostering this solidarity is Frontex, which is the subject of today’s debate.</p>
      <p sl="el">As well as congratulating our rapporteur, I should like to thank the Commission and the Council for the fact that, thanks to the negotiations which preceded this report, we have achieved a constructive agreement. These decisions prove that we are up to the job, that we are responding to needs, and that we are strengthening Frontex, all of which is sorely needed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to make two additional comments in connection with the future of Frontex and the need to promote it. The first concerns technical agreements with third countries. Commissioner, we have repeatedly debated, including here in plenary, the issue of the technical agreement with Turkey, which has dug its heels in and has stopped moving forward on non-technical issues. What will become of these agreements and what will happen now, following the changes in the Arab world and in North Africa?</p>
      <p sl="el">My second comment concerns the local branches which Frontex may decide to operate. The first branch has been set up in Piraeus. Based on reports we have received in Greece, it would appear that the presence of Frontex in Piraeus is vital in monitoring operations and supervising the situation there and, as such, it is important that it should remain following the forthcoming evaluation. May I remind you that, to date, the branch in Piraeus has operated on the basis of a pilot plan. Will the branch stay, if the evaluation considers it worthwhile? We also need to consider if other branches are needed in other countries.</p>

The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) has therefore been unable to respond to this humanitarian crisis, despite the fact that this situation has been going on for many months, and is not yet over.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that good intentions lie behind efforts to strengthen the operational and humanitarian dimensions and to establish a greater level of communitisation for this instrument.

      <p sl="es">This tragedy has an answer; it needs a stronger response from the EU, and there cannot be an effective system until those countries have established democracy and we have created a relationship of cooperation with those third countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Busuttil, for the outstanding work he has done. His deliberations have enriched the initial proposal, and we must congratulate him on that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">His report creates the blueprint for an agency with increased resources that are more appropriate to the tasks it is set. Recent events have shown us the need for closer cooperation between the European Union, the Member States and a strong agency that provides support. Frontex is finally being granted the resources to carry out its missions. By being able to purchase or lease its own equipment and by benefiting from the services of its own border guards, it will become more independent and very effective. It is also being entrusted with new tasks, such as organising voluntary returns and processing personal data, so that we can combat cross-border crime while protecting fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This extension of Frontex’s powers gives us the means to consider and deal with migration issues from a global perspective, without limiting ourselves to a mechanical approach to border management. I am in favour of the possibility of exchanging personal data with other European agencies, notably Europol.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the human dimension is very much a part of this report. Strong recognition of human rights is guaranteed by the proposal to set up a consultative forum within the agency. I can only welcome this comprehensive proposal, which will enable us to take a step forward towards the sound and responsible management of our external borders, at a time of particularly strong and sustained migratory pressure.</p>

There are many areas where I would have liked to have seen something better, for example, when it comes to independent observers. Yet whatever you may think of this new mandate, the situation will remain a patchwork.</p>
      <p sl="de">In all the criticism of Frontex – including the justified criticism – one point is often overlooked, and that is the participation and responsibility of the Member States in their collaboration with the agency. Unfortunately, they are not something that we can reform! It would be an important further step though, if we could finally, for example, put in place a uniform and improved European asylum system.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new Frontex mandate may be a step in the right direction, but critical follow-up continues to be absolutely necessary. The discussion about protecting our borders and about the rights of refugees will not be concluded simply as a result of this new mandate.</p>

Cofinancing is to be preferred to financing for joint operations as it remains the primary responsibility of Member States to deal with external borders.

One of the areas where Frontex experienced the most problems relates to the protection of fundamental rights and the guarantees ensuring the safety and protection of emigrants. I believe that the compromise text will produce significant improvements in this area. What matters most is that these new rules are applied properly. This is why Frontex’s actions need to be transparent to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also think it is important that Frontex will be tasked with carrying out risk analyses at external borders. At a practical level, these risk analyses will enable us to obtain accurate, objective data about the real problems prevalent in the Schengen area. This will help us avoid making subjective, strictly political assessments as is happening at the moment in the case of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, in the six years since it was founded, Frontex has faced numerous challenges due to waves of illegal immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia arriving in the Southern European countries, which are under disproportionate pressure and receive a disproportionate number of asylum applications and need real help. Today, however, Frontex needs a renewed mandate, more resources and funds and a better system for guarding the borders throughout the European Union, especially in Greece, Cyprus, Malta and Italy, with the use of border guards in accordance with the solidarity clause.</p>
      <p sl="el">In this new regulation, we support Frontex, so that it can guard the external borders of the European Union better, can oversee working agreements between the European Union and third countries, and can help with the voluntary repatriation of illegal immigrants, with due respect for human rights. However, in addition to strengthening Frontex, the European Union should, on the one hand, put pressure on Turkey to stop channelling illegal immigrants via Greece and via my occupied country, Cyprus, and, on the other, give real support to the countries of Southern Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Miller, Commissioner, I share the opinion of the rapporteur and the European Commission calling for Frontex’s operations to be based on the principle of solidarity, albeit a compulsory solidarity. Amongst other things, I am thinking here of the setting up of European border guard teams and the provision of technical resources by different Member States. It is also imperative for Frontex to work together with Europol, Eurojust and other agencies and to step up operations in countries whose asylum systems are not working correctly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summarising the agency’s work to date and in planning its operation in the future, we should bear in mind its responsibility to protect the Union’s external borders, but also its duty to uphold fundamental rights.

Finally, after lengthy negotiations, the Council has reached a common position on the strengthening of Frontex, which is an ultimately positive political signal after a period of national egotism and operational uncertainties that lasted too long.</p>
      <p sl="it">The creation of a pool of European border guards coordinated by the agency, a better definition of the rules of engagement for joint operations, the rescue of immigrants at sea and the strengthening of Frontex’s relationships with the other agencies are some of the most important measures envisaged by this agreement, but much still remains to be done: first and foremost, we must ensure that the European Union rather than individual coastal countries is now responsible for signing bilateral agreements with countries of origin, in order to carry out joint coastal patrols and curb migratory flows, right from the port of departure.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must then work with those countries and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to set up offices on the ground that will actually assess whether or not migrants have the right to claim asylum and hence to cross our borders. Much still remains to be done, but we are on the right track.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the Schengen area of free movement and the removal of internal borders has facilitated the free movement of citizens in an unprecedented way. At the same time, however, it also creates pressure for the better protection of our external borders.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It should be taken as read that the Union welcomes legal migrants and that it will also protect people fleeing oppression. At the same time, however, it is equally important to prevent the penetration of crime into our territory. The Frontex Agency has a very important role in this area. Despite some partial success, it has failed to achieve the desired effectiveness over the five years since it was set up. In the area of fundamental rights, the obligation to comply with fundamental rights under the Charter, and the obligation to comply with international agreements, including the Geneva Convention and commitments relating to the availability of international protection, have been enforced. Although posts and personnel for the area of fundamental rights and data protection have appeared in the institutional architecture of Frontex, there is nevertheless a whole range of deficiencies that we need to eliminate as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, one merit of the report is that it underlines the need for solidarity with the frontier countries of the EU. Better management is provided by strengthening the external borders of the EU through solidarity and trust, rather than by carving into those borders by denying access to Schengen.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main handicap of this instrument seems to be its total dependence on the means provided by the Member States when needed, making it a prisoner to their scarcity, political calculus or simply goodwill. Rather, to be fully operational, Frontex would need a minimal permanent capacity to intervene, like a rapid reaction force supplied by the Member States through rotation.</p>

At the same time, this will also mean that freedom of movement – borderless travel within the European Union – will continue to be secured while also making it possible to more effectively combat international organised crime such as human trafficking or drugs-based crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, there are three particularly significant factors. First of all, in future, we must have European border protection teams available – with top-quality experts and state-of-the-art technology instantly available. Secondly, we must at long last also call the Member States to account for failing to deliver what they had promised. In other words, staff and equipment that the Member States made assurances they would provide must actually be made available. Thirdly, allowance must be made for the possibility of carrying out risk analyses and providing the Member States with the data for effective border surveillance.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Frontex is a decision, a force and a phenomenon that makes very many people uneasy for several different reasons. This is the case, firstly, when it comes to solidarity with people outside Europe who want to seek a better future for themselves; secondly, with regard to respect for human rights, the Red Cross Conventions and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees; and, above all, there is confusion surrounding the traditional definition of refugee. Whenever we discuss Frontex, I think that we all have a huge responsibility to preserve the content of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the definition of refugee and the rights of refugees. The third area that causes concern is, of course, openness and transparency and respect for privacy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Lastly, I would like to stress how important it is for us to initiate talks with the North African transitional states in order to reach agreement with them as to how we should deal with these issues in the new situation that has arisen with the pro-democracy movements in North Africa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In supporting their democratic transition, we must devise, here in Europe, a true policy of hospitality that is consistent with our value of fraternity. Devising a policy of hospitality means, first of all, reviewing the reception conditions at our borders and ensuring that the fundamental rights of those who cross them are respected. It also means finding a solution for the thousands of young people who are dying in the Mediterranean, before our very eyes. This is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report, despite including new clauses on respect for human rights and fundamental rights in Frontex’s mandate, is not aimed at a new policy of hospitality. Despite the proposed changes, Frontex’s mandate is still confined to a repressive ‘fortress Europe’ attitude.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Frontex, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, has been subjected to frequent criticism since 2005 due to the less than clear mandate for its operations on the territory of Member States and its lack of resources for providing assistance to Member States in the event of exceptional situations on the external borders of the Union. It is therefore in our common interest to strengthen the resources of Frontex in the future so that it can be ready to respond effectively in situations where the border protection forces of individual Member States cannot handle an emergency situation on our common borders. In addition to staffing and technical reinforcements of the rapid intervention teams, we must also, in the interests of fighting cross-border crime, improve cooperation between the border authorities of the Member States and Frontex, as well as cooperation with the Europol and Eurojust agencies. I firmly believe that only well-coordinated cooperation between Member State border services and the relevant European institutions can contribute to strengthening our common border.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, along the southern maritime borders of our Union lies the eastern route across the Balkans, where illegal immigration takes place. This year, in my home country of Austria, we have already arrested more than 12 000 illegal immigrants, which is 23% more than last year. They are thus coming via the classical Balkan route, where there is clearly an open external border that seems to bear more resemblance to a Swiss cheese than to a real border.</p>
      <p sl="de">The activities of Frontex and Europol are failing as a result of the lack of willingness to coordinate on the part of the Member States. They are failing as a result of the lack of deployment plans and of technical operating resources. The negative consequences have to be borne, above all, by the central European countries of destination, including my home country of Austria.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this very fruitful debate. The amendment of the legal framework of Frontex has been a priority for us, and the developments in the Mediterranean have, of course, put even greater emphasis on this work. Frontex is only one player in the whole Mediterranean situation. This requires a whole range of different instruments. There is the mobility partnership that we are currently developing with our neighbours in northern Africa, starting with Tunisia and Egypt, and hopefully continuing with the new regime in Libya soon. There is also our global approach to migration, and we are, of course, putting into place the foundations of the common asylum system. I am grateful for the support of Parliament on all these issues and I am sure we will come back to them very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">But turning to the future of Frontex, the Commission will further assess the work of the agency and launch a study to determine if it is feasible to create a European system of border guards. The Commission will be making a declaration on this for inclusion in the record, and we will, of course, also be closely monitoring how Frontex is working under the new premises and regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that a first-reading agreement between the colegislators will enable the agency to better fulfil its coordinating role at the external borders of the EU in the coming years. It will strengthen its effectiveness and operability, and it will also strengthen the fundamental rights aspects of the work. I am thankful for the European Parliament’s support in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many expectations of Frontex. It cannot deliver on all these issues, but with the decision that will be taken in the vote here today or tomorrow, we will give it more resources, more guidelines, more commitment and better legitimacy.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, honourable Members, I have listened carefully, with interest and immense gratitude, to everyone who has spoken in this discussion. My impression is that we are all saying that a secure external border is a requirement for the permanent removal of internal borders. This is why we attach such importance to this discussion about an agency which, together with the Member States, guarantees the security of the European Union’s external border.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to express my sincere thanks in particular to the rapporteur. Mr Busuttil has shown that he is able, in what is a very difficult matter – and today’s discussion has shown again how difficult it is – to find a sensible compromise, a compromise which, in such an important matter for Europe, can lead to a settlement. It is not, of course, the best settlement for everyone, but it can gain the support of most MEPs. I am very sincerely grateful, too, for the work of the Hungarian Presidency and for their efforts on behalf of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The legislation you have prepared lays an even stronger obligation on the Member States to work together. This does not just mean working with the agency, but also with each other, in the name of European solidarity in terms of responsibility for the common external border. Furthermore, this applies not just to formal aspects, because working together also means the Member States making available their human resources, their equipment, their experience, and their ability in resolving the difficult situation at the external border.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The legislation you have prepared guarantees that Frontex will be more effective. We would not have been talking about the agency with such perseverance today if it were not for the real threat to maintenance of the security of the external border. In relation to this, the effectiveness we are talking about is not just a slogan; it is the profound expectation of European society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, in giving Frontex the duty of, as well as the tools necessary for, carrying out risk analysis, you are saying that it is necessary to prepare at the prevention stage and not wait until there is a real threat to the security of the external border.</p>

      <p sl="mt">First of all, I would like to thank all those who took part in this debate for their interventions. I think, Madam President, that if there is a lesson to be learnt from the events that took place this year – especially as regards the Schengen Area – it is what Minister Miller just said; namely, that in order to guarantee freedom of movement within the European Union for our citizens, we must realise that we have to work together to strengthen our external borders. This means that the freedom to move within the Schengen Area depends on strong external borders.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This is where Frontex comes in. Frontex helps us cooperate towards strong external borders. This is why we wanted to change our legislation; to make Frontex even more effective than it already is. At the end of the day, let us not forget that this is a chain, and – as the saying goes – a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. If there is a weak link, the whole chain will break. In the changes we made to Frontex, we kept one thing in mind: we must be strict in the protection of our external borders but, at the same time, we must be generous and show solidarity with those seeking help, especially people who are experiencing the realities of emigration.</p>
      <p sl="mt">To conclude, Madam President, I would like to say that it was a huge privilege for me to work together with the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Presidency – especially the Hungarian Presidency – on the subject of Frontex.</p>

      <p sl="en">The creation of a Frontex agency is effectively putting the determination of who may or may not enter Europe into the hands of the EU. Many countries in the EU have been inundated with immigrants, putting pressure on the economy and welfare systems and overcrowding cities and services. Once immigrants are granted access to Europe, they are able to travel between Member States. Many seek to move on to the UK, which already battles a ballooning population under the strain of recent immigration. At a time of fiscal crisis when austerity measures are essential, it is irrational to flood societies. What is more, the prerogative of who is granted asylum should be the privilege of the domestic government and not be determined by an outside agency. Whilst immigration for asylum seekers is something I support, I do not trust the European Union to be at the helm of decision making. In today’s global society, immigration may be used as a tactic by other countries. Mass immigration can distort social identity and threaten integration. It is a matter that should be handled with care and caution by leaders of nations who recognise and are sensitive to domestic peculiarities.</p>

One of the key elements in this is to make the citizens of Europe feel safe, and to ensure that they are able to safely make use of the most popular of our EU acquis, the Schengen system. The Schengen system, however, cannot function properly without effective protection of our external borders. European citizens therefore have an increasing need for an effective and well-organised EU institution capable of rapid response and which is invested with appropriate powers and capacities. That is why Frontex must be strengthened by legal means as well, so that it can indeed take effective action in the fight against human trafficking, criminal organisations and the drug trade. Respect for human rights, including those of refugees, must, of course, be an important consideration in Frontex operations. My fellow Member, Mr Busuttil, did an outstanding job with the consultations, both within Parliament and with the Commission and the Council, and for that he deserves our unmitigated praise. Furthermore, we must point out that it was the Hungarian Presidency whose efforts resulted in the fact that we reached an agreement on the Frontex proposal over the past six months.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with reference to Rule 177 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to propose to the House that we postpone the vote on the evaluation of EU counter-terrorism policies. Although the report was adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in July, it would seem that positions have been shifting in recent days and controversy has arisen over a number of issues. That is very unfortunate considering that the issue is very sensitive.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rapporteur, I worked on a timetable which would have allowed for a plenary vote before the summer break, but the timetable has been slipping. However, what counts in the end is the result; evaluation is a key element of transparency and accountability, and it is important that Parliament has a clear and consensual view of what evaluation should include. I believe that with a little more time, we may find circumstances more favourable to a common approach and be able to present a result that will command widespread support. I therefore ask the House to support postponement.</p>

    <intervention id="2-120-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">I welcome the President of Poland to the European Parliament with all the more pleasure because this is now his second visit to our Parliament. He made his first visit only a few days after being elected President in free elections.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, President Komorowski is, in fact, one of us. He was a Member of Parliament in Poland for many years, and served as Deputy Marshal and then Marshal of the Sejm. He also shares the system of values which we in the European Parliament consider to be of the greatest importance: the liberty of every individual, democracy and building a sound economy which has a human face. These are President Komorowski’s most important personal maxims and convictions.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the time when Poland was still not an independent country, he published and printed underground literature. He was also interned under martial law. Immediately after the liberation of Poland, he took up the first of a series of important functions in the state administration. He served as Undersecretary of State in several governments, and was also Minister for National Defence in the government which it was my privilege to lead. I should also add that President Komorowski and I are united by a friendship which is both political and personal.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, at a time of fears over demographic change in our continent, it is also worth mentioning that President Komorowski has resisted this and is the father of five children.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Of course, as you can see, this has not hindered him in his political career – all these things can be combined.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, we are very interested in what the President of Poland has to say, particularly because we are currently going through a period of difficulty. President Komorowski is the Head of State of the Member State which currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. It is in the interests of us all that we overcome our difficulties, and today we expect the Polish Presidency to send out good and constructive signals about solving Europe’s many problems.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, please take the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-121-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Bronisław Komorowski" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Republic of Poland">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the kind introduction from my former boss, my friend Jerzy Buzek. I should like to say that meeting you all is also a very moving experience for me. I recognise many people here in this Chamber, and not just, by the way, from among my Polish friends, because I can also see many people with whom I have worked on important matters, including matters which were important for Poland’s membership and for the membership of the entire region – of our part of Europe – in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to say – since Mr Buzek mentioned what I have done in the past – that for me, today’s meeting here in the European Parliament is something quite remarkable, if I go back in my mind to that most difficult of times, to the time when martial law was still in force in Poland, when I used to publish an underground magazine called ABC. The title came from the words Adriatyk, Bałtyk, Morze Czarne – the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. We strove to write and edit the magazine with the hope that someday – perhaps in the distant future – not just Poland but also the other countries of our region would be free and democratic countries, and that they would be able, too, to participate in processes from which my country and the entire region had been excluded for decades by the adverse decrees of history.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recalling that editorial work today, work which generally seemed to have no chance of success, is also important from the point of view of cultivating attitudes of optimism and an optimistic view of the world. Since one can move from an underground magazine, printed in secret – however, it was not a magazine devoted exclusively to its own, Polish problems, but to the problems of the entire region – to a meeting with the European Parliament in a situation in which Poland holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, this is a source, a renewed source, of political optimism regarding the future of our continent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, the history of Europe is a history of conflicts, a history of divisions, a history of feuds and wars. On the other hand, however, it also testifies to the irresistible aspiration of the nations which live there to achieve unity. Geographical, cultural, ethnic and linguistic divides have not prevented the people of our continent from building a united Europe. For we have come to understand that diversity is not a threat, but an opportunity and an asset.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first fully successful plan to unite Europe came from a small group of countries and was born out of the tragedy of war at a time when the continent was split by a sharp ideological divide. The Schuman Plan and the European Coal and Steel Community were a kind of Copernican revolution in Europe. For just as the great scholar, Nicolaus Copernicus, changed our understanding of the world, so the experience of integration has changed the way we look at international relations, and this has been the case throughout the continent. Europeans have finally become convinced that cooperation and integration allow us to build a better future beyond the divides that are the difficult legacy of history.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The price which had to be paid for peace, security and prosperity in Europe – the voluntary relinquishment of a degree of national sovereignty – has paid off as never before in history. The plan of the European Union’s founding fathers would not have succeeded, however, if it had not been for the bold ideas of everlasting peace and European federation developed by European intellectuals. The authors of these schemes include the Bohemian monarch, George of Poděbrady, French princes and clergy, German philosophers – Europeans of all confessions and languages. There were Poles among them, too, and – as is characteristic of our history – they also developed their plans for unity and peace in Europe in times which were the most difficult for Poland, because they were times when Poland did not feature on the map of Europe. They saw in a united Europe the chance for our nation to regain and consolidate its independence. One of them, Wojciech Jastrzębowski, wrote his Treatise on an Everlasting Alliance, which contained his Constitution for Europe, just after one of the bloody battles of the November Rising of 1831, as he dreamt of a Poland which was independent and secure. Today, we know that to build a united Europe, someone did, quite simply, have to come up with the idea in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, an important landmark in European integration – the real unification of Europe – was reached after 1989 and the fall of the Iron Curtain. The fall of Communism and the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe gave a new impetus to the integration of Europe. The Member States of the European Economic Community and its institutions – the European Commission and the European Parliament – undertook the difficult task of transforming the common market into the European Union, a Union in which the area included in the community was significantly enlarged. I will mention only three major projects, which, in my opinion, are symbols of that transformation: common foreign, security and defence policy, the Schengen area and economic and monetary union. At the same time, the Member States of the European Union have done something no less important and no less difficult, by which I mean they have carried out extensive enlargement. Integration of the East and West of the continent was possible and is still under way thanks to coordinated efforts on both sides of the boundary which once divided Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The great enlargement of 2004-2007 required a huge amount of work from all the governments, diplomats, parliaments and non-governmental organisations involved and from many other bodies too numerous to mention here. In preparing for membership, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe underwent great internal changes. In our part of Europe and in Poland, we had to cover the road from totalitarianism and a centrally controlled economy to democracy and the free market at high speed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This was done at a cost, and it was a painful cost, in the form of unemployment, a worsening of the political climate and a wave of populism. In Poland, however, it was possible to stabilise the political system and build an economic and financial system which proved its worth during the crisis of 2008 and 2009. We know from our own experience that having the courage to make changes quite simply pays dividends.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Poland’s transformation was the work of the Poles themselves, but its course was determined by the aspiration to be part of a Europe which was moving towards ever greater union, and Europe was of great help to us in this. The Europe to which history after 1945 had been more magnanimous extended solidarity – solidarity with the Europe which the decrees of history had made their victim. Poland has not forgotten that solidarity, and here in the European Parliament, a great deal is known about the help and solidarity of the European Union – Parliament was a champion of that solidarity then, and Parliament continues as the guardian of European solidarity today.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union is held, today, by Poland – a Poland which is dynamic, full of faith in the success of the European project, active in external relations and committed to strengthening the achievements of European integration. The Polish Presidency comes, however, at a difficult time for Europe, for its people and its economies. We currently face challenges more difficult than any we have faced in recent years. In most Member States of the European Union, we are dealing not just with a crisis of public finances and a crisis of fiscal policy, but also with weak economic growth. On top of that, there are Europe’s demographic problems, which have implications in areas ranging from economics to issues of civilisation and to politics.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The role of certain financial institutions in bringing about the present crisis, their growing autonomy and the detachment of financial markets from the real economy and the needs of society are undermining faith in the rationality of the free market. Many economic decisions which have serious social consequences are made outside of democratically elected parliaments and governments. The insufficient ability of governments and EU bodies to cope with the effects of the crisis is giving rise in places to a lack of faith in Europe, causing europessimism in society and increasing the tendency to taking unilateral action and to looking for solutions in isolation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, one of the most important achievements of European integration – the European social model – is being called into question. Its core, its essence, has always been a dynamic equilibrium between three values: freedom, justice and solidarity. It is precisely this model which has meant that life in Europe has been – and still is – considered to be the best for human society. This is why so many people from different parts of the world want to live in Europe, and want to get here by a variety of routes, often taking enormous personal risk.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union and its communities are at a turning point, at what is perhaps the most difficult moment since the beginning of the process of integration. The fight for the credibility and the future of the common currency is being carried on by way of hurried decisions establishing mechanisms for reacting to the crisis and improving the coordination of macroeconomic policies. Although my country is still outside the euro area, we do want to cooperate in the creation and implementation of plans to rectify the situation. We know that at stake is the future of a project which is of fundamental significance for Europe and its place in the world. The collapse of the euro and of economic and monetary union could be the prelude to reversing the process of integration, and this could have the worst possible consequences, including abandonment of the Union as a political project.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Some people are talking about – or hoping for – an inevitable return to the past, to attempts at domination and to nationalist attitudes, to the re-erection of borders as a consequence of the collapse of the common currency. In Poland, we do not even think about such scenarios.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">We do not entertain such thoughts, and are guided by our experience in Poland and the experience of the last generation, the Solidarity generation. We in Poland well know how easy it is to wipe out the civilisation and the achievements of many generations in the course of a few years. We have quite simply been there. The Union and each of its politicians need bold decisions, decisions as bold as those which, 60 years ago, began the process of European integration. Initially, not everyone understood the new character of the relation between sovereignty, on the one hand, and security and development, on the other. This is why the plan to establish the European Defence Community foundered. It is worth pointing out that the European Coal and Steel Community and, after it, the European Economic Community were not established with the involvement of all the countries which, at the time, could have participated. Later, however, they did join those communities, and are now participants in and beneficiaries of the process of integration.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must not remain idle in the face of external challenges and the problems which exist within the European Union. There are many things we have to change if we want to avoid social dissent on a scale far greater than that which we have seen in different countries in recent months or weeks as a reaction to problems of a mainly economic nature.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, the crisis is also part of the Polish experience. The crisis is not only a threat, but is also an opportunity to give a new impetus to the process of strengthening European integration; an opportunity to rethink and rebuild our common institutions, so that the Union can regain the capacity for further development and integration. This explains the programme of the Polish Presidency, in which our answer to the crisis is ‘more Europe’.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">French President Charles de Gaulle once compared the structure of a united Europe to the construction of a Gothic cathedral. Here, close as we are to the wonderful Strasbourg Cathedral, it should be noted and remembered that the Cathedral’s medieval builders did not know all the details of the building they were planning – they did not know what its final form would be. They did, however, know the objective of their work; they knew what purpose the building was to serve. It is my conviction that this kind of awareness, this kind of long-term perspective, is also necessitated by the situation today in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our objectives should be set by three related values: security, development and solidarity. New instruments have to ensure the European Union vitality, progress and international position. It is also essential to rigorously maintain the cohesion of the entire Union. This requires the open nature of the process of strengthening integration to be retained. The Polish Presidency will make every effort to finalise reform of economic governance in the European Union in the very near future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like, here, to thank the European Parliament for its extensive involvement and its valuable contribution to improving the measures which make up the six-pack, the aim of which is to strengthen the Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and to keep the public finances of the European Union’s Member States under control. I would also like to appeal for support for the Presidency’s efforts towards rapid adoption of the package, which is of fundamental significance for the economic stability of our European community.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">The success of the entire European project depends on its most advanced and ambitious parts. I am thinking principally here of the common currency, which, despite its present problems, is a great achievement. Increasingly often, proposals are being made to strengthen the process of European integration by basing it on the euro area. The facts of the situation, and this includes the reality of the crisis, have led to an openness to discussion on this matter. It should, however, be remembered that such profound changes – if they are not to harm the whole of the project we call ‘Europe’ – should be made by means of amendments to the Treaties. The need to obtain the consent of all the Member States most certainly raises the question and the expectation of ensuring that all Member States have the opportunity to be included in the process of increased integration once clear criteria have been met. It raises the question as to whether a suitable clear criterion should not simply be the possession of a healthy national economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do not consider the crisis of public finances to amount to the failure of the common currency, but we do have to try to find solutions which will allow its permanent stabilisation and make full use of its potential to create prosperity for Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The present crisis shows that strengthening the economic pillar of economic and monetary union is essential. We must coordinate economic policy better, and we should develop the emerging Euro+ Pact coordination platform, which involves not just the countries of the euro area, but also all the Member States outside the area which believe in the success of the common currency and are showing determination in seeking to adopt it. Strengthening coordination of the macroeconomic policies of the Member States has within it the potential for further political integration of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, the international situation calls for increased cooperation from the whole Union. No Member State of the European Union is able on its own to be effective in influencing the international order or new events or problems, nor is any Member State able on its own to bring external crises under control. In the face of the global challenges of our times in the area of security, climate protection or solving the world financial crisis, only a more strongly integrated Union has a chance of being effective in influencing others and deciding together with others about which measures are adopted.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">The present situation should become an impetus for strengthening European security and defence policy. The appropriate proposals have been put forward by the countries of the Weimar initiative. A great challenge for the European Union is the need to be skilful in pursuing policy towards its immediate surroundings. We have said a lot in recent months in Europe about helping the ‘Arab spring’. We remember 1989 and the famous ‘autumn of the nations’ or ‘autumn of the peoples’. So it is not necessary to convince anyone in Poland of the importance of the events in Africa and the Middle East and of the need to support the efforts being made for liberty in those countries. Attention must not, however, be focused only on the Southern Neighbourhood. We need a more serious approach from the European Union to its eastern neighbours than exists at present, for there is no conflict between the need for the European Union to be involved in supporting the countries which lie to the east and to the south of the Union. All of it is our neighbourhood.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">What is needed is a long-term policy towards the nations of Eastern Europe which have the prospect of membership, even if it is a distant one. We see this in the case of Ukraine, which, under difficult conditions, is making efforts to come closer to the Union in order to associate with it and – perhaps in the longer term – to be given the prospect of membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to convey my personal impressions of a conversation with the President of Ukraine – and they were difficult talks about difficult matters. I would like to express my profound conviction that there is great determination in Ukraine to achieve the conditions which are needed for closer relations and for participation in European integration. This also includes work to raise democratic standards there.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Eastern Partnership Summit, which will be held in Warsaw at the end of September, should lead to the formulation of a clearly written and ambitious political declaration. The partner nations to the east of Europe expect a clear signal from us as to what kind of partnership we want to build with them, how much we want to be involved in the realisation of their European aspirations, and how far we do not want borders to be obstacles to interpersonal contacts. How much are we really ready to work together to strengthen the common European identity based on common European roots?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, the great Polish poet, Zbigniew Herbert, once wrote something about the idea of Europe. He was an important figure for Poland’s Solidarity generation because he was a poet who spoke and wrote about freedom the way my generation, people of the Solidarity generation, felt about freedom and the importance of the struggle for freedom. Herbert wrote this: ‘The concept of Europe has always been changeable and imprecise for the simple reason that it is not the name of a continent surrounded by ocean and completely enclosed by its own borders. It does, however, evoke particular associations and, I venture to suppose, a faster beating of the heart’. Herbert wrote those words in 1973, when there was a deep divide across Europe that seemed to exclude nations just because they found themselves lying on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain – nations which had been a part of Europe for 1 000 years. I well remember the feeling of those times, the beating of the heart which accompanied timid dreams of freedom. Those timid dreams then became bold dreams of Poland’s participation in the development of a free world. I remember that beating of the heart, and I would like us still to feel emotionally bound to Europe, so that the very thought of Europe and its future still causes the heart to throb – not a fearful kind of throbbing, but the throbbing and the quickened pulse we experience when we take on new, bold challenges and make important decisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We in Poland believe deeply in Europe, and we want a European Union which is dynamic and bold, open and supportive. We want a Union which will ensure Europe a role in the world in keeping with the size of its civilisation, and a Union which will protect the vitality of that civilisation – European civilisation. We want a Union which will give all its nations security and which will be the right response to the needs and concerns of its citizens. We know that such a Union is possible. We want to build such a Union, and we want to do so together with the other nations of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, we would like to thank you for your words. You mentioned your work 30-40 years ago in connection with the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. Today, you have extended this with another very important sea in Europe, one which is of key significance – the Mediterranean. You referred to our Southern Partnership and the need to act in this direction. You said that diversity is not a threat, but can be an asset and a source of strength. We agree with you. You also spoke about the fact that Poland can be a source of optimism for our continent. We are very much counting on this. Both caution and courage are needed in what we do. Finally, I particularly noticed that you said: ‘Parliament continues as the guardian of European solidarity today’. Those words are very important for us. We are convinced that the European Parliament wants to participate and will participate in all efforts whose objective it is to strengthen our Union and bring about improvements in relation to the many problems which are still proving difficult to solve today. We – as the representatives of 500 million Europeans – accept responsibility for the work of our Union, work which has been so important for the whole of Europe for several decades.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the revision of the Frontex Regulation, which is the legal act regulating the surveillance of our external borders, is particularly important. Our common external borders are under pressure. In the spring, we saw our external borders in southern Europe come under extreme pressure.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is important to remember that Europe’s borders are common to us all. For that very reason, during the electoral campaign two years ago, we in the Danish Liberal Party emphasised strongly that it is important for all Member States to contribute to the surveillance of our common borders. Therefore, we are obviously happy that we have now succeeded in ensuring that this will actually happen in future, not simply because it is important to keep an electoral promise, but also, of course, because our external borders are what create the framework around the community that we are all a part of. It is therefore not merely a practical issue, but actually has a very strong symbolic significance as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the attributes of a common EU area of freedom, security and justice is that of the removal of borders within the Schengen area. This, however, has rendered the external borders of EU Member States a matter of common concern and has made the need for an integrated management of external borders through a coordinated approach ever more compelling.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, the adoption and implementation of common rules, increased cooperation between Member States, more combined effort and more pooling of resources are vital. Crucially, cooperation must be based on solidarity among Member States, especially with frontier Member States that, owing to their geographic or demographic situation, face severe migratory pressures, with one such example being Italy.</p>

I quote the chairman of our National Asset Management Agency, Frank Ryan, who controversially questioned the auditing role of accountants in the run-up to the collapse of banks which were transferring billions of bad and doubtful loans to an asset management agency. He said that it was hardly credible for auditors to say that it is not their responsibility to draw attention to significant risks that may become evident in the course of audits, such as, for instance, the extraordinary concentration of risk that developed at a number of Irish financial institutions between 2004 and 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">We certainly need to examine very carefully the role and the work of auditors and we will need to change the rules. I compliment Commissioner Barnier on his observations last night on the concentration of power in the hands of a very few audit companies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the very definition of insanity is to repeat the same action in the hope of different outcomes. In their response to the recent financial crisis, the EU’s leaders remind me of nothing so much as that scene in the Simpsons where Homer carries on electrocuting himself by repeatedly trying to snatch back his beer can from some electric cables.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem of the euro was excessive integration, trying to push countries with different needs into the same currency. So we have responded with more integration: fiscal and economic union. The problem was excessive debt, so we have given them more debt – forcing these loans on to people who cannot pay their existing liabilities. The problem was a bloated state at national level, so we have bloated the state further at European level, shovelling more and more of the medicine into the mouth of the patient who was sickened by it in the first place. In the process, we have sold our future to some pretty unpleasant autocracies around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Talking of an earlier run on the banks, my countryman Jonathan Swift wrote: ‘A baited banker thus desponds, from his own hand foresees his fall, they have his soul who have his bonds; ’tis like the writing on the wall’.

Unfortunately, at this point in time, we do not know whether we are at the beginning of the crisis, in the middle of it, or at the end. Obviously, the sooner it finishes the better, and there are, of course, lessons to be learned, in particular, in relation to the topic of auditing. My colleague, Mrs McGuinness, outlined the Irish view on that, and I concur with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the broader front, I want to welcome the speech by the Polish President, and I think we need more of that type of positive outlook so that – as he said – not only can we get over the crisis but we must also ensure permanent stability.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, older women are certainly at greater risk of poverty than men, and they are perhaps also more likely to be unemployed and have lower pension savings than men – as things stand, in any case, because everything indicates that women currently gain more education than men. It is therefore not certain that this situation will persist for much longer. As women live longer, there is probably also some truth in the claim that they are at greater risk of being on their own.</p>
      <p sl="da">These are indeed very real problems, but I simply do not understand why on earth the EU should get involved in them.</p>
      <p sl="da">The solution is not special arrangements for women, but providing general conditions on the labour market for everyone, so that everyone will find it easier to combine family and work and have the opportunity and incentive to work, and so that everyone will be required to save for their pension, thereby creating equal opportunities and equality. In reality, this is about equal opportunities.</p>

This issue is a problem for younger women, and indeed younger men, because we will need to have someone to look after us as we grow old, as will they when they grow old. For that very reason, if this report highlights the matter, it will have done a good job.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think that there are easy solutions. Society needs to have a very careful conversation about what we regard as our entitlements as we grow old and what society is willing to pay to allow us to have those entitlements. As we deal with austerity, that may be a very difficult debate, but this report will at least begin it.</p>

I found this a frightening figure because not only does it mean that women in this age group are significantly less well off than men; it has huge implications for their pensions. In other words, it means that they are more likely to suffer poverty in old age.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also talks about interruptions to the careers of women for caring duties, etc., and I would not like to think that I live in a society that acquiesces in the fact that when women take time off to care where it is needed, they are more likely to suffer poverty in old age.

Well, colleagues, the bad news is that it is not working terribly well.</p>

What could we do if we wanted our economy to grow? Well, the clue comes from the Commission’s own figures. When he was the Internal Market Commissioner, Günter Verheugen commissioned a study on the cost of complying with EU regulation, and he discovered that across the EU as a whole, it came to EUR 600 billion a year. Yet on the figures of the same European Commission, the advantages of the single market are worth EUR 120 billion a year. So, on the Commission’s own figures – and they should know if anybody does – the single market is five times as expensive in compliance costs as it is in benefits.</p>

There are also a lot of protectionist tendencies around the world. There is the question of conflict minerals.</p>
      <p sl="da">Therefore, the solution is not for the EU to establish a purchase mechanism. We have, in fact, tried that before and it was proven not to work. Through the World Trade Organisation, the G20 and bilateral connections, the EU and our External Action Service must put pressure on the countries concerned, with the aim of obtaining transparent and equal access. Once we have achieved that, we must ensure that it is the markets that decide – that we leave the rest to the markets. That is a far better solution than creating a purchase mechanism.</p>

The scarcity of resources, and particularly of rare ones, is a challenge for the European economy which requires a consistent and long-term policy. I agree, therefore, with the need to improve coordination of action with regard to exploration for and the extraction and distribution of raw materials. The question of recycling also continues to be important, as does the question of resource efficiency. There also appears to be an essential need for the development of more transparent and predictable framework conditions when giving regulatory approval for setting up new mines. The future of an industry-based European economy depends on broad access to both energy and non-energy raw materials. Therefore, there will be huge significance in the development of an innovative, focused action plan for raw materials governance which guarantees security of supply and increases the competitiveness of EU businesses.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, whilst debating the European Union raw materials strategy and trying to address the raw materials problem in Europe, we must first of all begin at home. It is generally recognised that waste is the most accessible source of raw materials. Unfortunately, although the average waste recycling rate in the European Union is growing steadily, in many Member States, a significant proportion of waste continues to go to landfill. Therefore, countries which, for many years, formed part of a planned economy zone and whose economies continue to rely primarily on manufacturing, processing or recycling, as opposed to innovations, might view this as a great opportunity. A greater focus on waste recycling and obtaining raw materials from waste would not only help address the EU raw materials problem, but would yield significant benefits for Member States’ economies. I therefore call on both the Commission and the Member States to take more vigorous action as regards obtaining raw materials from waste.</p>

They want to get access to raw materials at any cost, regardless of the devastating consequences which their extraction activities can have on indigenous communities, on the environment and on working class people. When I was in Kazakhstan, I saw the impact of mining multinational ArcelorMittal, which is guilty of grossly exploiting its workers and giving them no basic rights. The call for raw materials diplomacy is a very blatant appeal to use the European External Action Service in the service of these big business interests.</p>

Consequently, we are prospecting in areas where there are significant amounts of oil and gas, but where extraction is more expensive and more dangerous – the deep sea. The disaster last year in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrated that special care must be taken when planning, using and shutting down such wells. Therefore, this European Parliament document, laying down more stringent requirements for well operators and giving supervisory authorities more powers, is very timely. I am delighted that the report also reflects the amendments I submitted. There are a few points that we should focus on. First of all, pollution is of a trans-frontier nature. It is therefore important to apply equally strict requirements to projects in third countries (particularly those neighbouring the European Union), and to companies registered in third countries. We must also reach an agreement with third countries on compensation for environmental damage in the event of an accident within the jurisdiction of those third countries.

Some States offer more support than others, and the cultural differences in a woman’s role also influence the chances she will have to set up a business.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, we can at least say that it is difficult not to agree with the main concept of this report, namely that women can also be entrepreneurs. Of course they can. In fact, I know many female entrepreneurs, and they are very capable to boot. It is also hard not to agree that the Member States should adopt measures that make it easier to combine family life and work, and that the Member States, the Commission and we, too, here in Parliament, must improve the framework conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, why should that benefit female entrepreneurs in particular? Instead of indulging in a victim mentality, could we not simply say that we must ensure good framework conditions for everyone who wants to start their own business? Thus, each individual man and each individual woman can decide for themselves whether or not they want to be an entrepreneur.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am still here. Thank you for calling me. Can I use the opportunity to say, while we are focusing on the issue of women in enterprise, that the biggest problem for men and women in enterprise at the moment is credit availability. We have in Ireland the Credit Review Office, which is suggesting that while there is a problem with credit supply, there is also a problem with demand from enterprises, which are fearful of actually taking on extra debt.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to analyse more deeply what is happening. When businesses look for credit, they are not being refused, but the process is taking so long, and there are so many delays and so much bureaucracy involved in applying for loans, that very many of them literally do not push through the loan application. While, therefore, there is no official recognition that they have been refused credit, in effect, the process itself within the banks makes this a credit refusal, so I would require that we do further analysis of it, because if we do not have credit, neither men nor women can be entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if the recommendations in this report to promote female entrepreneurship are acted upon, it will be beneficial both for women and for our economies, because the numbers tell us that only one in ten women are entrepreneurs compared to one in four men.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight two particular issues. Firstly, the issue of social security: in my own country, and indeed many others, I am aware that if you are an entrepreneur and you go out of business, you do not have any social security entitlements, whereas those you have employed do. So it is no wonder that women, in particular, are cautious about setting up their own business. While I recognise and understand that this is a matter for Member States to deal with, I nonetheless think they need to look at this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to mention the Progress Microfinance Facility, which is also mentioned in the report. That can provide micro-credit of up to EUR 25 000 for SMEs and those who would not normally have access to credit from the banks. My own country has not accessed this fund, and I would call on this country, Ireland – and indeed all Member States – to make use of this fund to help struggling SMEs, both in starting up and in becoming sustainable.</p>

      <p sl="ga">One thing that would be interesting would be a survey to look at the banks and companies that went bust in the crisis and see how many women were in senior positions in those businesses. I would say few, if any.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is certainly no physical or psychological reason why more women should not be involved in business and entrepreneurship, whereas there might be such a reason in the case of other careers. It is quite obvious, as has been pointed out, that opportunities and encouragement must be provided to ensure this happens. Certainly one could say that, had Lehman Brothers been ‘Lehwoman Sisters’, we might not be in the situation we are in. So we have a lot to do: the resource is there; let women have the opportunity to contribute to entrepreneurship, SMEs, etc.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I voted against paragraph 46 of the report not on account of its substance, but because it contains legal irregularities. I am a great advocate of ensuring legal certainty in all matters. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not generally have management boards, nor do they have Member States as shareholders. We therefore need to be correct here. I am all in favour of the balanced representation of women in such bodies, but these bodies do actually have to exist.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the report overall. Self-employment among women is not an emergency solution; it is part of the economy and is an important economic factor. Women do indeed need particular support – especially when it comes to starting up a business – because they tend to approach things differently. They like to do things one step at a time and they want financing to be manageable. It is indeed a problem that when a person becomes self-employed, they then have to shoulder the full burden of their social security provision. In my view, therefore, we need to have an option which allows responsibility for one’s social security provision to be phased in; in other words, a way for people to take on responsibility for their own social security provision in stages. This would undoubtedly be another helpful step for women moving into self-employment.</p>

The institution of various proceedings against Mr Martin confirms the suspicions that have been floating around for a long time, yet which seem to have been deliberately covered up. For years now, we non-attached Members have been tabling parliamentary questions in an attempt to get to the bottom of the suspicions that Mr Martin has been negligent in his management of taxpayers’ money. However, we have had to wait for the ‘sorcerer’s apprentice’ – Martin Ehrenhauser, Mr Martin’s former assistant and now a Member of Parliament himself – to betray his former boss and bring these intrigues into the open. The extent to which he himself is tangled up in the matters requiring investigation also has yet to be established.</p>

On the other hand, the Union’s external borders will become an issue of joint responsibility, so there is an increasingly urgent need for their integrated management.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report aims for a coordinated approach to the security of external borders, as it is imperative to establish integrated and uniform management that ensures a high level of control and surveillance. Consequently, there is a need to go ahead with adopting and applying common rules, as well as to step up cooperation between Member States as regards securing their external borders. More combined effort is needed as is more pooling of resources. It is in the light of this need for more coordination and solidarity that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) plays an important role. Parliament has supported Frontex unequivocally, notably through significant budget increases to support its operations, as well as through demanding improvements in the legislation governing it, in order to address its shortcomings and improve its efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). The creation of the Schengen area in the EU and the removal of internal border controls have encouraged the EU Member States to address the issue of external border protection together, and the need for integrated border management is becoming increasingly important. In this area, it is crucial to ensure that the Frontex Agency, responsible for the protection of external borders, functions efficiently. Frontex should be the European external border agency that coordinates common EU action in relation to the external borders of EU Member States. In particular, Frontex should be ready to assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at external borders, especially those Member States facing specific and disproportionate pressures. I therefore welcome the amendments to the Frontex Regulation proposed in the resolution, and believe that they will strengthen the work of this agency, will help it function and meet its objectives more efficiently, and that, at the same time, the EU’s external borders will be better protected.</p>

      <p sl="it">I therefore support the proposal to amend the 2004 Frontex Regulation, since the security and management of our external borders must not remain an ambition, but must be guaranteed in practice by a body that performs its duties in close cooperation with other European agencies, specifically Europol and Eurojust, with the European Asylum Support Office and with the Fundamental Rights Agency.

Frontex reinforces security at the borders by ensuring the coordination of Member State action in applying Union measures relating to management of the external borders. The abolition of internal borders has facilitated the freedom of movement of citizens, requiring a coordinated approach to securing the external borders, which must remain closed to cross-border crime and other illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need to adopt and apply common rules, and to step up cooperation among Member States as regards the external borders. As such, this report, for which I voted, provides for the creation of ‘European border guard teams’, to be deployed during joint operations, rapid interventions and pilot projects. I would also stress the stepping up of Frontex’s obligations regarding fundamental rights, the establishment of an effective mechanism for monitoring respect for these rights in all its activities, the nomination of a fundamental rights officer and the creation of a consultative forum on this issue.</p>

We need to increase its visibility by deploying European border guard teams. The European Union must also improve its methods of monitoring respect for fundamental rights. This mechanism aside, if we genuinely want to help countries – particularly the countries of the South – then we must move towards harmonising the right to asylum, review the Dublin Convention and, even more importantly, finally draw up a proper immigration policy.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this proposal to amend the mandate of the European Agency for the protection of the external borders of the European Union, Frontex, which should make it possible to strengthen the work of this European Agency in a context of strong migratory pressure at our borders. An increase in European cooperation, as proposed in this act, will help improve the fight against illegal immigration on European soil. This new mandate is fully in line with the approach established by the European Pact on Asylum and Immigration signed by the European leaders under the French Presidency of the European Union in September 2008.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, which introduces some new rules. Since 2005, Frontex has been responsible for coordinating law enforcement at the external borders of the EU. The time had come to assess the first six years in order to strengthen it and make it more effective. I am delighted that the agency will no longer have to depend on funding from the Member States in order to purchase or lease equipment (vehicles, helicopters and so on). Furthermore, Member States are legally obliged to honour their commitments to provide the agency with human resources or equipment on an annual basis. I welcome the introduction of arrangements to ensure that migrants’ fundamental rights are respected, in particular, through the appointment of a fundamental rights officer and the development of a code of conduct. In accordance with international law, no migrant shall be disembarked in, or otherwise handed over to, the authorities of a country in which his or her life or freedoms are threatened. That may seem obvious but it sometimes bears repeating.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report as I regard the reform of Frontex as being of paramount importance, not only with a view to remedying the shortcomings in its operation identified so far, but also to granting it new powers and resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of the key aspects of this new regulation is the improvement in the agency’s protection of immigrants’ fundamental rights. From this perspective, the key aspects derive from the introduction of specific training courses for agents, the introduction of a code of conduct, as well as from the obligation on Frontex agents to comply with European regulations when conducting operations outside EU territory.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also regard the fact that Frontex will be tasked with carrying out risk analyses at external borders as an extremely important step forward, since these risk analyses will allow an objective evaluation to be made of the real problems prevalent in the Schengen states. Finally, I consider that the next logical step in Frontex’s development will have to be to create an EU border guard system, a measure which ought to be implemented without delay.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of the Council, which created the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). The Schengen Agreement, which made the free movement of people (500 million) and goods throughout the European Union possible by abolishing checks at the internal borders of signatory countries, was concluded on 14 June 1985. Control of the EU’s external borders has come to be a matter of common interest and to require integrated management. While freedom of movement is positive for citizens of good faith, it is also an opportunity for unwelcome individuals to enter Member States: for example, refugees, terrorists, criminals, fugitives from justice, stateless persons, etc. I welcome and am voting for this report aiming to strengthen Frontex by making it more efficient, by increasing its visibility through applying the name ‘European border guards’ to its employees, by binding the Member States to compliance with these rules, and by submitting it to more effective checks by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Schengen area of free movement brings together 25 countries (including three non-EU Member States), enabling free movement within the area for almost half a billion people across the continent. The removal of internal borders facilitates freedom of movement for citizens in a clearly positive way. It is, however, essential to coordinate the approach to securing external borders. The proper functioning of this system requires integrated management, ensuring a uniform and high level of checks and supervision. It requires the adoption and implementation of common rules and also greater cooperation between Member States in securing the external borders. The cooperation must, in principle, rest on solidarity between Member States, and particularly with the Member States on the borders, which, for geographical and demographic reasons, are exposed to substantial migration flows on their borders.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is here that the Frontex Agency plays an important role, responding to fast moving events in the area of migration flows on the external borders of the Union, and active in all common land, air and sea operations. It has not, however, reached the expected level of effectiveness. I firmly believe that the agency should embody European solidarity and that the resources collected from the various Member States should be combined in support of Member States in difficulty or in specific locations on the external borders of the Union that are sensitive or that require joint action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In an ideal world, each Member State would have ultimate responsibility for controlling its own borders and would take a sovereign decision on who is eligible to enter and reside on its territory, and under what conditions. This would not, moreover, preclude cooperation of any kind. However, Schengen and the European Union have been through that; they have done away with all checks at the EU’s internal borders and thus sent an extremely powerful message to would-be illegal immigrants. These people all know, in fact, that no matter where they enter the EU, they will easily be able to reach the country of their choice, particularly since the country of arrival will be swamped and its authorities overstretched. This is exactly what we have been experiencing since the beginning of the year, with the ‘Arab revolutions’ that, oddly enough, have offloaded onto the Italian and Maltese coasts tens of thousands of so-called refugees, whose primary duty is ostensibly to participate in the rebirth of their country. From that perspective, strengthening Frontex, the agency that is supposed to embody European solidarity in the event of a huge influx of migrants, seems logical. What is less so is the unhealthy preoccupation with considerations that, on the pretext of defending human rights, are liable to undo these efforts.</p>

The need for this review has become even more obvious in the light of the Arab revolutions and the migratory movements that have followed. I therefore welcome several of the proposed amendments, such as the establishment of a consultative forum, which will exercise greater control over Frontex’s activities, and the requirement for the agency to undertake rescue at sea during humanitarian emergencies, or face the suspension of its operations. The possibility that the agency will not have to depend any more on the Member States, by acquiring its equipment itself, together with the increased information given to Parliament, are amendments that will help to clarify the link between Frontex and political decisions. One aspect that has particularly caught my attention is the creation, thanks to this regulation, of the status of European border guards. This development, which is only terminological at present, is an innovation that may, we hope, have a bearing on other groups of professionals requiring the same coordination, such as the coastguards of the various Member States, for example.</p>

This week, the European Parliament adopted new rules on Frontex by 431 votes to 49, with 48 abstentions. This is the most significant reform of the law that established Frontex in 2004. Our assessment of the first six years of the agency’s activities shows that it needs to be strengthened and made more effective. From now on, the agency will purchase or lease its own equipment, such as vehicles or helicopters, and will therefore no longer be reliant on funding from the Member States. Personnel appointed by the Member States will help make up the European border guard teams. The existing ‘joint support teams’ and the ‘rapid border intervention teams’ will be merged under the name of ‘European border guards’.

The need for a European agency that is responsible for the effective surveillance of the EU’s external borders is now plain to see. We are experiencing strong migratory pressure. Given the recent developments in the Mediterranean basin, there was an urgent need to review Frontex’s operating procedures and working methods in order to give it the means to become fully operational. I am convinced that the appropriate response to phenomena on such a scale is a European response that respects the specific circumstances and needs of individual countries.

A recurring problem has been that Frontex is too dependent on Member States for the deployment of personnel and equipment in missions coordinated by the agency. Participation on the part of the Member States had been patchy, and pledges for equipment have been low. These shortcomings have seriously hampered the efficiency of the agency.

      <p sl="lt">I would like to thank Mr Busuttil for a well balanced report, and for helping us reach a consensus on how to strengthen the Frontex Agency. The principle of solidarity among countries has been consolidated, the European Parliament has become more involved and the dimension of respect for fundamental rights has been strengthened. This is important for obtaining public support and giving them confidence in this European institution. However, Frontex is not becoming a supranational institution – responsibility for border management and control lies with the Member States. Therefore, when carrying out operations, particularly in areas where the greatest problems arise, Frontex should involve national forces so that, following operations, the latter’s skills would be enhanced and they would continue to apply good practice. Before concluding working arrangements with third countries, it is important for there to be negotiations with EU institutions and those of the Member States in question which are responsible for external relations. Experience shows that undemocratic regimes may abuse judicial cooperation for political purposes. The EU must also pay attention to other dimensions of immigration. Undesirables should not cross the EU’s external borders. Of particular concern is the case where a Schengen visa was issued to a person suspected of war crimes, who possibly visited the EU several times. When he was arrested at Vienna airport under a European arrest warrant, the European arrest procedure was not followed and he was released.

The introduction of the ‘European border guard team’ concept enhances the European aspect of the missions and highlights the readiness for shared responsibility and integrated management of common borders.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This will help achieve European solidarity, highlighted in the Treaties, through the binding connection with Member States’ legal obligations and with sufficient finances and human resources.

The removal of internal borders, especially in the Schengen area, one of the objectives of a common area of freedom, security and justice within the EU, requires that Member States assume shared responsibility for the Union’s external borders. In this respect, it is vital to strengthen the integrated management of said borders; indeed, external borders must be secured by keeping them closed to cross-border crime and other illicit activities. Thus, the powers of Frontex must be reshaped and reinforced. I would like to highlight, with regard to the amendments made, the reinforcement of fundamental human rights provisions; the creation of an EU border guard system; support for Member States whose asylum systems are under particular pressure; the new role in assisting with voluntary returns; and the extension of democratic scrutiny on the part of the agency by giving Parliament a more important role in monitoring the work performed by the agency, including its working arrangements with third countries.</p>

The security of Europe’s borders has relevance even for those Member States who are not in the Schengen area. Europe must be protected against cross-border crime and other illegal activities, including the alarming problem of human trafficking facing the EU. A balance must be struck between ensuring borders remain open and efficient for citizens, legitimate travellers and people in need of protection and in ensuring that they remain closed to criminal elements. While it is important for Europe to have a common migration policy, it is equally important that we avoid the ‘easy’ rhetoric surrounding migration. Some Member States have been calling for the right to re-impose border controls in times of trouble. Such calls should be resisted, and the Schengen Agreement should be strengthened to ensure the continuation of the right to freedom of movement within Europe.</p>

This is a field that, with regard to the Schengen area, requires close cooperation as the nature of borders is two-sided: whilst they delimit the territorial area of a State, they also represent the outermost limit of a common area with an external border of 42 672 km, in which more than half a billion individuals move freely. It is with this key principle in mind – that the Member States must take joint action – that we should view the amendment to the regulation establishing Frontex: the aim is to endow it with effective means of action that enable it to provide timely assistance to Member States that need support through being the primary gateways to the European Union. Finally, the further strengthening of cooperation between Frontex and other Union agencies that share common goals is also justified, with a view to improving resource rationalisation and action efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, by addressing a recurring problem: the fact that Frontex is too dependent on Member States for the deployment of personnel and equipment. From now on, the agency will have the means to purchase or lease its own equipment, and Member States will be required to honour their commitments with regard to providing national border guards. This is about establishing a proper EU border guard system that can be tapped by the agency for all its operations.</p>

Indeed, given that freedom of movement is one of the greatest Community acquis, it must have as a corollary a high and uniform level of monitoring and control of these same EU borders. However, recent events have shown the need to review Frontex’s operating rules, in order to be able to cope either with a State’s failure to control its borders, or with exceptional circumstances. To my mind, sharing an internal market and an area of freedom, security and justice requires common rules. The survival of the Schengen area is therefore closely linked to the success of Frontex’s missions. Indeed, if the external borders of the Union become permeable, each State could well be exposed to threats. The fact is, any State that saw its fundamental interests or its security threatened would consequently have the right to take steps to maintain public order within its territory.

To this end, the Member States should be required to ensure that the agency receives adequate resources and equipment.

Since then, all international regimes for controlling exports have taken the decision to amend and update their own control lists.

      <p sl="pl">Dual-use items are the product of achievements in science and technology, fruits of the advance of civilisation. The idea behind the origin of such items is usually the aspiration to improve our quality of life, as is the case with chemical and medical products, or also, for example, to make everyday work and communication easier, as in the case of information technologies. However, if they are put to the wrong use, they can be a huge danger to health and life. Therefore, the control of exports of dual-use items from the European Union should be as thorough as possible, and the standards for maintaining this control should be equally high and rigorous in all Member States. Failure to carry out precise inspections and a lack of information on the final recipients and the final use of these items may result in a catastrophe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The rapporteur, Vital Moreira, has revealed the lack of democratic parliamentary control and the difficulties for the European Parliament to fulfil its capacity as a colegislative body in this field. The report reveals the prevailing practice whereby issues regarding the control of exports of dual-use items remain a closed area of intergovernmental policy, not even fully coordinated between the EU Member States, and the Commission only plays an intermediary role, while national parliaments and the European Parliament are excluded. I would like to stress that this area is part of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), which requires at least a minimum exchange of information between Member States. The issue of the timely exchange of information also covers the area of dual-use items and trade in military equipment. I remember a case, not long ago, when one of the big EU Member States concluded an agreement on the sale of naval transport, and recently equipment, to a third country. Other EU Member States were not informed of this in advance via the appropriate working bodies. Some countries have concerns that this technology may be used in an area of tension. I believe that the EU Member States must develop a clearer, responsible and principled policy on the export of military equipment and dual-use items. Consequently, there really is a need for a more in-depth review of related EU legislation, as proposed by the rapporteur, in order to strengthen CFSP coordination, the exchange of information, the development of a common EU position and its representation under international control regimes, and to increase the European Parliament’s role in terms of scrutiny under the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

Furthermore, this sector has a crucial role to play in developing innovations and promoting competitiveness. Consequently, we must make every effort to ensure that we create a more favourable environment for legitimate trade in these items and that we prevent their illegal use for military purposes or proliferation programmes. To achieve these goals, the list of dual-use items must be updated, taking into account advances in modern technology and the duties and obligations of Member States under international non-proliferation regimes, export control agreements and international treaties. As for European Union dual-use items, we must guarantee a more transparent and more democratic decision-making process. Parliament must be given more powers by tabling amendments to this regulation in order to enable it to fulfil its control function vis-à-vis the European Commission. The Commission must make every effort to ensure that secure systems for the collection, transmission and storage of notifications begin to work properly and it must regularly inform the European Parliament about the functioning of these systems.

Moreover, the European Commission is a founding member of the AG, and an observer of the NSG, but does not have any role in the WA and MTCR.

The achievement of this aim will not be possible, however, as long as a situation persists where there are numerous scattered provisions, repeated and often amended in terms of their essential scope, and in many legal acts, from the original legal act up to its most recent amendment, all of which requires an exhaustive search and the comparison of many legal acts in order to identify the positive law. The clarity and transparency of law therefore requires the frequent codification of amended legal acts.

I am therefore delighted that our Parliament has taken up this issue and is reaffirming the ‘polluter pays’ principle at this time. I feel that it is no longer possible to compromise when it comes to protecting our environment, our quality of life or our health. However, some of these projects are likely to have a real impact on the population, biodiversity and our living environment, and it is up to us to emphasise the precautionary principle and set up a suitable liability and compensation system.

      <p sl="it">Galileo is one of the crowning glories of Europe’s industrial and research system. I voted in favour of this report because, following convoluted negotiations with the Council, Mr Glante has managed to obtain a number of significant victories for the citizens of the European Union. I am referring, in particular, to the respect for privacy and data protection. At the same time, I am also referring to the desire to sell this technology’s marketable aspects in order to derive suitable benefit from the excellent work carried out each and every day by researchers, engineers and specialists in Europe, which has an ever increasing need for top-quality new technologies. With regard to the uses that this proposal deals with, I also particularly appreciated Mr Glante’s emphasis on security. This is of enormous importance and the European Union cannot tolerate missteps if we want to make further progress in developing high-quality technology.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I endorsed this proposal on the Galileo programme because, following this vote, the parties authorised by the Member States’ governments will be able, from 2014, to use data from the satellite navigation system in order to carry out emergency, defence and security operations. We can be pleased that the European governments will be less reliant on the US GPS system. European space policy is crucial to ensuring that Europe holds a strong position on the world stage. The European Union should therefore increase its commitment in this area, in particular, by providing European funding for flagship programmes such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Earth observation programme.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The aim of this report is to set out the ways in which the Member States, the Council, the Commission, Union agencies and international organisations can access the public regulated service (PRS) offered by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme. The PRS is a restricted service, to which the general public will not have access, and its use must be controlled for security reasons. The security objectives linked to PRS use are directly linked to the security of the Union and its Member States, and have an impact on the Union’s foreign policy. It is, therefore, essential to supervise users through means like the establishment of an authorisation procedure, the use of encryptions, the authorisation of receivers, etc. Furthermore, this is a service that uses some applications that could be very politically and strategically sensitive. All in all, the characteristics of the PRS necessitate a precise legislative definition of the detailed rules for access, which is exactly what is achieved with this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report on rules for access to the new services offered by the Galileo programme is an important part of ensuring service continuity and the security of the information provided by the satellite navigation system. We need to establish common criteria to regulate the usage, management and supervision of the information provided by the Galileo programme. The EU institutions must see the space policy as a priority, since it can play a vital part in cementing the European Union’s role as a leader in foreign and industrial policy. To further emphasise the importance of this sector, we need only recall a few figures: EUR 5.5 billion annual turnover, 2 000 enterprises and around 30 000 jobs. I therefore consider funding for space programmes such as Galileo to be absolutely essential, but here I should also like to emphasise that I am somewhat baffled over the exclusion from the EU budget 2014-2020 of the Global Monitoring Programme for Environment and Security.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Galileo programme, which plays a crucial role in the EU’s independence from other satellite navigation systems, offers the possibility of five services. This report concerns the public regulated service (PRS), which is intended for specific applications – such as internal and external security, emergency services, and critical infrastructure – for government-authorised users of the Member States. It puts forward a fairly detailed legal framework with regard to access to the PRS and the administration of users, to ensure the security of the system and of information. This regulation will only come into force in 2014. It establishes common minimum standards and security issues to be followed by PRS participants, which can be, in addition to the Member States, the Council, the Commission, and, in specific cases following an international agreement, European agencies, non-member countries and international organisations. I would stress that it is important to set out clear rules in relation to access and to the event of non-compliance, since PRS information is naturally very sensitive at political and strategic level for Member States, and can be used in emergency situations. The inclusion of the directive on data protection and privacy is another point that it is important to stress.</p>

The European Union and the Swiss Confederation are aiming towards the mutual recognition of Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) in order to improve bilateral trade conditions, promote quality in the food chain and preserve the value of sustainable rural development.

Lately, I have been looking very closely at how integrated Switzerland is within the European economy and how much it interacts with its neighbouring countries. I have had the opportunity to have first-hand contact with a country that is generally European in its values and approach to the market, even though at times, it tends to trade on much-vaunted differences. Hence, this decision by the Council represents due acknowledgement of a process of integration which, in truth, has been going on for centuries. The problem that I have found is the views held by a section of the population with regard to the free movement of workers, yet I am delighted to say that the EU is doing its part to facilitate commercial exchanges, so Switzerland must respond with conciliatory measures showing its desire to pursue the four freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this proposal because it provides for additional full liberalisation which will apply to approximately 20% of the EU’s exports to Norway and will represent roughly EUR 250 million. In total, some 60% (in terms of trade value) of agricultural trade between the Kingdom of Norway and the European Union will be completely free. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy products, fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants, Norway will grant some tariff quotas or tariff reductions. The concessions granted by the EU to Norway also include full liberalisation on products on which Norway offers full liberalisation, and additional tariff quotas for cheese, fresh raspberries, potato crisps and pet food. The agreement takes into account the sensitive nature of certain products important for agricultural production in both the EU as well as Norway and provides for appropriate arrangements on tariff quotas or tariffs reductions; these tariffs will also be important for agricultural production in the medium and long term, given the conditions anticipated under the reforms of the common agricultural policy after 2013. Although Norway enjoys a positive total trade balance with the EU, the agricultural trade balance is in the EU’s favour. Between 2000 and 2007, EU exports of agricultural products doubled and account for EUR 1.6 billion. However, the agreement will have budgetary implications; the loss in customs revenues is estimated at approximately EUR 4.96 million (net amount after deduction of collection costs).</p>

Fishing activity in the South Pacific has, until now, been managed by the two Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs): the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention (IATTC) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). Since the objective of both is to manage highly migratory species, the fishing of other types of resources in this vast area has been unregulated, other than in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of coastal states that applied their own rules. To fill this gap, and given that there is fishing activity both in the EEZ and in the high seas, in 2006, the governments of Australia, Chile and New Zealand decided to launch a process of international consultations on the establishment of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO), with the aim of cooperating to address the gap in the management and conservation of non-highly migratory species and the protection of biodiversity in the high seas areas of the South Pacific, in a manner consistent with international law and following best practice. The EU has taken part in this process from the outset and has made some important achievements, and we must therefore now create the conditions for the EU to ratify the convention and work actively in all fora, both international and bilateral, and call on countries with fishing fleets in the region covered by the convention to sign, ratify and implement it in order to speed up its entry into force.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Like other regions of the world, the South Pacific Ocean did not have a convention on the conservation and management of its high seas fishery resources. Represented by the Commission, the Union participated in negotiations aiming to change this state of affairs and, since July 2010, it has been a signatory of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite the step taken by the European Union and the importance of the issue underlying that instrument of international law, the majority of states involved seem reluctant to definitively commit. The delay in ratifying the convention by important countries, whose good practices and fishing tradition would make it possible to foresee another way, weakens the agreement that has been reached and threatens its actual implementation. I hope that this situation will be reversed and that the convention can come into force, so as to ensure sustainability and proper management of fishery resources in the South Pacific. Like the rapporteur, I believe the Union should be a party to the majority of conventions of this sort, so as to seek to ensure respect for its interests, the defence of the conservation of species and the adoption of best practices by other actors.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation, drafted by Ms Fraga Estévez, is the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean. Fishing activity in the South Pacific Ocean is managed by two international organisations: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, whose activities cover highly migratory species. To fill this gap and ensure the protection of biodiversity, the countries of the region – Australia, Chile and New Zealand – are carrying out consultations on the creation of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation. Although EU vessels do not make significant catches, the parties need to ratify the convention concluded by the EU on 26 July 2010, in line with the Council decision of 24 July 2010.

      <p sl="pt">Once again, we would stress the importance of multilateral cooperation in the area of promoting the proper preservation and management of marine biological resources, which is the subject of this report. We believe both coordination and cooperation are important in the management of shared bodies of water – seas and oceans – so as to guarantee the sustainability of fishing activity, and the interests of the people and communities dependent on them, whilst ensuring, at the same time, that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is combated. For these reasons, we welcome the creation of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO), whose goal is to establish cooperation, at international level, in the areas of conserving and managing fisheries for non-highly migratory species, and of protecting biodiversity in the marine environment in the high seas areas of the South Pacific Ocean, in a manner consistent with international law and best practices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that the fishing fleets of various Member States are currently present in the South Pacific Ocean, the conclusion of the Convention to establish the SPRFMO is positive. Given that other countries have not yet concluded the convention, appropriate efforts need to be made to address their concerns and seek to strengthen multilateral cooperation on the foregoing objectives.</p>

Approximating these systems would enable the importing authority to issue its own certificate for the aeronautical product, part or appliance without duplicating all the assessments done by the exporting authority. The European Union aeronautical product certification system is fully taken into account in the text of the draft agreement between the EU and Brazil that has been drawn up, in which aeronautical product and part certification tasks are clearly separated from the activities of organisations involved in the design and manufacture of these products and their parts.

It is based on mutual trust in the systems of the other party, and on a comparison of regulatory differences. The agreement is of great benefit to both European and Brazilian companies, as it will save millions of euro a year thanks to less costly product approval procedures and the mutual recognition of certification findings.

This agreement is therefore an important step towards opening up the market to airlines from the EU and Brazil, without any discrimination.

This waiver, as framed by Article 3(4) of the agreement, creates the possibility of arrest and surrender for practices that do not constitute a crime in both countries concerned. A case in point is the possibility of waiving double verification of criminality concerning the ‘facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence’.</p>

In order to speed up the development of electric vehicles in the European Union and thus reduce CO2 emissions, it is important for this type of transport to be as attractive as possible to consumers. At present, bulky fuel cells, which increase vehicle mass and do not guarantee sufficient range before recharging, are one of the main obstacles to this.

This report calls on the Commission to ensure that competitive conditions on the auditing market are such as to enable small businesses to have access to it.

I agree that discussions must be held at EU level on strengthening the role of the audit committees of all financial institutions, and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) urgently need to be adopted because this would make it possible to harmonise audits at European level and facilitate the task of supervisory bodies.

The European Parliament welcomes the Green Paper on auditing announced by the European Commission, but calls on the Commission to look into how the role of the auditor might be extended to include audits of risk reports provided by the entity being audited, in addition to verification of the information supplied in the main financial statements. Furthermore, Parliament suggests that the Commission urgently adopt the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), which would make it possible to harmonise audits at European level and facilitate the task of supervisory bodies. Given that it is essential to preserve the independence of the auditor, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to investigate the use of restrictive covenants by banks and other financial institutions on loans and other financial products for companies, which may be limiting auditor choice. Furthermore, Parliament proposes that the Commission should look into creating a quality certificate and register for audit companies, so that small and medium-sized audit firms can show that their work is of a satisfactory standard.

      <p sl="sk">The measures adopted both in Europe and elsewhere in the direct aftermath of the financial crisis have focused on the urgent need to stabilise the financial system. While the role played by banks, hedge funds, rating agencies, supervisors or central banks has been questioned and analysed in depth in many instances, limited attention has been given so far to how the audit function could be enhanced in order to contribute to increased financial stability. The fact that numerous banks revealed huge losses from 2007 to 2009 on the positions they had held both on and off balance sheet raises the question not only of how auditors could give clean audit reports to their clients for those periods, but also about the suitability and adequacy of the current legislative framework. It thus seems appropriate that both the role of the audit and its scope are further discussed and scrutinised in the general context of financial market regulatory reform. In this context, it is important to stress that auditors have an important role to play and are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This entrustment responds to the fulfilment of a societal role in offering an opinion on the truth and fairness of the financial statements of audited entities.

      <p sl="en">I am voting in favour of the Masip Hidalgo report on audit policy which calls for an in-depth debate on the function of auditors and the structure of the audit market, coupled with a detailed impact assessment which will analyse the various options for future auditing regulations. The response to the recent financial crisis has mainly focused on restoring stability to our financial institutions, but the role of auditors in the crisis is less well understood. In the past, the proliferation of large firms offering multiple professional services has led to dangerous conflicts of interest and high concentrations of risk. More fundamentally, the failure of audit firms to draw attention to the excessive risk taking and instability of many financial institutions played a large role in precipitating the current crisis, causing many people to lose their jobs and stifling access to credit. We must address these problems by ensuring that auditors act in the public interest, and encouraging growth and broadening of expertise amongst smaller auditing firms. This type of transparent, better regulated auditing will play a key role in restoring economic stability and confidence that companies are financially healthy.</p>

While it is positive that the report addresses part of those problems, it nevertheless bases its answer on the free market system and does not take into account what happened with the current crisis.

Systemically important financial operators have shown inadequate risk management and control systems, and lessons need to be drawn on auditing policy and practice. Properly empowered audit committees and good-quality external auditing are cornerstones of economic stability, easy access to financing as well as market confidence in the accuracy of financial and risk reports. When auditing firms provide a company with services other than gauging its financial shape, conflicts of interest are liable to arise, compounding the fact that auditors are paid by the audited firm. Hence the importance of international standards on auditing, as well as ensuring good governance practices. Auditor independence is key to accurate financial reporting and we need to reflect upon the implications of unwarranted intimacy between auditors and the scrutinised companies, especially in a field dominated by four main providers. We need to consider the feasibility and impact of solutions such as external rotations, voluntary joint auditing undertakings. Moreover, a clear regulatory environment and standards can help smaller auditors thrive and diversify this area of public interest.</p>

Furthermore, women are more likely to have slower, shorter and/or interrupted careers due to maternity leave, or having to care for elderly relatives or disabled family members, and lower average earnings than men, because there is still a gap between what men and women are paid for the same jobs, and consequently, women receive smaller pensions, increasing their risk of poverty in old age.

It is crucial to promote policies that encourage active ageing and specific measures in the pensions sector, so as to ensure that women will have adequate incomes when they retire. Indeed, economic independence is a prerequisite for individuals to be able to exercise control over their own lives and to make genuine choices. More robust economic and social policies need to be developed and equipped with the mechanisms necessary for adequately managing the ageing process of the population and the inevitable changes that occur in society.</p>

This situation will end up benefiting all parties concerned: not only will women certainly be able to satisfy their working ambitions; society itself will also benefit from women’s contribution in the workplace, which is as precious as it is sometimes underutilised. This is not a matter of subverting biology or demanding that women prioritise their career over their family.

The average European employment rate for women aged between 55-64 years is 37.8%, compared with 54.8% for men in the same age bracket. In some 21 Member States, the unemployment rate is higher for women than men. Indeed, the rate of part-time work is four times higher among women than among men (37%:12%). Furthermore, the gender pay gap is much higher at the end of women’s careers. Age discrimination against women over 50 is also reported much more frequently than in other age groups. Older men tend to remain outside the labour market mainly because of retirement, whereas with women, family responsibilities are the primary cause. However, older women still represent an important contribution to society in that they help care for their children and their grandchildren.</p>

It is therefore necessary to put a stop to the causes of this discrimination, as studies show that women aged over 60 are more likely to be exposed to social exclusion, since their pensions are lower than those of men who have worked and contributed for longer.

The fear that the older generation is becoming a heavy burden on younger and working-age people is justified.

The situation of these women in the labour market is much less favourable than that of men of the same age, which often results in their taking early retirement. Ensuring that older women have better access to education and care as well as finding a solution to the problem of the negative perception of their opportunities in the labour market could greatly increase the numbers of these women in employment. Many options could be examined to avoid the situation in which older women who have given up paid employment in order to provide unpaid care suffer the consequences in the form of reduced pensions. I am also pleased to see that the document considers the problem of women acting as carers. In a situation where many thousands of Polish women are working illegally in this field in other countries of the EU, or have given up their jobs and are working unpaid at home in this area, action to prevent their future poverty and social exclusion is essential.</p>

Older employees are, above all, a vast source of knowledge and experience and, in addition, they themselves find great satisfaction in being employed, because they can feel appreciated and needed.

The economic crisis that struck the EU has also hit SMEs, and has affected working women in particular. We are seeing a social imbalance in SMEs. Only one in ten women are ready to become entrepreneurs, while men are more than twice as active. Special attention must therefore be paid to women by establishing networks called ‘embassies’, as is being done in 22 EU Member States. Here, women pass on their experience and inspire others to set up their own business. We must encourage women by means of various financial instruments, such as microfinance and money from the EU Structural Funds. The EU Member States could constantly share examples of best practice of how to help women become more entrepreneurial. A third of new companies in the EU are established by unemployed people, and women often have the required education. All they lack is self-confidence.

      <p sl="pt">Women comprise 50% of the population of the EU countries, and are therefore a significant sector of the workforce. Furthermore, Europe has the highest proportion of older women in the world. One of the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and promote employment by increasing the rate of employment to 75% and reducing the number of people in poverty by 20 million. In order to achieve this objective, the situation of older women needs to be assessed. In fact, older women face at least a twofold discrimination in the labour market based on gender and age, combined with their greater vulnerability in the labour market caused by women-specific work trajectories. There is a need to combat these stigmas with inclusive policies. I believe that proper management of the population’s ageing process and the inevitable changes in society will certainly contribute to sounder economic and social policy. As such, I voted for this report, which presents an analysis and concludes with the need to integrate a gender and age dimension into all active ageing strategies at all levels of governance.</p>

Moreover, the gender pay gap, career interruptions for maternity leave or to provide care, part-time work, and lower remuneration, which characterises women’s jobs, lead them to be subjected to multiple types of discrimination in old age, when their ability to have an active life and their pension rights are already reduced. As such, there is a need to come up with a systematic, comprehensive approach to active labour market policies, in particular, providing for special measures relating to health and workplace safety, accompanied by a strategy that explicitly includes the principle of gender equality.

      <p sl="en">Older women face discrimination in the labour market based on both their gender and age. This, combined with other factors, increases their vulnerability to poverty in their old age. Shorter or interrupted careers due to childbirth or caring for others and a persistent and significant gender pay gap, which only increases with age, also contribute to this fact. As family caregivers, women often take more flexible jobs that come with lower wages and few, if any, benefits. Frequent job changes also make it harder to qualify for decent pensions. The occurrence of part-time work is four times higher among women than men All of these factors combine and have a huge impact on women’s ability to accumulate pension entitlements for their old age. Additionally, women live longer, which makes them especially vulnerable during retirement. They outlive their husbands due to a higher life expectancy. Living for longer, and with less pension entitlements, means older women are at a greater risk of poverty than men. More must be done to address these issues and to ensure that women are protected from discrimination both during their working lives and on into their retirement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The situation of older women is worrying from a socio-economic point of view. Indeed, major inequalities between men and women persist in many areas; they have a strong impact on women’s employment and, at the same time, on their pensions and, hence, on their incomes. This situation is all the more worrying given our ageing population in Europe: estimates today put the rate of informal carers of elderly people at 80%; these carers are very often women, who have to partially or completely give up their jobs in order to help their dependents even though they are already at a disadvantage in the labour market. As Europe’s population ages, it is highly likely that there will be a proportional increase in the percentage of this unpaid work, thereby affecting these older women’s pensions. The European Union must take measures to promote their work-life balance and so reduce their risk of poverty. Suitable support structures must therefore be put in place, and I welcome the work that Ms Bauer has done to achieve this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on the situation of women approaching retirement age. Age is currently the most common reason for not being given a job. Graduates are too young and do not have the experience, and the rest of society is, for the most part, too old. The situation is, indeed, particularly difficult for older people. In the Polish labour market, people approaching the age of 50 have limited chances of finding employment. At the end of December 2009, there were 391 672 people over 50 registered in Polish employment offices. This represents 20.7% of all unemployed people. Older women are in a particularly difficult situation. This group is characterised by its low participation in employment. Over half of women who are approaching retirement age remain outside the labour market. Considering the fact that in 2020, people over 60 will make up over 26% of society, getting older people back into work is a key task as part of action to help groups which suffer discrimination in employment to participate more fully in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, I want, in particular, to draw attention to paragraph 10 of the report, in which Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to create conditions for older women to remain in and/or return to the labour market, to help them use their potential in the labour market, and to ensure that their rights are respected. It is also necessary to implement measures that encourage employers to improve their equal opportunities policies so that ageist attitudes towards older women are tackled.</p>

That is why the Member States should genuinely integrate gender equality in the preparation and implementation of pension reforms.

      <p sl="lt">Currently, this issue is very relevant to Lithuania because my country recently raised the age of retirement to 65. Under new legislation, the retirement age for Lithuanian women will increase by four months every year until 2026. Women play an active part in Lithuania’s labour market. The female employment rate in Lithuania (61%) exceeds the average of the EU 27 by 2%. Even before the increase in the retirement age, the number of working women aged 60-69 was rather high. According to official statistics, the rate of female employment among women aged 60-64 is 29.3%. We must protect women over 50 against age and gender discrimination. The rapporteur reminds us that, in old age, the gender pay gap is much greater than it is at the start of a career.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We also need to address the issue of work-life balance and the lack of flexible employment opportunities. In Lithuania, in the majority of cases, earnings when working part-time are insufficient to guarantee a decent standard of living – compared with the EU average (31.5%), only 9.5% of Lithuanian women work part-time.

Women have different priorities to men when it comes to making choices between life and work. The result is that women and men have a different work rhythm. A fair-minded policy must take account of this. We want young women to have more children. We are concerned about labour shortages. When women claim their statutory maternity leave, however, they are punished for it. It is a paradox – we ask women to have more babies, but we are unwilling to acknowledge their contribution. As a result, many women fall into poverty in old age, as a direct consequence of this injustice. Taking account of the lifecycle opens the way to a fair solution for women and mothers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Parliament’s plenary has today adopted the own-initiative report on the implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters. The directive assumes the introduction of a mediation procedure covering a broad spectrum of dispute resolution. The mediation process envisaged by the directive involves the amicable, extra-judicial resolution of disputes between parties, with suspension of limitation and prescription periods during mediation procedures. It therefore does not limit the right to judicial dispute resolution, but rather encourages parties to resolve disputes through a mediation procedure. It can be seen that where countries have introduced mediation procedures, there has been a sharp decline in judicial disputes. The report adopted by Parliament unfortunately reveals that the Czech Republic, together with Austria, Finland and Sweden, has not yet incorporated the directive into law, which is very odd, particularly in view of the Czech Government’s much vaunted effort to speed up judicial procedures. The backlog of civil disputes in Czech courts is alarming. The report states that in Italy, Romania and Bulgaria in particular, the introduction of a mediation procedure under this directive has brought about a sharp reduction in the number of judicial disputes, and in Bulgaria, for example, up to one third of all disputes are resolved in mediation procedures. I voted in favour of the report, with the intention of appealing to the Czech Government to begin work rapidly on the harmonisation of Czech law and the introduction of the mediation procedure, particularly in light of the very positive experience with mediation in other Member States.</p>

Access to justice should include access to adequate dispute resolution processes for individuals and businesses. The objective of Directive 2008/52/EC is to promote the amicable settlement of disputes by encouraging the use of mediation and by ensuring a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings. In order to facilitate access to mediation as a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach and to ensure that parties having recourse to mediation in the European Union benefit from predictable framework legislation, the directive introduces common principles addressing, in particular, aspects of civil procedure.

We cannot ignore the fact that the solutions found by mediation often result from the parties working together, so they achieve results that are accepted better by both parties or in which both parties consider themselves the winner, which could never happen with a court judgment. There is obviously still a long way to go on this matter, not least as regards the Member States that still have not implemented the directive but, even with respect to those that have already done so, there should be greater understanding of the use of mediation, not least as regards access by small and medium-sized enterprises.

I share the belief that it is necessary to increase the processes that aim to raise awareness of mediation, and the demand for measures that help to increase the utilisation of mediation.

Without sufficient court funding and without adequately qualified judges (particularly when resolving specific cases requiring special expertise), the length of hearings increases and quality deteriorates, while citizens’ opinions of the system also continue to deteriorate. The mediation process, which helps to solve the problems mentioned, has long been known as an alternative to the judicial investigation of disputes. Unfortunately, due to various procedural problems, the rules regulating the mediation process vary in different Member States. We should therefore welcome this decision, which makes procedures for the extrajudicial investigation of disputes more attractive for EU society.

      <p sl="fr">In May 2008, the European Union adopted a directive on mediation which had been under way since 2004. Its aim: to promote the amicable settlement of disputes and ensure a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings. It is clear that well-designed mediation procedures are a cheaper and quicker alternative to judicial proceedings, and have the added bonus of preserving the relationship that was built up before the start of the dispute. This report, which I endorsed, looks in detail at how the Member States have transposed the main provisions of this legislative act. It transpires that, although the regulatory approaches vary, and there are some slight delays, the majority of the Member States not only meet the requirements of the directive but even exceed them, which I am pleased about.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It does not often happen that despite the fact that different models have been adopted in national systems, we can commend the Member States for their implementation of an EU directive. Mediation as an institution is already generally recognised in national legislation, but we must take care to ensure that the letter of the law is given life and has broad practical application. I think that current efforts both of Member States and of EU institutions should be directed towards promoting the instrument of mediation among the citizens and European firms, because often, they are not aware of the opportunities of using mediation, do not completely understand the principle on which it operates and are afraid that the result of such negotiations will not be legally binding. Therefore, the campaign to promote mediation should stress that it is a rapid, cheap and professional means of resolving disputes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of crucial significance is the position of mediators and the way they are perceived. They must be people in positions of public trust, and their neutrality and independence must be confirmed by the creation of a code of ethics and by legislation. In addition, the quality of the mediation process itself should be enhanced by consolidating the good practices and standards which – as we can read from the report – are already beginning to bring good results and confirm the legitimacy of the assumption that mediation can be effective and – apart from the undoubted benefits for the parties – that it can, in the future, relieve the pressure on courts which have a backlog of cases.</p>

The purpose is to provide additional legal certainty to the export credit agencies of the Member States. Export credits are effective instruments for supporting Union companies, as they are able to help with job creation and the implementation of projects that could otherwise have difficulties with financing. The fact that ever more applications are being received would suggest that the Member States need to introduce the OECD Agreement quickly.

In fact, the majority of Member States have export credit agencies (ECAs), which play an essential role in supporting European trade and business investment; this support was to the sum of EUR 468 billion during the period 2004-2009. The framework for this support is the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures – ‘the Agreement’ – negotiated between member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Such support is a public finance instrument to which the European Union is committed. Given that these agencies mainly support industrial activities that are harmful to the environment, in particular through CO2 production, and that, according to the World Bank, their effect on poverty reduction is insignificant, I agree with the rapporteur’s position that ECAs should contribute to the implementation of EU policies and objectives, without the need to review the OECD Agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">We already voted on this report back in the spring. However, it was referred back to committee. Now, after further negotiations, satisfactory results have been achieved. Official and officially supported export credit agencies are important sources of official financing for private sector projects, including in developing countries. In these times of overstretched national budgets, they are increasingly important for investments by European corporations, provided they do not have to be refinanced with taxpayers’ money. Since risk is assessed differently by official export credit agencies than in the case of loans provided by private banks, competition can be distorted in international trade – as the Chinese example illustrates.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, there are various sets of rules, such as OECD and WTO agreements, which set out repayment requirements within a certain time limit and a Minimum Premium Rate.

European Union Member States lack many of the raw materials they require and are therefore forced to import them from other countries. It is very important for the European Union to launch partnerships with countries in Eastern Europe, South America or Asia which have useful raw materials or minerals.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is also expected that in future, a partnership will be formed with China, because it controls 97% of global production of rare earth elements and severely restricts their export to other countries.

      <p sl="cs">The EU is highly dependent on imports for many raw materials. The rare earth elements are a particular case in point, with China currently controlling 97% of global production and curtailing their export. In this context, the raw materials initiative (RMI) is an important first step. The European Union needs to develop a coherent and focused strategy with priority actions, particularly for the most critical raw materials. In order to do this, the European Commission should not only differentiate between giving adequate focus to the RMI and commodity markets, but should also establish a working group on raw materials that encompasses all the relevant Directorates-General. Such an inter-departmental working group should develop priority actions for the critical raw materials, particularly the rare earths, and can ensure strategic cohesion. France and the US have already created such working groups. It is in this context that the creation of an Innovation Partnership on raw materials gains particular urgency. Substitution is also a crucial aspect that needs to be better embedded in the European Commission’s RMI. The European Union needs to establish mutually-beneficial partnerships that provide a win-win for resource-rich countries and the EU itself. Besides an Africa-EU partnership, the EU could also promote partnerships with countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the US and Japan.</p>

At a time like the present, in which environmental risks and problems represent very real and widely-held concerns, it is important, above all, to incentivise the recycling and reuse of materials – especially the rarest of these, whose availability may be too limited to allow for their indiscriminate use – as well as to safeguard and respect natural habitats and biodiversity.</p>

Nonetheless, raw material use obliges us to consider very carefully how they are used, particularly at a time of crisis.

As such, Parliament should take a constant interest in raw materials diplomacy. Given that, by 2050, the European Union will record an almost 300% increase in raw material usage, it is essential to adopt a comprehensive and integrated strategy that advocates short- and long-term measures, and that achieves efficiency and recycling, without neglecting innovation. For this reason, and conscious that access to raw materials is essential to the welfare of the European public, I am voting for this report on an effective raw materials strategy for Europe, which recommends recovering and re-using these materials wherever possible, as well as making their extraction environmentally friendly, so as to minimise climate change.</p>

That is why we have made proposals with a view to preventing the physical market from being obscured by the financial market for ‘derivatives’, whose volume has been increasing disproportionately over the years.

Firstly, European businesses have no automatic right to access resources outside the EU.

The EU requires a strong industrial base, which is highly dependent upon adequate supplies of raw materials as it becomes more green, in order to move towards a low carbon economy and to remain competitive. The complexity of the administrative processes and the lack of coordination between administrations can result in delays of several years in obtaining authorisation for the exploitation of mineral resources. Such delays are excessive, increase the capital costs of investment and exclude small and medium-sized undertakings from the market. The EU is highly dependent on imports for many raw materials, particularly critical ones. Resource scarcity can aggravate the international political arena, possibly culminating in a scramble for resources and widening divisions between resource-rich and resource-poor countries.

The European Union needs a comprehensive and integrated strategy, focusing on short- and long-term measures that can be implemented domestically and internationally, particularly for critical raw materials such as rare earth elements. At the heart of this strategy must be an industrial innovation strategy based on resource efficiency and recycling, which are the only measures that adequately tackle the three-way challenge of ensuring future competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply. These are challenges that are faced, not just by those in government, but by all those involved; challenges that must be addressed through research and development activities for their substitution. Universities must be called on for this very purpose, to give their contribution, in their capacity as centres of research.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report supports raw materials diplomacy through the European External Action Service (EEAS) to ensure Europe’s industry can maintain access to vital raw materials such as those used in the hi-tech sector. A strong focus is also placed on reducing our reliance on imports by stepping up exploration and production within the EU (including research into better clean technologies) where possible. It also calls for recycling and re-use and a gradual ban on waste landfill, while at the same time advocating reopening old landfill sites to extract valuable scrap metal and raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s raw materials strategy must be efficient and fair, respecting the right of developing countries to benefit from their natural resources. It is also an opportunity for the EU to boost its internal industry, recycle more and be more efficient. The report adopted also makes clear that trade and development policies should go hand in hand and old colonialist approaches are unacceptable; agreements with third countries and the EU should include clauses on human rights, labour standards and corporate and social responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Developing an effective raw materials strategy constitutes one of the great challenges for the European Union’s economic development. On the one hand, there is a need to import a range of products essential if the EU is to start moving towards energy sustainability, whilst, on the other, there have been problems with importing products. As the rapporteur stresses, while these obstacles are hard to overcome, they could prove to be an opportunity to increase the efficiency of resource use. However, these are measures that cannot be adopted in isolation: although they enable a reduction in dependence on imports of raw materials, that does not prevent us from needing to introduce import policies, albeit fewer. EU diplomacy in relation to this problem, in which the Union’s position is adapted to the characteristics of the trading partner, therefore presents itself as a necessary way of contributing to the acquisition by EU companies of any raw materials that they lack.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. In accordance with the definition of the own-initiative report by the ITRE Committee, the rapporteur (Greens) took a targeted approach to ‘an effective raw materials strategy for Europe’ focusing on non-energy and non-agricultural raw materials and, in particular, on critical raw materials such as rare earths. The rapporteur turned the 3-pillar approach of the Commission on its head by placing primary emphasis on resource efficiency, reuse, recycling and substitution. The report insists also that domestic mining must not interfere with nature conservation targets (Natura 2000). The report prescribes a new cooperative philosophy for Europe’s raw materials-related relationships with developing countries, as well as with resource-rich emerging economies such as China. The report addresses in a comprehensive way issues of raw materials governance at an EU level and in the international arena.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I endorsed this report because Europe needs a proper raw materials strategy in order to increase its competitiveness. This need has been made all the more obvious by the affair recently referred to at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), where the European Union, the United States and Mexico are in conflict with China. The WTO has ruled in favour of the first group, which accused China of employing protectionist practices in order to increase the price of nine raw materials (including zinc, bauxite and magnesium). Although China is challenging this ruling, the European Union’s response is along the right lines: an ‘internal’ strategy, including incentives to recycle and to ensure transparency in relation to stocks, is no longer enough. The EU must use all the tools at its disposal, including trade protection instruments, to ensure that its businesses have free and fair access to raw materials. Furthermore, the EU, in its leading role as a promoter of human rights and fundamental freedoms, must do everything in its power to combat the trade in, and use of, minerals from conflict zones, not least by strengthening raw materials traceability systems and introducing a mandatory certification scheme for raw materials.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Where the Commission originally promoted (in this order) the accessibility of raw materials on the international market, mining and only then efficiency and recycling, in this new report, the emphasis is, first and foremost, on efficiency and the reuse, recycling and substitution of raw materials. The fact that mining, too, cannot thwart EU objectives relating to nature conservation (Natura 2000) and that a new philosophy relating to collaboration with developing countries has also been incorporated only makes the report better. What is more, it includes a number of solutions for the management of raw materials at European and international level. Supporting initiatives such as the Extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI) increases, for example, transparency in terms of both responsibility and in liability. The report also takes into consideration the social aspects of the raw materials issue. Finally, the report speaks out against speculation in raw materials.

This report focuses essentially on access to strategic raw materials, notably rare earth elements, also touching on efficiency, on reducing resource use, on recycling, on re-use and on waste management. To this end, the rapporteur calls for a European innovation partnership on strategic raw materials covering the domestic and foreign dimensions of their sustainability. At domestic level, he calls for greater cooperation between Member States, while outside Europe, he calls for partnerships with poorer countries, with Brazil, Russia, India and China, and with rich countries. A regularly updated list of raw materials considered critical and an evaluation analysing the risk to said materials, the establishment of a methodology for measuring the current status and future developments in resource efficiency, and the creation of a legal framework that encourages and promotes the recycling of raw materials are examples of measures proposed by this report for more effective governance and coordination. Finally, I should like to stress that it is important to combat the volatility of agricultural prices, so as to ensure a fair price for all those involved in the sector and for consumers.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Rocketing raw material prices have a direct impact on the European economy’s competitiveness and sustainability and on jobs in our countries. The EU must secure even-handed access to strategic raw materials at fair prices. To do this, a strategy is required which takes into account existing realities and outlines the new European raw materials road map.</p>
      <p sl="bg">On this point, the report reveals the strategic opportunities which the EU must start to capitalise on immediately. The main focus is on the efficient use of strategic and rare raw materials. Unfortunately, we have heaps of such raw materials in landfills, while, at the same time, fierce battles are being waged over access to them globally. Let us not wait for today’s landfills to become tomorrow’s mines.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There is huge potential for the use of recycled rare materials. This point is properly set out in the recommendations for the EU’s future raw materials strategy.

Unfavourable raw material prices are inhibiting the growth of Lithuanian exports. According to research data published last month by Swedbank, rising raw material prices are also having a major impact on high inflation in Lithuania. The huge increase in raw material prices also means that 2011 will be a difficult year for Lithuania’s construction sector. Construction companies are going bankrupt every month. The time has come for the EU to establish a strategy on industrial innovations, aimed at promoting sustainability and security of energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I agree with the rapporteur that the raw materials initiative is a first positive step.

European cooperation on this issue is all the more crucial given that the emergence of new, high mineral-consuming world powers is causing a mad dash for, and unbridled speculation on, these materials. This road map is therefore in keeping with the efforts already made by some Member States, during the last G8, who fully recognised the need to guarantee fair access, price stability and a sustainable supply of raw materials. Vitally important though this resources supply strategy is, the Union must also recognise that it is going to have to come up with alternatives to traditional raw materials from within. I am thinking, in particular, of algae: it is being used on an experimental basis to make third-generation biofuel and will have the advantage of solving the issues involved in stabilising agricultural commodity prices, which are discussed extensively in this report.

Terrorism is certainly not a recent phenomenon; however, in recent decades, it has taken new forms such as cyber-terrorism, and terrorist networks have become more complex in structure, means and financing, thus making the terrorist threat all the more difficult to fight.

Due to their EU membership, Bulgaria and Romania have to apply certain measures to preserve fish stocks, but the maximum effect cannot be achieved without the collaboration and cooperation of the other Black Sea States.

The situation with regard to the Black Sea is complicated: there is no legal document regulating fishing activity; there are endangered species; and there are serious environmental problems and altered ecosystems; and there is a struggle against illegal and damaging fishing.

Another thing that we must ensure as a matter of urgency is that operators are financially liable for any accidents that occur. In this respect, we could have done better in this report, but the principle was voted for: operators must prove that they have sufficient financial resources to compensate for any damage caused to the environment.

The 2010 oil spill tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico was the world’s biggest and had devastating human and environmental consequences. One of the reasons for the accident was the fact that the company responsible for oil exploitation lacked appropriate containment equipment. In order to ensure safety, it is necessary to appoint an authority in the European Union Member States that would approve the safety case before any operations involving the extraction of gas or oil resources can commence.

      <p sl="sk">Indigenous supplies of oil and gas provide an important contribution to the EU’s energy consumption and energy security. In the EU, over 90% of oil, and 60% of gas, is produced via offshore operations. Activity is not uniformly distributed across the EU and the large majority of operations take place in the North Sea. Not all offshore oil and gas activity in European waters occurs in EU-controlled waters. The Deepwater Horizon disaster prompted all those involved in the exploration and extraction of offshore oil and gas to reassess the safety of their industry. The ‘safety case’ approach is based on the risks specific to a given locality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The offshore oil and gas industry boasts an improving health and safety record for personnel. However, focus on the safety of personnel should not detract from that of procedures, especially in the scope of disaster prevention and management. I firmly believe that it is right to monitor the strict checks and constant testing and assessment of the environmental impact of chemicals, in order to ensure that they are appropriate in case of escape and to limit the impact on public health and the environment.</p>

Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, I voiced my support for an improvement in safety in order to prevent a repeat of this kind of disaster, which not only endangers marine ecosystems but also severely affects the economic sectors of fishing and tourism. Parliament has voted in favour of stricter controls by independent experts and of the adoption of contingency plans prior to each operation, which I believe is an effective and proportionate response to the need to improve the safety of these platforms. Parliament has also referred to the industry’s liability in the event of a disaster, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, but without overlooking the supervisory and coordinating role that the public sector must play. I am pleased that my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has insisted that no moratorium be imposed on the subject. Indeed, the introduction of a moratorium on all new deep-sea oil drilling in EU waters would be a disproportionate reaction to the need to ensure high safety standards across the EU.</p>

To this end, I should like to reiterate the need for greater dialogue and more effective cooperation between the supervisory bodies in order to normalise and improve the various European safety standards. It is also quite appropriate to remember that the riskiest drilling activities take place on the more than 1 000 installations in the North Sea, while in the Mediterranean Sea, the offshore installations are less dangerous since they do not extract oil and gas at critical depths. Every extraction operation must therefore be examined according to its characteristics and specific risks. We now await the Commission’s legislative proposal that will turn these rules guaranteeing our safety and that of our seas into binding measures.</p>

I believe that oil and gas companies should be held accountable for any and all damage they cause and should assume full liability, without any upper limit, for potential damage.

The ‘safety case’ is a risk-based, site-specific approach which requires operators to demonstrate to the relevant national health, safety and environmental authorities that all risks have been considered and controls implemented. The relevant authority should approve safety case documents and any subsequent changes to them before any operations can commence. Regulatory ‘hold-points’ prior to drilling ensure that activity is not automatic, and that operations cannot commence until risks have been considered and mitigated.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I voted in favour of guaranteeing the safety of offshore oil and gas activities because it is important that all drilling for oil and gas in the Union is bound by the same rules.</p>
      <p sl="fi">EU-wide systems of regulation, however, are now so advanced that methods of control and environmental protection should mainly be promoted using a site-specific approach and taking account of technical conditions. Whilst water depth undeniably influences the challenge of drilling, deep water and shallow seas cannot simply be regarded as being dangerous and safe respectively. Nor is drilling for oil and gas evenly distributed across the Union: the large majority of operations take place in the North Sea, which means that specific activities have to be established with reference to the site and surroundings.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although it is worth bearing in mind the financial liability that Member States have in the event of environmental damage, the focus should be on the prevention of accidents and minimising risk factors, rather than on mandatory industry mutual schemes or insurance. This points to the need for carefully drawn up safety cases and careful consideration of possible risks.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Guaranteeing the safety of drilling for oil and gas in large part refers to our responsibility towards the environment. Combating climate change and minimising the number of toxins entering the environment are important priorities. Despite this, however, the safety of drilling for oil and gas must be developed in a way that does not harm EU self-sufficiency. Banning all deep-sea drilling for oil would not just be a disproportionate reaction, but it would also be unworkable.

I agree with the proposal that the introduction of a moratorium on new deep-sea oil drilling in all EU waters would be an illogical, rash and disproportionate reaction to the need to secure high safety standards across the EU. When adopting decisions and regulating offshore oil exploration and extraction activities, it is necessary to take examples of best practice into account and implement principles aimed at controlling offshore hazards. I believe that a transparent, consistent and efficient set of rules applying to all employees working in the offshore sector should enter into force at EU level.

The European Parliament calls on the Commission and Member States to encourage women’s participation in local chambers of commerce, lobbying groups and industry-based organisations that form the mainstream business community so that they can develop and strengthen competitive business skills. It also calls on chambers of commerce to actively invite female entrepreneurs to become involved and to promote the setting-up of special services and representative groups for female entrepreneurs to assist their empowerment and the development of an enterprise culture.

Given the importance of SMEs in Europe – in terms of employment percentages (around 67% compared with 32% in large corporations) and added value for the economy (just under 60%) – I think that stimulating all sectors of small and medium-sized enterprise is of particular importance.

      <p sl="pt">In Europe, we are currently witnessing an increasing movement of women participating in the labour market, which is also manifesting itself in the world of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although there have been improvements compared to the past, data shows us, nonetheless, that gender equality in the area of entrepreneurship has not yet been fully achieved. Women find it harder to start up entrepreneurial activity, either because of society’s deep-rooted preconceptions or because of coordinating work with family life, all of which leads to a severe economic and social situation in Europe and the world. I therefore consider it extremely important to combat this status quo through policies to support women entrepreneurs, to reduce gender inequality, to establish professional advice and training structures at all levels, and to provide better access to funding and social measures that would enable free choice in conjunction with family life. I am also in favour of establishing cross-border cooperation programmes for supporting women entrepreneurs, which would enable the exchanging of experiences, the streamlining of resources and the sharing of best practices. It is only with strong, concerted policies that women will be able to participate in the world of entrepreneurship on a more equal footing.</p>

All the studies show that the wealth created by those enterprises greatly contributes to the economic growth of the European Union. It is vital to support women who wish to set up their own business; funding must be put in place, but the situation as a whole must be rethought, with tools that allow for, among other things, a work-life balance. I fully support this report, which suggests interesting ways of encouraging women to develop businesses. Raising girls’ awareness of entrepreneurship and management is crucial if we want to try to reverse the prevailing trend. The European Commission and the Member States should create programmes to achieve this. There is also a need to encourage networking among women entrepreneurs, so that they can share their experiences and practices and highlight the obstacles they still face.

In fact, I believe this quota system will only serve to undermine the role of women in a business environment. Whilst I acknowledge the gender pay gap, the advancement of women in the workforce should be based on individual merit, not on gender. At present, there are varying support systems for entrepreneurs, some offering more support than others.

      <p sl="pt">The term ‘entrepreneurship’ has become generalised and commonplace, and is applied widely. This is not innocent. ‘Entrepreneurship’ represents the concept of creating your own job; the idea that employment or the lack thereof is not a social problem to which society and the state – its organised expression – should seek solutions, but a problem exclusively of the individual – a problem for them to resolve in whatever way is within their physical and mental capabilities. The gradual introduction of this concept is inseparable from the erosion of labour relations, and from the concrete and real loss of jobs, particularly through the destruction of productive sectors, as is happening in Portugal. The situation of women, who, in many cases, continue to experience unfavourable positions and suffer discrimination at all levels in the workplace, is of particular concern.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us not forget the gap between the average wages of men and women, which is around 18% and which the crisis is tending to exacerbate. This report leaves many of these issues to one side and is crippled by a number of contradictions, so we did not vote for it.

      <p sl="pt">We therefore did not vote for this report because it includes a number of contradictions. Moreover, while we recognise the importance of supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, we think there is a need to warn of the increasingly significant situation of the false self-employed, who, in truth, constitute an open door to precarious employment conditions, behind which is the intention of scaling back workers’ rights.</p>

For female entrepreneurs, the stakes can be even higher as they may have to overcome discrimination in what has traditionally been a male environment. Many have to juggle their own aspirations to succeed alongside their commitment to their family. Even though we live in the 21st century, the woman is still very much in the forefront in the home, especially where she is a mother. It is important to recognise women’s abilities in the workplace and to strengthen their position. This will not only encourage women to move into the business world, but will also ensure they move on to an even playing field where there is no room for gender discrimination. EU Member States differ in both their approach to women looking towards running their own businesses and the support given.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is a surprising report that Ms Yannakoudakis has drafted on a subject about which the report itself says that practically nothing is known, due to the dearth of relevant statistics and studies. As a result, the report plays into stereotypes. It says that the apparent ‘under-representation’ of women at the helm of SMEs could only be due, primarily, to the existence of discriminatory practices or persistent ‘societal’ stereotypes from which women themselves are said to suffer. Ms Yannakoudakis’s main proposal, therefore, is to introduce specific, preferential measures to help women manage their businesses. One navigates between nannying and positive discrimination, that counterproductive policy that casts a permanent doubt over the true abilities and talents of the people whom it is supposed to benefit. When will quotas and the obligation to set up a business be introduced for all women? Ms Yannakoudakis could have concentrated on the real, objective reasons that make women hesitate about taking the plunge and starting up a business. There are enough of them, starting with the difficulties in balancing this very time-consuming activity and their family life. She could have also focused on the social and financial recognition of housewives and ‘assisting’ spouses, real jobs that are seldom remunerated. She chose pseudo-feminist dogmatism instead.</p>

It is therefore important to incentivise female entrepreneurship through targeted actions. This can be achieved, in particular, through easier access to credit – in which case the European Microfinance Instrument Progress can be of major help – or by subsidising exchange initiatives, similar to an Erasmus scheme for young female entrepreneurs, which could encourage women to embark on such a professional vocation.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Ms Yannakoudakis on female entrepreneurship in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). I did so because we need to guarantee a work-life balance for the women who work in the many SMEs across Europe in order to help the women who start their own business to be able to guarantee their own financial and working independence. I am also thinking, in particular, about the need for Member States to adopt policies setting up suitable child care facilities, which is an absolute necessity for women who intend to start a business. I have expressed my concern that many businesses run by women are to be found in the regions where Objective 1 of the Structural Funds is applied, which will soon no longer be considered disadvantaged regions following the accession of new countries. One of the problems for these regions is the fact that the rural areas where it would be desirable to develop SMEs are not yet sufficiently developed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the report on women entrepreneurship in small and medium-sized enterprises. At a time when European economies are running out of steam and the economic crisis is still affecting a large number of citizens, it is crucial to invest in women. This ongoing imbalance between men and women with regard to setting up businesses is unjustifiable and ineffective. This report promotes both financial support instruments for setting up SMEs and information for women concerning the various options available to them to help them start a business. It also rightly recommends the introduction of policies catering for the specific problems encountered by women. In particular, it highlights the importance of measures to help women achieve a work-life balance, as this is a major obstacle for many women and prevents them from taking the step of starting a business. Emphasis is also placed on the prevention of all kinds of discrimination against women: it is high time that equal treatment applied in every area.</p>

It is vital to acknowledge women’s abilities in the workplace and assist them using means such as an EU report to strengthen their position.

The report thus centres on and overstates the simple task of facilitating the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises by women. This report was drawn up from an entirely liberal economic standpoint, and therefore does not take into account the value of other economic activities, such as cooperatives and public economic initiatives, which are programmes and mechanisms that could bring about real progress in gender equality.</p>

The existence of the required support services, the support of Member States and their local governments and academic institutions, for instance, through entrepreneurship incubators, is one of the main preconditions for positive development. An entrepreneur-friendly environment that promotes enterprising women will also guarantee a positive result. In my home country of Estonia, for instance, the development of the e-society has helped make women more enterprising, even when they are at home on maternity leave. Today, e-services, even shopping via the Internet, are extremely popular, and, as a result, the development of Internet-based commercial activities holds great promise. I thereby call upon women to make greater use of the possibilities offered us by the Internet, which remove long distances and offer better possibilities to combine work and family life.</p>

Consequently, it is very important to establish efficient mechanisms ensuring the effective implementation of gender equality policy. It should be noted that small and medium-sized business manifests itself as a vehicle for women to achieve economic independence. Consequently, the Member States must increase fair and equal access to finance for business entities, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in which women are engaged in business. The public must be made more aware of the European Progress Microfinance Facility, opportunities to implement it and the benefits it brings. In order to develop female entrepreneurship, the Member States should establish special national education programmes, implement cross-border cooperation programmes and encourage women to participate in the work of the mainstream business community.

      <p sl="en">Female entrepreneurs must often overcome discrimination in order to operate in what has traditionally been a male environment. The European Commission’s Report of the Investment Readiness for Women Entrepreneurs Workshop concluded that female entrepreneurs often have different goals for their businesses and face greater difficulties than men in accessing finance. Women can also face institutional, legislative and infrastructural barriers as well as barriers relating to inadequate child care provision. Women are now a significant part of the workforce of Member States. Indeed, in 2010, women represented 46% of the total labour market in Ireland. Last week, the Irish Minister for Small Business launched a new National Mentoring Programme for Female Entrepreneurs as part of a wider EU Commission initiative called European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs. The programme aims at boosting female entrepreneurship and supports women’s start-ups in their first year of activity. Boosting female enterprise promises valuable returns for an economy, and it is in the interest of policy makers to remove barriers to entrepreneurship by women. More must be done to encourage women to become entrepreneurs and to eliminate the barriers facing them.</p>

The figures are striking: in Europe, one in four working men is an entrepreneur, compared with only one in ten women. The obstacles are, however, well known: less social protection for the self-employed, fewer rights, more risks, and greater difficulty in achieving a work-life balance. The Member States have everything to gain from exploring new ways of creating jobs: promoting female entrepreneurship is part of this approach. They would be well advised, for example, to promote underused sources of finance, such as the Progress Microfinance Facility, a European tool enabling people who want to start their own business but do not have access to traditional banking services to obtain loans of up to EUR 25 000. Our resolution also discusses the need to extend the ‘Erasmus for young entrepreneurs’ programme, which enables young people to work for six months with experienced entrepreneurs in another EU country: a genuine passport to training for our young people and a worthwhile gamble on the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, energy is the lifeblood of our national economies. We therefore want price developments to remain transparent for consumers. I regret to say that there are still too many deals and agreements being made behind the scenes. In the end, it is consumers who foot the bill, in the form of severely inflated energy prices. This is not just annoying; it also has real effects on growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want a better internal energy market. Europe needs transparent energy markets that are protected from abuse. This is precisely what the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency aims to achieve, and that is what we are talking about here. I would specifically like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger for their positive cooperation. This is exactly how European legislation needs to be made – in the way that we have brought it about here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am particularly pleased that the European dimension of energy trading is stressed in the text that will be put to the vote tomorrow. One of the main issues was whether or not we need a special law on this. Do we need a sector-specific approach or could energy trading simply be subject to the general regulations for financial markets? When it comes down to it, however, energy markets have different rules; energy traders are not banks. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Oettinger for having done all he could to ensure this matter was put to the House quickly. That was essential for a sector-specific approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">The negotiations with the Hungarian Presidency were tough and we succeeded in getting a result at first reading. Parliament – my fellow Members – introduced seven new points into the Commission’s text. The first important point was the introduction of an approval system for a register of electricity traders. This regulation now sets out the requirement of a national register of electricity traders. It also provides for the establishment of a European register which is to be organised by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission is to evaluate the registration system in the future and propose further instruments to improve it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: there is a link-up with CO2 emissions trading. The regulation gives the ACER access to existing databases relating to trading in emissions certificates. Although Member States are not required to keep such records and the ACER is not being given the rights of control, the Commission is asked to present a legislative proposal to deal with the deficits in the CO2 market system.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly: there will be penalties, and we have worked to harmonise these penalties and to achieve minimum standards. Following pressure from Parliament, the damage caused to consumers is to be given particular consideration when deciding on sanctions. In addition, the Commission has been given the opportunity to table a proposal on minimum standards for penalties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly: the role of the agency and the national regulatory authorities have been strengthened. Parliament wanted to strengthen the ACER, which is why we have pushed for the director of the ACER to be more independent. The director of the ACER is to consult national provisions, but should not be bound by these.</p>
      <p sl="de">A fifth important point: there is a revision clause in respect of staffing and resources. Parliament would like the ACER to be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources to be able to perform its new tasks. This is emphasised in a new recital. The ACER needs to be better equipped if it is to be guaranteed a strong presence in important organised market places.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sixthly: naturally, insider trading is banned, but we have agreed one exemption when it comes to insider trading. This exemption may be applied only in the event of a direct physical loss resulting from unplanned outages. This exemption is allowed in order to provide security in the system, since otherwise players in the market would be unable to discharge their contractual obligations or to act by agreement with the competent transmission system operator.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to continue speaking now rather than saving two minutes until the end.</p>
      <p sl="de">The seventh and final point concerns delegated acts versus implementing acts. This was a tough one in the negotiations – it was a central issue, and, in part, we were breaking new ground as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament has conceded some of its demands concerning delegated acts in favour of a stronger role for the ACER and in favour of more detailed directions in the section on penalties. This was a trade-off that we made. One important element of the final package is that all the aspects relating to data collection will be laid down by an implementing act rather than a delegated act. This also applies to the setting of a de minimis threshold for the definition of reporting obligations. Nonetheless, the Commission will reserve the right to make a proposal ahead of any legislative proposal on such a threshold. This is also enshrined in the text as part of a declaration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, we have achieved a good result. I am very satisfied. The Hungarian Presidency was a tough negotiating partner, but with the assistance of my colleagues from all the other groups, we succeeded in achieving a genuinely satisfactory result. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, especially to my Hungarian colleague, Mr Gyürk, because he naturally had a particularly direct line to the Presidency; however, everyone was involved in the trialogue negotiations. We achieved near unanimity in committee. I would be pleased if we could do the same in plenary. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I have the privilege, today, of speaking on behalf of the Polish Presidency in the debate on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy market integrity and transparency. Work on this regulation has proceeded at extraordinary speed – the Commission’s proposal was submitted only in December of last year. I would like, here, to thank the Hungarian Presidency, because it is thanks to their efforts that today we have the opportunity to discuss the negotiated text of the regulation. I would also like to offer my sincere thanks to the representatives of the European Parliament and, in particular, to Mr Chatzimarkakis and the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for their valuable contribution to the work on this regulation. I would like, in addition, to highlight the particularly important contribution made to the work done on the regulation by the Chair of the Committee, Mr Reul.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Presidency attaches particular importance to the internal market. It is the basis of European integration and a key factor for economic growth. A priority of the Presidency is to endeavour to strengthen the internal market and complete its construction, so that full use can be made of its potential for growth. The internal market should become a key factor in the way the European economy recovers its competitiveness and overcomes the effects of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The establishment of a fully functioning European internal market for electricity and gas has, in recent years, been the subject of the particular concern of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament alike, and the energy market has been increasingly liberalised and integrated. To ensure that the internal energy market functions correctly, and to make full use of its potential, it is necessary to ensure the market’s transparency across the European Union. The citizens, businesses and the authorities have to be sure that it is working correctly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The current system of EU law is not sufficient to prevent abuses connected with trade in the energy market. Europe needs a strong energy market which is integrated, transparent and able to react quickly to all forms of manipulation and even to attempts at manipulation. The fact that a well-developed and financially sound wholesale gas and electricity market is in operation gives businesses the certainty that they will be able to react with flexibility to changes in market conditions. To this end, close cooperation is planned between ACER – the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators – and national regulatory and other competent authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To this end, too, uniform provisions have been created concerning the scope of data and information to be collected and the means for doing so, and similarly concerning the way the wholesale gas and electricity markets are to be monitored. I should like to make clear, here, that REMIT, the Regulation on European Energy Market Integrity and Transparency, gives a particular implementing role to ACER. Particular responsibility will rest with the agency’s director, Alberto Pototschnig, who is present today and is following our debate, and its Administrative Board, which is chaired by Piotr Woźniak, who has also honoured us with his presence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The regulation gives a clear definition of the concept of abuses, and imposes a prohibition on abuses in the wholesale market for electricity and derivative products and in the wholesale market for natural gas and derivative products. These provisions include a clear prohibition on insider trading and market manipulation. The provisions have been formulated in such a way as to ensure they are consistent with MAD, the Market Abuse Directive, and MiFID, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. The regulation is an important step towards achievement of our objective in terms of building an EU internal energy market by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We all agree that the energy market has to be competitive and dynamic. However, for this sector to develop properly, it has to be based on and regulated by transparent principles. The regulation we are discussing today is one of several factors which give this market a new form.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to express my particular gratitude for the intensive efforts made by all the institutions during the negotiations, which led to a successful outcome in the form of a political consensus on 23 June. We have worked very hard and fast and, as a result, have achieved agreement at first reading and in barely a few months. I should like, therefore, to urge the House to endorse this act, which is an expression of compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and which will contribute to an increase in the integrity and transparency of the energy market.</p>

    <intervention id="2-481-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Korolec, honourable Members, the internal market in electricity is now 15 years old and European legislation on gas has been in place for 12 years. Since then, we have been in the implementation phase. The internal market means transparency for consumers, competition between the providers of products and services and the application of market economy rules. For this reason, I believe that introducing regulations to prevent possible market abuse is a significant and logical step forward, as part of the process of creating the internal market, which we will be working to establish within the next four years using all the technical, economic and competition law-related measures at our disposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Deregulation and the internal market in electricity and gas have brought about changes in the landscape of the energy exchanges and marketplaces. Clear regulations and restrictions are needed, in particular, to ensure that the marketplaces and energy exchanges function effectively. Without these regulations, it would be difficult to ensure a safe, sustainable and fair supply of energy at a reasonable cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">The wholesale prices that are under discussion today and the wholesale markets are also relevant to consumers, at least indirectly, and have an influence on the size of their future energy bills. Therefore, it is in everyone’s interest that the marketplaces function properly. First and foremost, it is in the interest of consumers, European citizens and also the market participants, in other words, the product and service providers.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is precisely the intention of the regulation we are debating today: to generate confidence in the market processes. As the rapporteur has already mentioned, this regulation is a lex specialis. We have spent a long time evaluating whether the general market rules can be applied on a one-to-one basis and have come to the conclusion that the specific nature of the energy markets requires special rules, special procedures and separate authorities, in order to prevent market abuse and attempts to manipulate the market and in order to uncover activities of this kind and impose sanctions on the perpetrators.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a clearly worded code of conduct which, together with the European marketing monitoring body that forms part of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the well-defined responsibilities of the authorities, represents a supervisory framework for the traded energy markets that we believe sets international standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank everyone involved for the intensity and speed of the debate, including Parliament and you, Mr Chatzimarkakis, because you have put a great deal of effort into this. The fact that it was possible to complete the debates within six months is due to the goodwill, competence and integrity of all the honourable Members and also to the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency during this period. I am very grateful for this. The suggestions for improvements that we have received also indicate that constructive discussions have taken place.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that this proposal is in the interest of fair emissions trading and that the division of responsibilities between the European level and the regulators in the Member States represents a practical solution. We have not transferred all the tasks to the European level, but it is also the case that in a European internal market, the responsibility cannot lie entirely with the national regulators.</p>
      <p sl="de">After you have adopted this regulation tomorrow, we will begin putting it into effect immediately. This involves the necessary implementing acts which will enable the data collection process required for market monitoring purposes to be established quickly. We are relying on the ACER and on effective cooperation between this European body and the regulators in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important to me that this proposal for a regulation functions as a tailor-made supplement to the general financial regulations. The provisions of the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Market Abuse Directive (MAD) also apply, in principle, to the energy market participants. Both directives are currently being revised and will be adapted to meet the new requirements of the financial markets. Therefore, I recommend that you focus your attention on developing these general rules, which are also important for the energy market and the wholesale markets, and apply your knowledge from the fields of energy and industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will ensure that only those changes which are absolutely necessary will be made to the energy market. In this respect, it is important to me that those market participants which are trading in energy not primarily for the sake of trading, but because their core business requires them to do so, are not burdened with excessive regulation. Some of the rules which apply to the financial markets are not relevant to the energy market and can often involve regulations that are too far-reaching.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thank you for your very constructive work here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, 60 seconds is not very long to defend consumer interests in the face of energy market abuses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text on which we are going to vote tomorrow is a compromise between the two legislative arms, and, as usual, the Council has been less ambitious than the European Parliament. It is often said that lobbyists have too much influence over the European Parliament, but I find that national lobbies seem to concentrate on the ministries instead.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I personally called for greater vigilance in the face of attempted market abuses and insider trading. I am none too pleased that the text on which we are going to vote agrees with, I quote, ‘accepted market practices on the wholesale energy market’. Certain dubious practices should be eliminated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would have also genuinely preferred tougher penalties, particularly at European level, and not just ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ ones. Time will tell whether the penalties, which will remain national, are sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude, Mr President, by stressing that the text should not read that the agency ‘should be provided with the appropriate financial and human resources’, but that it ‘will have to be provided’ with those same financial and human resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to warmly welcome my friend, Minister Korolec, who, for the first time, is representing the Polish Presidency in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The goal of this regulation is twofold: to increase transparency and prevent market abuse. We in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection were obviously concerned with the impact on consumers. As Commissioner Oettinger said, it has an impact on energy prices, which is of utmost importance to consumers. It is also important because it has an impact on energy security. It would prevent the formation of monopolies abusing their dominant position.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am especially glad that our idea to take into account damages caused to consumers when determining penalties for breaking the rules was included in the final compromise. I thank the rapporteur for that. Most importantly, this regulation brings us closer to achieving this House’s great ambition of creating the single market in energy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our common goal to create a single European energy market by 2014. We want a single European energy market because we believe that it is in the interest of European consumers; after all, this is our only way to keep energy prices in check, increase supply security and prevent commercial abuse. However, there is still much work to be done until this single market can be created. We are lagging behind not only in putting missing cables and infrastructure connections in place, but also on the regulatory side. We are lagging behind in implementation, but so are we in making new legislation. The REMIT report fills such a regulatory gap in the field of wholesale energy trade.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This law will allow for the monitoring of cross-border wholesale trade in gas and electricity in the future. Today, the majority of energy products are exchanged in an international market. That is why the current practice of Member State-level monitoring is inadequate to effectively eliminate abuse. Thanks to this law, the European Energy Agency will now also have detailed information about previously non-public wholesale transactions. Thanks to this law, only registered wholesalers will be allowed to trade energy even in countries that do not yet operate a licensing scheme. Finally, thanks to this law, the parties responsible for abuse will be clearly identifiable when penalties are imposed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, these are important achievements, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for making them possible. As the chief spokesperson on this issue within the Group of the European People’s Party, I also wish to thank him for his cooperation. Allow me to express my congratulations that, with the help of the Hungarian Presidency, the – I am convinced – best possible compromise for both the Member States and Parliament could be reached within such a short time, in agreement with the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis very much for his hard work and for the ongoing, effective cooperation on this subject which has enabled us to achieve good results, in consultation, of course, with the Council and the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="de">As has already been mentioned, this is all about consumer protection. Is it absolutely necessary to adopt a regulation of this kind and to protect consumers against market abuse and insider trading? I believe that it is. Recent cases in the USA in particular have shown that market participants are very likely to make repeated attempts to exploit their market power and to take part in insider trading, because this is something that almost goes with the territory. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we take measures to prevent this.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Mr Gyürk has already said, we are now part of a European network. The energy industry is, thank goodness, no longer a purely national or regional issue. Instead, it is a European network and, therefore, we need European regulations. This does not mean that the national authorities and, in particular, the national regulatory bodies, no longer have a job to do. The work must, of course, be carried out primarily by the national authorities, which have an overview of the markets and the market participants. However, they must cooperate closely with the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). It is very important that we maintain an overview of the situation in Europe and take these connections and networks into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">The register is also important. Many of us wanted more than just a register with an approval procedure, but perhaps this would have involved too much red tape. We must wait and see. We now have a register which has, and will continue to obtain, the relevant information to allow the regulatory bodies to act appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="de">The penalties and sanctions have already been referred to, in particular, by Mr Gyürk. It makes no sense to take action against market powers and market abuse if, at the same time, there is no possibility of imposing penalties. It would also not be a sensible approach for some countries to have stiff penalties and others more lenient ones, because the companies would move to the countries where the penalties were less stringent. For this reason, we need to harmonise the situation over the course of time.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point concerns the delegated acts. Mr Oettinger has given us his opinion on this. I hope, Mr Oettinger, that you take the right approach to the delegated acts and I would like to take this opportunity to mention the fact that we felt that this approach was slightly lacking in your references to hoisting flags and flying them at half mast. If every country which does not complete a specific task only flies its flags at half mast, we must ask all the countries to fly their flags at half mast. We need to be a little more modest with regard to this question. Otherwise, Mr Oettinger, I and my group value your commitment to energy issues very highly, when you focus your attention on them.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, an effective price mechanism will determine whether we can have an effective energy market. An effective energy market is a cornerstone of smart climate policy. The ownership structure is an important contributory factor when it comes to prices, but an explanation can also be found in the lack of transparency. As a result of the lack of competition, electricity companies’ income from electricity network charges has increased sharply.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As usual, there are politicians proposing various different types of planned economy experiments to solve these problems. There is one thing that I would like to make very clear, however. Re-regulation or monopolisation of energy production and distribution will never provide the solution. Instead, the future is a more transparent market where the combined power of all of Europe’s consumers is able to set the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the energy production that future consumers will encounter will look rather different. Therefore, the network needs to be rebuilt in order to cope with feed-in electricity generation schemes. In order to avoid electricity price shocks, there also needs to be an increase in the proportion of smart electricity meters. Consumers can then see the price and how much electricity is being consumed. It will be possible to choose both green electricity and the cheapest time of the day to switch the washing machine on. That will also give us a more uniform demand curve and a more consistent price level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In order to achieve all of this, we need investment. From the point of view of long-term competition, Europe’s level of investment, totalling 19% – which is only a third of the equivalent investment by China – needs to be increased. In order to contribute to this increase, we must improve cooperation between the private and public sectors.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With the aid of the legislation that we will vote through tomorrow, among other things, our policy can help by providing an incentive structure that will make investment in smart energy infrastructure more worthwhile. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, who has once again done a fantastic job on a difficult report. It will increase transparency in the energy market. General and long-term ground rules that help to provide a better and effective market are necessary in order for us to both achieve economic growth and meet our climate targets. Enormous sums need to be invested, but if there is something that is worth investing in, it is the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when the Commission and Parliament join forces and when we have a Presidency which makes things move, then Europe will go in the right direction. The regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) is a step forward to prevent the scandal of insider trading and manipulation. I think this is good for consumers, citizens and companies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are two or three things which I think we now have to get right. The first, which Robert Goebbels mentioned, is sanctions. It is really important that the Commission keeps a very close eye on how sanctions are transposed nationally, because we do not want regulatory dumping to attract certain traders to certain places. This must be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have put the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) into the driving seat. We need a European referee for the European market, but it is clear that the 15 additional people at ACER envisaged in the original Commission document will not be able to do any more than just automatic screening. What we need at ACER is a preliminary analysis, because otherwise they will flood the national regulatory agencies with potential cases every day. This is not an intelligent way to proceed, nor a good use of time, for ACER or for the national regulators. So my question to you is how can we make sure that ACER gets enough staff? ACER also needs a very highly sophisticated and secure ICT system. It is not secure today and we need to secure it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three issues for which we Greens have fought hard. One is regional cooperation between the national regulatory agencies. That is now in the text. It is clear that the markets are regional and so we need more regional cooperation between regulatory authorities. The second concerns minimum requirements for trading floors. In future, we want all trading to take place on trading floors and for there to be less over-the-counter trade done in dark rooms. For this we need minimum requirements. Lastly, we have established ACER as a trade repository, which means that academics, not only in Europe but worldwide, can now follow what is going on in European electricity and gas trading. We have also established a link to CO2 trading, which means that there will be an increasing level of external expertise to help us see where the weaknesses in the system are.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, I think the best thing the European Union can do for energy in Europe is to create true competition in the internal market. This competition will work to reduce prices both for individual and industrial consumers. This, in turn, will translate into profitability and competitiveness for our economy. True liberalisation can also improve energy security where it is threatened by suppliers whose position is too dominating and may perhaps be positively monopolistic. We are faced with such a situation in Central Europe, which is still too heavily dependent on the Russian firm Gazprom. For the market and competition to interact and to enable them to operate freely, it is necessary to build confidence and ensure guarantees of fair practices. In relation to the development of the wholesale electricity and gas market, and this includes the cross-border market in these products, it is necessary to have better coordination of national monitoring and inspection activities, and this will be possible with the entry into force of the Regulation on European Energy Market Integrity and Transparency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament has amended the European Commission’s proposal. We have brought in clear – or at least clearer – distinctions between the competences of national regulators and those of Brussels. We have agreed more specific principles concerning the adoption of delegated acts. We have introduced better guarantees for the confidentiality of the data which the parties will provide to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. Finally, we propose extending inspection activity to include derivative contracts from the CO2 emissions market, which, in the next few years, is certain to undergo extremely dynamic development. All of these things are reasons why, in the course of the next few years, it is certain that we will not be able to avoid talking about giving better financial support to the agency.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, when I was elected to the European Parliament more than seven years ago, I thought that I knew something about energy and the overall issue surrounding energy, that I knew my way around it, and that, in principle, I also understood it. After my first period in Brussels, I realised that I knew almost nothing. Now in my second period of work in Parliament, I increasingly feel that I have perhaps ceased to understand it. Why is that? The reason is that I am always hearing the pervasive mantra that liberalisation should bring cheaper energy for consumers. I must say, however, that this has never happened in seven whole years. If it has, show me the evidence. Meanwhile, under the key slogan of more stable, more reliable and cheaper energy supplies, we are adopting more and more regulations. In the end, the overall globalisation and liberalisation of the market does not ensure more reliable and cheaper energy. In the final analysis, it is always the consumer who shoulders the main costs, unlike the big players on the market, who definitely cannot complain about their profits.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The document submitted is relatively specialised and complex and I cannot rid myself of the feeling that it is, above all, the big players on the European energy market and therefore also the large Member States that best know their way around it and that have influenced it. It is nonetheless also true that the report brings elements of greater transparency, as already mentioned here. This is also thanks to the work of the rapporteur, which I would like to applaud heartily, as it has been an extremely demanding task. It is also true that the energy markets are of a cross-border nature, and clear rules are therefore essential.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we contributed a number of amendments strengthening the focus on the prevention of abuse and manipulation on the wholesale energy market. Despite all that, however, much remains to be done in this area, perhaps not least because there is still no linked-up pan-European energy market, and we are unable – or scarcely able – to respond flexibly and effectively to a crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, it really is very good that the European Union institutions have returned to one of the most important issues facing consumers recently. I am, of course, talking about the cost of electricity and gas.</p>
      <p sl="lt">At a time of economic crisis, the cost of electricity is becoming an important instrument helping all consumers survive and overcome further economic difficulties. Higher and recently more speculative prices for energy raw materials are driving both the business community and household customers to despair.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is for precisely these reasons and to force energy suppliers into a framework where they would be unable to abuse their dominant position that I support the provisions contained in the regulation to the effect that penalties for infringements should not only take into account the gravity of the infringements and the profits made, but also the damage caused to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I believe that this should also cover various possible disruptions to energy supply which might arise because of political disagreements between individual countries. Some European countries have experienced this, including Lithuania. The regulation must therefore contain safeguards to prevent such incidents from being repeated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are now beginning to realise, 10 years after the deregulation of the energy market, that it will not function entirely without rules. According to the Commission, deregulation should have led to reductions in prices, but, in fact, the opposite was the case. Insider trading and withholding capacity have resulted in some market participants playing a dominant role. The consequence of this has been fluctuating prices, with private households, as always, being the ones that suffer.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it makes sense for the wholesale traders to disclose the information relating to their pricing policies. However, creating yet another new agency with additional costs and administrative expense in order to achieve this is a highly questionable approach. The Commission could deal with this issue itself within the Directorate-General for Competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we need a minimum level of consistent sanctions, otherwise the companies will simply move their headquarters to the countries which have the least stringent sanctions.

We know that it is a criminal act to use internal information of a company on the general stock market to manipulate prices and make a profit at others’ expense. That is a criminal act. With the introduction of this regulation, we shall create a prohibition in the energy market similar to that on the stock market, since big energy producers will no longer be able to exploit internal information to manipulate consumer prices to the detriment of consumers. In the energy market, the winners from this regulation will precisely be our consumers, because by outlawing price manipulation, we shall achieve stable prices, which is one of our objectives. That is why I am appealing to you to support the introduction of this regulation in the energy market. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, as we have been saying over and over, a truly competitive internal energy market demands better grid interconnections, greater harmonisation of the guidelines and codes of practice for the network, and the completion of the process linking up all the energy markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the adoption of the regulation on energy market integrity and transparency is a particularly significant landmark. We need to ensure that gas and electricity prices appropriately represent how supply and demand interact, avoiding, as has already been mentioned, asymmetric practices for information access, market manipulation and abuse, and distortions that impede the existence of true competition.</p>
      <p sl="es">Given that these markets have their own technical peculiarities, it is now necessary for the European Commission, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the national energy regulatory bodies to progress with the creation of a common framework that is applicable to all operators within the spot energy markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">This common framework should provide the operators who currently participate in the different regional and national markets with harmonised access to them, thereby promoting European trade in electricity and gas, and a convergence towards a unique and competitive energy price in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures from the REMIT regulation will be implemented at national level by the national authorities, but at European level primarily by ACER. To this end, the agency must have, or rather ensure, adequate human resources and appropriate complex electronic equipment. However, the necessary prerequisite for both of these is sufficient financial support and I fully agree with the views expressed earlier by Mr Turmes. Commissioner Oettinger has spoken about this as well. I am concerned that the European Commission’s assessment of what resources are necessary to implement the REMIT regulation are quite different from those of ACER itself.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For example, the European Commission has estimated that we will need 15 additional employees, whereas ACER estimated 56. The estimates of the financial resources needed for equipment also differ by more than double. Obviously, I am interested in why there is such a great discrepancy, what the actual financial cost will be, and what will happen in the event of limited funding.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I have to emphasise that I am in favour of ACER being given sufficient means to carry out its operations properly. However, I do not support the establishment of additional discrete units and the expense this entails. Considering that an agency office has already been established in Brussels, I am also interested in the legal basis for this decision. Allow me, finally, to reiterate the following: I am concerned that there will not be enough money for the operations which we all agree should be carried out under the REMIT regulation. We cannot allow this situation to occur. The regulation must be implemented and that means in its entirety.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, here in the European Parliament, we often debate issues relating to energy poverty. We talk about energy supply and the switching of energy sources. However, as long as manipulation and a lack of transparency are the order of the day, it will be very difficult to make any progress. In that sense, a weakly regulated energy market will function just as badly as a weakly regulated financial market. We have seen what can happen.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) will now have a stronger position. Clearly, we must also fight for more resources in order to be able to use this position. We will have a register and we will have sanctions, which is good for electricity consumers. However, I would have liked to have seen much more in the way of regulations. I do not have a blind faith in the free, wholly unregulated market, which is very clear when it comes to energy issues in particular. I am nevertheless very grateful for the work that has been done by the rapporteur and everyone else. This is the first step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Korolec, Commissioner, transparency is a requirement for the increased integration of the EU energy market. This integration brings clear benefits for consumers. The regulation adopted today is a step forward towards the completion of the internal energy market by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The regulation establishes a database of transactions in the wholesale energy market and a European register of market participants, so as to prevent unfair practices. Unfair practices in the wholesale energy market affect price levels and harm consumers. Lack of transparency can lead to increased prices for end consumers and can undermine the confidence of potential investors in infrastructure projects. This regulation is, therefore, crucial for the smooth functioning of the internal market, and the confidence of consumers and investors in the internal energy market.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. This report is proof that more Europe means a better Europe to European citizens. Our task is clear: we must facilitate optimal energy use and rational infrastructure development, and protect consumers. We support EU-level regulation of the wholesale trade in gas and electricity; we support and ask for the continuing independence of such regulation and for the provision of resources. Finally, we definitely ask that since the price of any distortion is paid by consumers, that is, ultimately by European citizens, this should especially be incorporated in penalties and taken into account. It is on this basis that European consumers will decide about us, about whether more Europe is indeed better for them. I wish for it to be so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, what we need to do, and this is more important than ever, is to ensure that the energy markets are made more transparent and are monitored more effectively and that any attempt to manipulate or abuse the markets is uncovered and punished. We need an internal energy market and we must overcome the existing boundaries. Only clear rules on transparency and uniform sanctions throughout the whole of Europe will enable us to overcome the current boundaries and prevent abuse.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aim with this regulation is to create an instrument to stop market abuse in the energy sector. It proposes a common European approach to the ban on insider trading and market manipulation in the wholesale energy markets for all electricity and natural gas products not covered by the Market Abuse Directive. It is fortunate that we are not providing for the costs of data collection in this report, that the boundary costs will not be transferred, and that the harmonisation of penalties across the Member States has been included at the instigation of the European Parliament, in order to prevent forum shopping.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the scope of the regulation is concerned, it is clear that wholesale energy markets should include not only the organised energy exchanges but also the unregulated markets, because their transactions could have an influence on trading on the energy exchanges. This approach will reinforce the integrity of the market and strengthen consumer confidence.</p>

We need to bear in mind that the incidence of abuses on the energy market in one particular Member State can have repercussions across the whole European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to reiterate that energy liberalisation must primarily benefit consumers, boost investments and not create tycoons over night, as has happened in some Member States, like Romania. We must not forget that the basic purpose of the European energy market is to offer consumers lower prices by stimulating competition.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European regulatory agency must play an important role in preventing market abuses and manipulation, which cause price rises for consumers, and help inform European citizens about the rights they have in a competitive market. I should stress that national regulatory authorities must accept communication and cooperation with the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report is a victory for those who want to strengthen the internal market and transparency standards in the energy field. In that sense, it is a further step towards the Europeanisation of energy policy, and I welcome that very much.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that long-term contracts are included in the information that has to be reported. Some said during the discussions that this is against market rules, that we should not disclose information, contracts, etc. I think that to exclude often secretive contracts would continue to distort the market. Now, as these backroom deals will be more open, energy prices will truly reflect the reality of supply and demand.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must now take this transparency one step further. We should move towards more transparency in international gas agreements. They are often contradictory to the law and values of the European Union, so I very much welcome the Commission proposal for a decision on information for international agreements. The Commission should also work towards greater transparency of the ownership of energy firms. Today, it is all but impossible to know who owns what. Companies that are in competition, in theory, could, in fact, be owned by the same individual. We should know more – of course, it is impossible to control everything and to know everything – but we should know more about who is actually controlling market activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, of course we should welcome the fact that the new EU regulations allow us to take action against unfair tactics, such as withholding energy capacity. However, the extent to which we can prevent insider trading remains to be seen. It is doubtful whether a separate agency is needed to ensure better cooperation between the energy regulators in the Member States. There has been a significant proliferation of agencies within the EU in recent years and we should not be adding to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as transparency is concerned, there are a number of factors to be taken into consideration. On the one hand, reductions in the wholesale prices are often not passed on to consumers by the electricity and gas suppliers or only very slowly. On the other hand, consumers cannot benefit from the deregulation of the energy markets while incomprehensible energy bills make it so difficult to change supplier. In addition, there is no genuine comparability when the comparison websites list only those suppliers which have reached an agreement on paying commission.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the energy market has not only a trans-European but a regional scope as well. The European Union’s energy markets are increasingly extending beyond national borders, a trend which is set to gain considerable pace in the period ahead. Unfortunately, the system regulating the energy market’s transparency and abuse has created significant discrepancies in terms of applicable regulations and the level of transparency. I think that we need consistent regulations at EU level and a mechanism which will enable the authorities to access information from the whole Union to help gain an in-depth understanding of how the market is evolving.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I recommend taking into account the fact that Europe’s energy markets are organised in regional groups.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, firstly, with this regulation, we are venturing into new territory. Therefore, I cannot say with certainty that all the provisions in the regulation will prove to be 100% practical in 10 years’ time. We are beginning now with a practical test. We believe that the measures we have proposed are correct and we will come back to you with progress reports from the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and from the Commission about whether and where improvements must be made, and whether the regulation should be revised, the instruments improved even further and the measures optimised.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question of why a separate agency is needed has been asked. We have deliberately not proposed a separate agency. Instead, we have commissioned the agency which works together with the national regulators and which was established in March, ACER, to take on this additional responsibility, because there are many overlaps between ACER’s current activities and the new tasks. If ACER had not been given this task, it would have to have been carried out either solely by the national regulators, which would have meant that there would be no pooling of resources or harmonisation of sanctions and that other benefits would have been lost, or by the Commission working together with the Directorate-General. However, Directorates-General perform a management and monitoring function. They are not responsible for day-to-day administration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, like you, I am concerned about the following questions: What positions do we have to create in order to carry out the tasks effectively? What other resources do we need? What IT systems do we require? The agency will now take responsibility for this work. As soon as we know more about the workload, we will be happy to come back to Parliament and to ensure by means of restructuring or authorising the creation of new positions that the agency can cope with the amount of work in a few years and provide the required level of monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question of the establishment of external bodies or liaison offices has been raised. We have currently told the agency and its boards, its director and supervisory bodies that it should decide how it is organised. I do not think that we should have an external body in the capital of every Member State. We will be happy to report at the next opportunity on whether these are needed and, if so, where. However, I am very reluctant to propose external bodies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Remek called the internal market into question, which is a reasonable thing to do. We can once again ask the question: has the internal market in electricity and gas been a sensible development in terms of competition and transparency? It was established 15 years ago by this Parliament. Europe is based on the fundamental principles of the market economy. Alongside the union for peace, the internal market, which has removed trade barriers and borders and allowed for competition and transparency, is a basic tenet of the European idea. There is an internal market for food, cars, white goods, brown goods and for products and services of every kind. The internal market and the trade agreements with third countries have, in principle, brought benefits for Europe. I believe that this means that the internal market is the right basis on which to do business.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is, in principle, also logical to subject not only coal and oil, which have been internal market products for several decades, but also electricity and gas to the rules of the internal market. In addition, if there were no internal market in electricity, but there was a European Union, we would now need a European electricity company. That would be a bureaucratic nightmare. Furthermore, it is only within the internal market that we can work towards our common goals for reducing CO2 emissions and introducing renewable energy. Only in the internal market can we also achieve solidarity among the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not therefore a question of whether the internal market is right, because it is right. Instead, this is about ensuring that it is used correctly and not abused. For this reason, I believe that we have taken a decisive step today towards putting the internal market on a proper, trustworthy footing and, as far as possible, preventing market abuse and attacks on the internal market and on the benefits for market participants, in other words, insider knowledge, in the same way as has been done successfully in the case of other services in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think this debate has shown the importance which all of us and which all the institutions attach to the introduction of instruments to strengthen the functioning of the single energy market. We are involved in the very important but difficult process of building the internal market – and it is a process and not a single event, which is something we all have to bear in mind.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that in particular, it is necessary to call attention here to the time which was needed to reach a compromise between the institutions, particularly in an area so sensitive as the energy market and at a time which is so turbulent as it is now. Of course, we always face a dilemma as to whether we should try to achieve perfect results or go through procedures quickly. I think it is important that particularly today, we proceed quickly and that we do the job well. In this context, I would like to respond to a number of doubts, which were expressed, for example, by Mr Goebbels, Mr Turmes, Mr Swoboda, Mr Paksas and others, concerning sanctioning regimes. We have, in the form of an annex to the text of the regulation, a joint declaration made by the institutions which says that we are going to work together to reinforce the system in the future.</p>

While benefiting from preferential, non-transparent contracts, some companies have been able to purchase energy at rock-bottom prices, which they resell later on at prices up to three times higher.

      <p sl="de">The Treaties provide a proven method of doing this in the form of the Commission, which is the guardian of the Treaties, and which is supposed to monitor the process of applying and implementing European law, including initiating proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation when no agreement can be reached with the Member State in question. This concerns, for example, questions such as the recognition of professional qualifications, which can be very important for the future of individual citizens, or environmental issues and matters relating to the ownership of land and property. These are all things which affect the citizens of Europe directly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission generally acts on the basis of a complaint submitted by a complainant. These citizens who make complaints are, ultimately, and this is very important to me, our early-warning system, which indicates to us that things are going wrong with the application of European legislation in the Member States and which should allow us to take corrective action. For this reason, the complainants play a central role in the entire process. Citizens must have a genuine opportunity to raise complaints and to obtain information about the response made to these complaints and whether there will be consequences and, if not, why not. We are required to do this under our obligation to ensure transparency, under the terms of the Treaties and on the basis of our respect for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, if we had responded rapidly, consistently and strongly to the issue of waste disposal in Campania, we would have been able, in my opinion, to avoid some of the consequences of the situation there in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report also calls into question the activities of the so-called EU Pilot project, where the Commission unfortunately does not always adequately fulfil its obligation to provide information to complainants in the case of a complaint and prefers to negotiate with the Member States behind the scenes. This leaves the citizens who make the complaints out in the cold without any information. That is unacceptable. For this reason, we have included a proposal in my report which allows for at least a partial codification of this process, with fixed deadlines and obligations to provide information. This is clearly in line with the provisions of the Treaties. It does not restrict the Commission in any way, but instead gives it support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to make it clear that, in times of increasing euroscepticism, responding to complaints made by citizens and a transparent process for handling these complaints are more important than ever. I believe that we need to take this into consideration, with all the consequences that it involves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you Commissioner and also the Presidency. I have tried – along with my colleagues – to maintain a constructive approach throughout when compiling my report. At the same time, I make no apologies for self-examination on behalf of this House with a verdict of ‘room for improvement’. May I thank my shadows for their equally constructive approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two questions which run throughout the theme of the report I have produced: why do we need to pursue the smart regulation agenda? And why now? The current economic circumstances are dramatically affecting our businesses and as I speak with them, I find that alongside all the traditional difficulties and challenges that they have had, they face specific and particular ones today such as raising capital in the current financial situation and recruiting a talented workforce from within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We as policy makers must do our very best to support these engines of the European economy, yet lamentably, our current regulatory framework continues to stifle business and entrepreneurs seeking to create jobs and growth in Europe. Setting up business in Europe is actually getting too costly and time consuming. Why should it cost four times as much to set up a business in Europe as compared to the US, Brazil or indeed India? In times of highly mobile capital, fast-pace innovation and ever quickening production cycles, the economic cost of holding up business with such bureaucracy is unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our maze of regulation directly affects our citizens, a considerable number of whom have lost their jobs during the financial crisis and are now seeking new opportunities for work, and it is hugely important that new businesses are supported and are able to create new employment. More broadly, the flaws of our current legislative approach only raise doubts in the minds of our citizens. As soon as you leave the bubble of Brussels, most ordinary Europeans find it very difficult to understand what the EU is, and when they see the effects of some of what originates here, they ask: whose side are you on?</p>
      <p sl="en">With such immediate problems, focus undeniably turns to the short and medium-term; yet even greater challenges await Europe in the future. Domestically, we face generation-defining problems in the energy sector and managing the environment together with finding a successful growth model for the 21st century. Many of the issues affect the very fabric that makes up our society, and we must not divide into extremism or disillusionment but come together to find the solutions. These difficult challenges must be met with the best policy responses built up through evidence and consultation so as to ensure that the public can understand and support the solutions which governments and the European Union find.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our attention must not only be focused on ourselves here in Europe – though the rising competitiveness of our neighbours throughout the world makes it essential. We do all we can to support innovation and growth in our economies. With India and China literally breathing down our necks, it is essential that the EU and the Member States take action to create a framework fostering economic competitiveness and promoting growth if we are going to be able to meet this long-term challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe was once the leader in developing ideas and exporting its success across the world. We must remain open for business. We must create a new vision of Europe – one which is seen as a most attractive place to come and work and a place of opportunities, not one of difficulties and complications. I am no advocate of the pull-up, the drawbridge Europe – much to the contrary. Europe must remain open for business. This is why the closing approach to immigration in some of our Member States concerns me. Having spent much time steering the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) through this House, I despair at the obstacles being put in place in some of our Member States. The loss is clearly ours.</p>
      <p sl="en">The approach that we need to adopt is one which needs to be on a joint-approach basis between the Commission, Parliament and Council. I hope you will find much of what is in my report acceptable.</p>

    <intervention id="2-518-000" speaker_id="96815" name="Judith Sargentini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the credit for this report is due, of course, not to me but to Ms Hautala, my former colleague, who is now a member of the Finnish Government. In Ms Hautala, the Finnish Government has obtained a very good minister, but this House has also lost a champion of transparency. It is a privilege for me to have the opportunity to take over the baton from her. The Hautala report – now the Sargentini report – was approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs back in June.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It gained that approval with an overwhelming majority based on a shared awareness that the transparency of European decision making still leaves a great deal to be desired. Too often, the secrecy reflex still prevails, whereas, in fact, transparency must be the presumption. Too often, the citizens must themselves ask to see documents that could have been put online long ago. Too often, people still have to mindlessly trawl through European websites, whereas all the documents that shed light on decision making in a particular area could equally be put together in a clear way. You and I know what that means for us, too. Too often, the Court of Justice and the European Ombudsman have to take Europe’s institutions to task. All of this is despite the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon commits us, more than ever, to the most transparent decision making possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Access to documents and good governance are fundamental rights to which, since the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon, the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union have actually been subject. It thus does not help or, to put it a better way, it is disastrous for European credibility, if the Council nevertheless keeps documents about its part of the legislative process secret. Then we have the fact that there is, curiously, still a Commission proposal on the table concerning the restriction of the definition of ‘documents’ which would make it easier for internal documents to be swept under the carpet. This secrecy impulse runs counter to the Treaty of Lisbon. This resolution thus calls on the Commission to bring forward a new proposal to revise the regulation regarding public access to documents, a proposal that is ‘Lisbon-proof’. I would like to hear a response to this from the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, this House should not hold its breath awaiting serious transparency from the other institutions. We can get to work on this ourselves, as the Hautala/Sargentini resolution also says. At this point in time, the trialogues and conciliation procedures are the most opaque part of the legislative procedure, yet these negotiations are more often than not crucial to the end result obtained. Parliament must thus publish the associated documents in future. That is essential for the press, for civil society and for stakeholders amongst the general public. They have the right to be able to keep close tabs on the legislative process. For the same reason, Parliament’s committees must hold at least one orientation vote before they turn to a trialogue with the Council and the Commission. That should be laid down as mandatory in our Rules of Procedure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the debt crisis is putting confidence in the European Union under severe pressure. I advise the institutions and the Member States not to break any more promises. We need to realise the promise of maximum transparency, and time is pressing.</p>

    <intervention id="2-519-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maciej Szpunar" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I very much welcome Parliament’s proposal to hold a debate on the subject of better law making. This subject is a matter of interest to both colegislators alike – to the Council as well as to Parliament. I would also like to express my esteem for the authors of each of the reports which have provided the basis for today’s debate. A particular source of encouragement is the fact that the House attaches such great importance to the question of making better legislation, both at European and at national level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like, firstly, to say a few words about the report drafted by Ms Lichtenberger on the annual report on monitoring the application of European Union law. A few words, because this monitoring is primarily the domain of the Commission, not the Council. The Council certainly shares many of the reservations expressed in the report, and these reservations do not concern exclusively the fact that infringements of European law occur too often, just as we are too often faced with the late transposition of laws. It should also be remembered that in fact, the Commission should first of all carry out monitoring and, if need be, require clarifications from the Member States. I am sure that Mr Šefčovič will want to develop this subject in his speech.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In his report on better legislation, subsidiarity and proportionality, and smart regulation, Mr Karim rightly observes that by means of its Communication on Smart Regulation in the European Union, the Commission is trying to ensure that these regulations play a more central role in European policy formulation. The Council fully shares the favourable opinion presented in this report on the subject of a new agenda for smart regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In its conclusions of 30 May 2011, the Council stressed the importance of the question of stimulating competitiveness and growth. This is an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy. We are convinced that by placing emphasis on the entire legislative process, it will be possible to have a more comprehensive approach to better law making. It will also be possible for the work of legislators to be more closely related to the needs of society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Naturally, as colegislators, we are working towards the same objectives. The challenges we face are often the same. The laws we make must improve the life of our citizens, contributing to their prosperity and supporting economic growth. In our work, we often have to try to find a balance between different obligations which are frequently difficult to reconcile. This means that legislation at European level, perhaps even more often than legislation at national level, is the result of compromise, and a compromise does not always offer a guarantee that what it produces will meet what is required of it in terms of clarity and brevity. If we are to maintain the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, if we are to comply with the principle of ‘think small first’, if we want our work to bring about a reduction in administrative burdens and we also want it to result in clearer legislation, we have to demonstrate a high degree of self-discipline. The critical moment comes when Members of the House draft amendments in committee and ministers present the views and positions of their countries in the Council. It is precisely at this moment – during work in committee and at meetings of the Council – that we should particularly remember our objectives in relation to better law making.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would also like to say a few words about the report drafted by Ms Sargentini, who has completed the work begun by Ms Hautala. This report is about public access to documents and transparency. Both reports contain many interesting suggestions. This matter is a crucial one. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, access to documents became a fundamental right of every citizen of the Union, and also of every natural or legal person residing in a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A variety of criticisms are often made of the Council, so what is the situation with the Council’s documents? Well, at the end of 2010, the public register of the Council’s documents contained over 1.5 million items. Over 75% of those documents could have been made publicly available. In comparison to 2009, this means an increase of around 12% in the number of documents made directly available by the register. In terms of requests for public access, the General Secretariat of the Council gave consideration to over 9 000 documents in 2010. In the case of over 70% of these, a decision was made to grant access to the whole of the document. Work is currently under way on two Commission proposals, made in 2008 and 2011 respectively, for revision of Regulation No 1049/2001. We are closely following the work being done in Parliament on these two proposals, so that we will be able to respond when Parliament adopts its position. At the present moment, we are conducting preliminary discussions on the 2011 proposal. We hope that soon we will be able to agree a general approach, which will facilitate dialogue with Parliament. Our main objective is constructive cooperation with Parliament, so that we are able to achieve our aim of adopting an amended regulation. This is in the interest of the whole of society and is for the common good.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will do my best to react as quickly as possible to the three reports, which have been presented to the plenary, and also to Mr Szpunar’s remarks on behalf of the Polish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to state my clear appreciation of the three reports that we are debating today. It is important that the institutions work together on these topics, which are so important if we want to make EU legislative and political action more transparent, more accessible and more useful for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for better legislation, subsidiarity and proportionality, and smart regulation, I am very happy to learn that Mr Karim’s report supports our agenda and underlines the shared responsibility of the EU institutions in this area. Smart regulation is a key priority for the Commission and we have an ambitious smart regulation agenda with clearly defined priorities. The Commission remains committed to further improving the quality of its initiatives and to evaluating existing legislation, as well as continuing to reduce administrative burdens and simplifying wherever possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, the Commission is on track to exceed its target of 25% of administrative burden reductions by 2012. We now need to ensure that this translates into concrete benefits for businesses through the adoption of relevant legislation by the Council and Parliament and by effective implementation in the Member States. The delivery of this target by 2012 must be our common priority within a broader approach to legislation to make it more efficient and effective. To this end, we also make thorough use of impact assessments in the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another key tool in this new approach will be the systematic ex-post evaluation of the legislation. The Commission has therefore merged its efforts to reduce administrative burdens with those to simplify and to evaluate legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission welcomes an open discussion on the responsibility of the three institutions in delivering smart regulation. We need to ensure that all three institutions show a commitment to making real progress. They should start by making the best use of existing instruments. Therefore, the Commission calls for the full implementation of the current interinstitutional agreement on better law making.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning now to the application of EU law, I would first like to thank Members for the preparatory work on our annual report on the monitoring of the application of EU law. As the current interinstitutional talks on correlation tables demonstrate, the Commission and Parliament attach great importance to the current application of EU law. I appreciate the opportunity to have an exchange of views on a regular basis on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Szpunar for his personal involvement and commitment to resolving the issue we are discussing now concerning correlation tables and explanatory information from the Member States to the Commission so that we can do our work better in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the issues raised in Ms Lichtenberger’s report, I would like to highlight the following points. In 2007, we announced that we would improve and intensify our collaboration with the Member States. Therefore, in 2008, we introduced the EU Pilot project and I am happy to say that nearly all Member States are participating. This instrument is an early-warning and problem-solving tool vis-à-vis Member States in many cases. It does not replace the infringement procedure but helps to resolve a lot of cases. Those that cannot be resolved are, of course, put into the infringement procedure. The EU Pilot gives full and quick effect to Union law for the benefit of citizens and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I am sure we will discuss later today, petitions to Parliament are key in identifying citizens’ concerns. The annual report analyses in detail the nature of petitions and gives concrete examples where they have also triggered infringement procedures. In order to improve the follow-up to complaints, we have set up an effective complaint registration system. I am confident that the system meets the concerns previously spelled out by Parliament and the Ombudsman. It allows the rapid treatment of incoming complaints and gives swift information to the complainants about any major step decided by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the role of the Commission with regard to the late transposition of directives by the Member States. In 2010, the Commission explained publicly the concrete ways in which it will apply these new powers. This was communicated to the other institutions as well. We are confident that this contributes to putting further pressure on Member States to improve their performance in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, Ms Sargentini’s report clearly shows the importance of public access to documents as a central element of the transparency of the work of the institutions. The report contains useful suggestions which the Commission will duly take into consideration. In particular, the Commission agrees that the information should be made available to the public in a proactive manner whenever possible. The Commission has already made significant efforts in this respect. For example, information and documents on comitology committees and on expert groups are available through dedicated websites. The Commission also provides information on beneficiaries of EU funds, both under central and shared management, and for the latter, information on beneficiaries of funds is accessible through a portal providing links with national websites.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the Commission shares Parliament’s wish to improve the interoperability of the public registers, and we still have a lot of work to do on this, but the Commission takes note of the rapporteur’s comments concerning the ongoing legislative procedure on a recast of the access to documents regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this debate cannot replace the ongoing legislative process. In this regard, let me underline that our proposal for a recast does not reduce the level of transparency. Our estimation is that the same number of requests for access would be granted. Our proposal merely aims at clarifying a number of provisions and at facilitating the application of the regulation. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that some changes to the regulation are made necessary by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, most importantly, the extension of the citizen’s right to access the documents of all EU institutions and bodies. This would include, for example, the European Council and the EAS.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, the Commission decided last March to submit a second proposal to align the existing regulation to the Treaty. Our objective with the second proposal is to give citizens the rights the Treaty has created for them, and to do so as quickly as possible without waiting for the conclusion of the discussions on the wider recast proposal. The Commission therefore invites Parliament and the Council to adopt quickly the proposal aligning the regulations to the Treaty and, in parallel, we will continue our discussions on the wider recast proposal. We look forward to relaunching the legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, debate should focus on the core issues, such as the definition of the ‘space to think’ within the institutions and the balance between the protection of personal data and the right of access to documents, which have been rightly highlighted by the rapporteur. Other issues such as classification rules or historical archives should not be addressed in this context, but rather in specific fora.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to repeat the Commission’s appreciation of these three reports, which contain very useful observations and suggestions. I now look forward to deepening this debate with you and I thank you in advance for your remarks.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, representatives of the Council, Mr Szpunar, Commissioner Šefčovič, first of all, I should like to establish that I shall be speaking here in a dual capacity. Firstly, I am deputising for the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Messerschmidt, who is absent because the elections are under way in Denmark at the moment and I am, therefore, representing him as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. However, I am also here as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and as shadow rapporteur for this report in the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first point I should like to make is that, in the crisis in which we find ourselves, the economic and financial crisis, smart regulation and better legislation is a central issue. There is no doubt that improving the level of legislation and regulation is also an absolutely essential part of the so-called ‘structural reforms’ that can trigger the financial and economic recovery of the European area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is clear that a Europe that wants, on the one hand, to be dynamic and competitive, must have regulation that is simple and accessible to companies, and, of course, to citizens, and must be devoted to their needs. The fact is that today, it is therefore essential, first of all, that the first programme of reducing administrative burdens is passed; that every effort be made to promote the consultation of market operators, and of associations representing individuals and companies; and that there be an impact assessment of the legislation itself – this is also extremely important in order for the decision-making process to be essentially founded on, let us say, the very opinions of the people the legislation is intended for, and so that it can be carried out without unnecessary administrative burdens and with lower economic and financial costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important to say that, for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in particular, the concept of the principle of proportionality and subsidiarity is important; this concept that European intervention should be appropriate and not complicate the legal and regulatory systems further. That is why, in our opinion, we pay particular attention to the strengthened role that the national parliaments now have, precisely because of the principle of proportionality and the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is now therefore essential to involve the national parliaments in both smart regulation and better legislation, so that both legislation and regulation will be more streamlined, smarter and more effective, at both European and national level. It is therefore a good time for us to put into practice what we discuss every day, which is a Europe that is more competitive and more streamlined through smarter regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few months ago, this House endorsed a set of key measures to relaunch the single market, and I strongly believe that the ambitious goals we have set will be impossible to achieve without ensuring proper application of EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate Ms Lichtenberger on the good work that she has done. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection was happy to see that some progress has been made in some areas, such as late transposition of directives or the improvement in the functioning of Solvit. However, a lot more remains to be done to ensure that businesses and citizens fully benefit from the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States should incentivise their responsible government departments to ensure timely transposition. Correlation tables are another useful tool that would contribute to a better transposition process, and I really hope that Member States will show their commitment to proper implementation by accepting to draw up such tables. Infringement procedures need to be shorter and more transparent so that citizens remain fully informed about the follow-up to their requests, and we should continue to support and develop problem-solving tools like Solvit and EU Pilot.</p>

    <intervention id="2-523-000" speaker_id="96748" name="Cornelis de Jong" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I will begin with the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for whom I am the rapporteur, and then move on to the Sargentini report, for which I am the shadow rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection relates to the Karim report. In Rotterdam, where I live, I am in regular contact with a number of retailers’ associations. They act as a sounding board for me. Every time I come across legislative proposals that might have consequences for the self-employed, I talk to them. Thus, for example, I want to find out from them if the proposals currently under discussion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are feasible. The proposals concern substances that can be sold in shops but that could also be used for terrorist purposes. I ask questions such as ‘How can a retailer recognise these substances?’ and ‘How can they check the validity of permits that clients may soon require in order to be able to purchase these substances?’ It is an example of a kind of informal SME test.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, the Commission does carry out formal SME tests in the form of impact assessments, but it gives SMEs far too little influence in the preceding phase. This is the case in the expert groups, for example, as the costs that the self-employed incur to participate are not compensated for. The questionnaires, too, are still a concern, as the Commission is making them too complicated, while it is unclear to the self-employed what exactly happens to their contributions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To the rapporteur, Mr Karim, I offer my sincere thanks for taking up the proposal that we brought forward in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, namely, the adoption of a mandatory SME test for this House once legislative proposals have been adopted in Parliament’s committees, and before the vote in plenary. I hope that, after this excellent report is adopted, the Bureau quickly picks up the proposal and that we can put this procedure into place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will turn now to the Sargentini report on access to documents. I receive complaints on a daily basis about how difficult it is to find reliable information about the goings-on in Brussels. The search functions on the European institutions’ websites never give you the answer to your question and, in any case, the websites are organised based on the structure of the institutions, not based on the questions that resonate with the public.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, it is scarcely believable that, in 2011, the Commission is more reticent in the provision of information in connection with its proposals than it was in 2001. I am, furthermore, really angry with the Commissioner that, time and again, the Commission refuses to answer our questions about the composition and activities of the expert groups. Even a debate in plenary last time where we asked oral questions, and which Mr Šefčovič was not able to attend in person and so sent Mr Karas to deputise, did not give rise to clarity. We did not get an answer to a single question. This blemishes our democracy directly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Council, too, refuses to allow citizens a look into the decision-making process. While, as a result of the euro crisis, everyone is talking about Europe at the moment, the citizens are getting no information about how things are really being done during the negotiations about the euro. As Ms Sargentini said already, it is only through the occasional posting on Twitter that I get to read about the negotiations and trialogues. Furthermore, these remain a kind of black box.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To my mind, the European Parliament should refuse to participate in back-room politics and should make the documents public. Negotiations can best take place in the open, or else there should at the very least be a requirement to provide an update on the state of play after each round of negotiations. All of these elements are also taken up in the Sargentini report, and I hope that that, too, will be adopted with consensus.</p>

      <p sl="da">The citizens and their active participation are, of course, important prerequisites for compliance with legislation. Without these it is impossible, in fact, and I would like to follow up on a very important point, the responsibility for which lies with us and for which I have, fortunately, attained support from the majority, and that is the infringement procedures. It is unreasonable for citizens not to be able to see what happens when responses come from the Commission and when the Member States then respond in turn. A prerequisite for our ability to meet the requirements of the Aarhus Convention, as well as to keep the promises made in the Treaty is, of course, that we have proper, transparent public access to documents. Ms Sargentini’s report also relates to improving this situation.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to mention that we are pleased – I am pleased that I have obtained majority support in this regard – once again to hear what Ms Lichtenberger said about the importance of having clear and proper procedures for how these reports are debated and how we ensure that we achieve transparency.

It highlights that, in spite of a fall in the number of infringement cases opened by the Commission, the Committee on Petitions settled around 2 900 complaints and infringement cases by the end of 2009, and that Member States were still behind schedule with their transposition of directives in more than half of cases.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission should bring greater transparency to ongoing procedures involving infringement of Union legislation and inform EU citizens as soon as possible, and in an appropriate manner, of the action taken at their request. The step taken by the rapporteur in calling on the Commission to propose a procedural law in the form of a regulation under the new legal basis of Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is appropriate and I endorse it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is deplorable that too many procedures involving infringement of Union legislation need a long time to be closed or brought before the Court of Justice. This is why Member States and the Commission should step up their efforts to remedy the causes of legislative infringements. I would welcome the Commission prioritising infringements of Union legislation in different sectors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We notice that there is still a high number of cases involving infringement of Union legislation due to late transposition of directives. The timely transposition of EU directives is crucial to the smooth functioning of the single market for the benefit of consumers and businesses in the Union. For these reasons, I welcome the request made by the Commission and the rapporteur to continue to promote best practices in terms of transposing single market legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as I was the rapporteur for last year’s report on better legislation and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, I paid particular attention to the question of transparency and whether legislation which is made can be understood by the citizens, as well as to ex post evaluation or meticulous follow-up of what happens to EU law after it is passed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore support the proposals presented in the report concerning the need to study the impact of legislation, correct deviations and replicate successful initiatives, the need to simplify EU legislation, and the need to avoid drawing up acts unless they are specifically needed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I am still opposed to the principle proposed by the rapporteur of ‘one-in, one-out’, which allows for new legislation only on condition that some earlier pieces of legislation are removed. In practice, this is simply not possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Reducing administrative burdens and simplifying law must not also lead to a reduction in the standards provided for in current legislation. I think it is necessary to intensify efforts and be more ambitious, if the target of reducing administrative burdens by 25% by 2012 is to be reached.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also worth remembering the regulation on the European Citizens’ Initiative, which entered into force on 1 April 2011, creating the opportunity for ordinary citizens to participate in creating better legislation. All of these things have to be taken into account if we want to see true change and improvement in the area of formulating good and comprehensible legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for a very good piece of work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating all three rapporteurs. All the reports try to explain how we can improve our legislative process. Post-Lisbon, that is a duty that is incumbent upon all three of our institutions plus national parliaments. EU law – EU legislation – is our product and we all, together, have to get it right. The making of EU law must be done transparently and openly so that our citizens and businesses can easily participate in the process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say something about how I imagine the best legislative process. It would start with open consultation and participation possible for all. There would be impact assessment. We would then see a simple understandable citizens’ summary so that everybody can see what is proposed by the legislation. We would then have an amendment process that can be easily followed electronically through all our institutions in the same way, so that our citizens can participate. We would have transparency of the lobbying process, which we are beginning to obtain by our work on the joint register.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we reach final agreement on legislation, we have to show exactly what that is. There has been talk of ‘legislative summaries’ but, more importantly, we will need correlation tables or the equivalent to show how the implementation process is working and to make sure that, when our businesses and citizens want to enforce, they are able to do so simply and easily.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is my dream. I hope one day to see the reality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my very warm thanks to Ms Lichtenberger, Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini. Time is short, so I will keep my comments on this subject brief. Information, access to information and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy. Without complete transparency and without access to this information, democracy cannot function. We have to constantly remind ourselves that these are not our concerns which are being discussed in the Commission, in the Council and also here in Parliament. The Council is not dealing with its own concerns, but with those of the citizens and it needs to behave accordingly, in other words, everything must be made public. The same thing applies to the other documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to raise one particular point in relation to the so-called EU Pilot project. This acts rather like the wall in a squash game. The citizens who have not been able to obtain a satisfactory result within their own Member State turn to the Commission and the Commission hits the ball back into the court of the Member State. However, what is lacking is a clear follow-up of each case, which would enable specific decisions to be made by the Commission and also sanctions to be imposed. What we need is a set of comprehensive rules that make a real impact and that ultimately also have legal consequences.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to thank all of the rapporteurs and, in particular, my colleague, Sajjad Karim, for an excellent report and for the work done. I share the grave concerns over the fact that the Commission has failed in its resolve to reduce the administrative burden by a planned 25% by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am therefore placing very high hopes on the Edmund Stoiber group, the mandate of which has been extended to the end of 2012. In November this year, the group should publish a fundamental report on best practices and the simplest way to implement European law in the Member States. The report should accelerate the process of cutting down on bureaucracy, so that we can achieve the original aim of reducing the administrative burden.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The main obstacle to reducing bureaucracy and the administrative burden is no longer the Commission itself, but the European Parliament and the Member States, who lack qualified, systematic support for the implementation of European law. In my opinion, the Commission finds the European Parliament lacking as a strong partner in the fight against bureaucracy. We should therefore consider setting up a European Parliament committee on eliminating the bureaucratic burden.</p>

While their MEPs in Europe tell the public they want to end needless EU laws, their government continues to heap more of them on British businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fundamental weakness of EU regulation is the assumption that one size fits all. This is not the case. Each Member State has its own social and economic realities. Repeated attempts at harmonisation are making the situation worse, not better.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bottom line is this. Do these reports reduce red tape? No, of course not. There is no such thing as better EU regulation; only more EU red tape.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would prefer for there to be no European legislation at all. Let there be no doubt about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a procedural problem is that individual legislators sometimes have difficulty in taking rational, informed decisions. I believe that this difficulty is knowingly, if not deliberately, created and perpetuated. Amendments are changed or regrouped at the last possible moment by agreement among the party leaders. Individual members of the large party groups are oblivious to these changes and do not need to know of them. They are simply told by their party leaders how to vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">We non-attached Members do not enjoy that doubtful privilege, and nor does any large-party MEP of independent mind. We, with our assistants, must take all of our decisions ourselves. It is difficult enough to have the amendments 24 hours before the vote. However, we frequently receive regrouped amendments on the day of the vote. What we need is an improvement in the procedure of passing legislation. That would be a necessary, though not of course a sufficient, condition for better legislation to emerge.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to say to the previous speaker that the way in which he works is very interesting! The German constitution prevents us from being exposed to outside influence. No one can tell us how we should vote. However, the situation in other Member States seems to be different. Perhaps the problem concerns transparency, which can always be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are very much concerned here with improving transparency in the European Union and, in particular, with regard to the European institutions, so that the citizens can gain a better understanding of Europe and are better able to comprehend what goes on here and perhaps even to express their opinions at the right stage of the legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are doing an excellent job of dealing with this, which is just the right sort of transparency. How far do we need to go? Do we have to make public everything that is said here and take minutes on every occasion? I believe that it would then no longer be possible to implement any policies. Of course, the decisions and the debates must be publicised, but all of us who have been involved in politics for many years are aware that we also have sensitive discussions which we cannot necessarily disclose. One example is the trialogue negotiations, which concern specialist legislation. If we were to make public the content of the trialogue negotiations, this could, under certain circumstances, lead to the negotiations being blocked, because they would be exposed to external influences in the form of lobbying, for example. This could be an extremely risky business.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the right thing to do? What is a document? Do we have to publish all our documents or is this just about information? Does it only concern the legislative process or does it also relate to information from procedures which take place in the administrative bodies of the institutions in the European Union? This is what we are currently discussing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite all the initial difficulties, we have managed to reach a good compromise and to come to an agreement on Ms Hautala’s report, which Ms Sargentini has been kind enough to take over. This makes me very hopeful that we will also be successful in future in the case of Mr Cashman’s forthcoming report and that we will be able to agree and to find the right definitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is information? What is a document? What are the things which it is important that we should publicise? We all know, if we are honest with one another, that inundating the public with information has exactly the opposite result to transparency, in other words, people no longer understand anything, because they can no longer filter out the essential details.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, I would like to thank everyone involved for making it possible to reach a good compromise. I hope that we can continue working in this way in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Szpunar, Commissioner Šefčovič, the process of drawing up EU legislation is far from simple. On the contrary, it is very difficult for ordinary citizens to understand the circuitous routes by which European law is drafted, implemented and complied with. I regard smart regulation or intelligent legislation as the equivalent of a match won by a good football team. The interaction between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council must be harmonious, quick and well-organised. It must also be cost-effective and, above all, democratic. This means that the national parliaments, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), the Committee of the Regions, civil society and, I would like to emphasise this point, the two sides of industry must be included to an adequate extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is one shortcoming in Mr Karim’s otherwise excellent report. It does not refer to the two sides of industry. Social dialogue is enshrined in primary EU legislation. The report simply refers to the fact that all relevant stakeholders must be consulted. This does not take sufficient account of the special nature of trade unions and also of employers’ organisations. The two sides of industry can ultimately also be legislators at an EU level, for example, by means of social partners’ agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to look at a second aspect of this. Smart regulation must not be used to water down the EU’s minimum standards, in particular, with regard to employee protection, so that existing standards can be quickly lowered almost in passing.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to say that today’s debate is perhaps one of the most important debates of this part-session. The questions are hardly new. How should we better meet citizens’ demands for well-considered legislation, based on sound studies and impact assessments, so that we actually solve their problems? This clearly has to be done by means of a legislative process that is open and transparent. There are many challenges involved, and we are a long way from our goal.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Instead of opening up our institutions and increasing our citizens’ access to documents, the Commission and large parts of the Council now seem to want to restrict access to what are really public documents. This is unheard of. We must never forget who it is that we represent. It is the citizens in our Member States. What right do bureaucrats and politicians have to keep secret what we quite probably should regard as the citizens’ own documents? After all, we are not the ones who own these documents; they are owned by the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am also astounded by the strong opposition from representatives of the Council to the introduction of correlation tables. If we are now taking an extremely long time to agree on directives, it is perhaps not so strange for us to want a simple method of seeing how citizens implement these provisions in their Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When it comes to better legislation, we have a great deal to do. Sometimes it seems as if we are experts at talking enthusiastically about the principle of simplifying regulations only then to make things more difficult for our citizens instead. Independent facts, impact assessments and increased opportunities for Members to request studies from the library, for example, could provide important contributions to this process.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to remind you of the excellent report by Ms Niebler on precisely this subject of impact assessments before I conclude by thanking her and Ms Lichtenberger, Mr Karim and Ms Sargentini for their equally excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to hear the Commission propose new rules on transparency. We are certainly in need of them. That is the best protection against corruption and all kinds of abuses of power. It must never be the case that we use the classification of a document as confidential in order to keep uncomfortable audit reports secret or to redefine documents in order to avoid transparency or, as in the case of the ACTA Agreement, to classify something as confidential because we are scared of a public debate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Something that I would really like to be part of the public’s access to documents is for all documents to actually be registered. Good examples include first reading agreements that are reached behind closed doors and cases where we hardly have any rules regarding transparency and openness. Another example is the documents received from lobbyists. Lobbyists should always be required to send a copy to a public register, so that citizens can see who is influencing what legislation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Classification as confidential must never be used to protect inhumane or stupid decisions. That would undermine citizens’ confidence in democracy. It should be used in well-considered, specific cases, but never as an instrument of this kind.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the principle of subsidiarity may be enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, but it remains a theory. I would like to give just a few examples of this. According to the flexibility clause in Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU can enact regulations without the agreement of the national parliaments, if this helps to achieve the goals of the Treaties. Hear, hear! The Treaty of Lisbon has introduced clauses based on the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle, simplified procedures and more majority decisions in the Council in order to rush through certain matters. The so-called passerelle clause, Article 311, gives the EU the opportunity and the right to raise its own taxes.</p>
      <p sl="de">What has happened to subsidiarity? We will only have better legislation when it is drawn up in the place where it belongs, in other words, in the institutions directly elected by the people, which are the European Parliament and, in particular, of course, the national parliaments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when speaking of better legislation, we must first and foremost remember that it all starts here, in the EU institutions, and so also in the European Parliament. We can and, of course, should call Member States to account for delays or mistakes or for enacting complicated supplementary legislation when implementing particular directives, or for imposing more restrictive demands in national legislation than those which are, in fact, contained in EU legislation. First, however, we must ourselves give attention to those elements of the legislative process which we can improve ourselves, so that the legislation we make is better.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The smart regulation which Mr Karim talks about in his report is not just clear and well-written legislation, it is legislation which is passed on the basis of precise and independent impact assessments which have been consulted with all interested parties. An extremely graphic and oft-quoted example is the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the EU market. The importance of the work of these small firms for the development of the single market and the European economy cannot be overestimated. However, it is precisely these firms, these enterprises, which continue to experience a certain ignorance on the part of the legislator; they still face costs and administrative burdens which are too high and their situation is still too infrequently taken into account in the law-making process, although the Small Business Act does call for this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We continually talk about the financial crisis troubling Europe. I think, however, that this is the last thing we should be doing at the moment, and that we should stop just talking about the need to improve the legal environment of small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises and put this legislation into effect. Anyone can make a mistake, but we should learn to draw the right lessons from our mistakes.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Treaty on European Union enables citizens to participate in the decision-making process, and thus to exercise public scrutiny, thereby guaranteeing the legitimacy of the democratic political system. The Commission produced a proposal to update the regulation on public access to documents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission in 2008. The amendments proposed by the Commission do not, however, improve accessibility to institutional documents. The inappropriate definition of what falls under the concept of a ‘document’ limits the scope of accessible data and is thus contrary to the Treaty of Lisbon. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to revise its proposals, and I also firmly believe that it is possible to make progress with the legislative process. The public would thus be much better informed if parliamentary committees, prior to negotiating, adopted orientation votes and the Council published the negotiation position agreed within the framework of Coreper.</p>

      <p sl="it">We are on the right track, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, there is great resistance when we talk about transparency. In my opinion, there is no middle way: anyone against full transparency obviously has something to hide and would prefer for decisions to be taken out of sight from citizens and the press.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission refuses to accept the proposals to revise the regulation on access to documents, which were put forward by Parliament in the report by Mr Cashman and provide for greater transparency. The Council, meanwhile, systematically refuses to make the identities of Member States known during discussions and votes in their meetings. The legal services of the Commission, the Council and Parliament continue to use excuses to hide their legal opinions, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Turco case.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, leading economists are agreed that the main problems of the European market are, in particular, over-regulation and administrative, bureaucratic and legislative obstacles, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead of creating a friendly environment for business and supporting human activity, we are on the way to becoming world leaders in all-round regulation. This can be seen, for example, in the EU’s effort to regulate so-called cookies, by which, paradoxically, I do not mean biscuits, but information on Internet users stored in the temporary memory of a computer.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The question most often raised over what next to regulate in European politics, and what not, nonetheless fails to get to the heart of the problem, in my opinion.

      <p sl="en">The title is interesting. What is better regulation? It is legislation that is clear, precise and that is understood by all participants. Equally, it is legislation that anyone can influence and not just those who have special access and special knowledge. That is why I am pleased to say that the Hautala/Sargentini report is one that I can so easily pick up and replicate in the revision of the regulation on public access to documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is much more balanced than the report on 2008. It is realistic. The main point is that transparency is a fundamental right. It is there within the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is reinforced by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Lisbon, Regulation No 1049/2001 now applies to all the institutions, the bodies and the agencies set up by them, including the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, I believe, has already produced two proposals on my revision. It should now produce a third, and not just maintain the two. It should produce a third based on the work that Parliament has already done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, in our amendments of 2008, we ‘Lisbonised’ the revision of the regulation. So let us work together. We need common rules on classification; we need precise definitions, as Mrs Sommer said earlier, on, for instance, the space to think. If we are to protect the way the institutions function effectively, let us be clear on what the definition is. Let us be clear on the definition of a document. I have to say we do not – the Parliament in its entirety does not – accept the new concept of a document as proposed in the Commission’s previous recasting of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do need common rules on classification of documents because, unless there are common rules, we will never have coherence on access.</p>

I therefore have three points concerning improvements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The first concerns methodology. Take, for example, the way in which amendments are made. They are often based on national sentiments, but ultimately, they make the legislation complex and unreadable. Secondly, we still base 80% of our European legislation on directives, which ultimately lead to a patchwork situation at national level when it comes to transposition as a result of late transposition, or differences in transposition between different Member States. I advocate involving many experts and basing more legislation on regulations, which have direct effect and ensure more of a level playing field.

      <p sl="es">Lastly, I should once again like to remind Member States of the need to establish correlation tables. All this will help to improve control, transparency and quality.</p>

      <p sl="it">I shall restrict myself to highlighting a number of aspects which I think are especially significant: it is absolutely essential to achieve a 25% cut in red tape, which can only be achieved through greater collaboration between the Commission and the Member States on measures designed to avoid diverging interpretations and the resulting ‘gold-plating’ of transposed legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the same objective in mind, we need to ensure high quality correlation tables between directives and national transposition measures and we need to carry out retrospective assessments of the legislation implemented on a more frequent basis. These are essential measures for ensuring that EU legislation achieves its primary goal, which is meeting the expectations of EU citizens, the businesses operating on the single market, and national and local governments.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, intelligible and clear legislation is more accessible, thus guaranteeing the more effective application in law of rights and responsibilities. The smart regulation initiative in the EU is therefore clearly a step in the right direction. In my experience, the basis for the better operation of European legislation remains effective communication on legislative proposals and on the legislative process directly with the recipients of the legislation, in other words, private citizens and businesses. For this reason, there should be a strengthening of regular and open communication with representatives of civil society, which, in my view, should inspire regular involvement in law making and public events in general on the regional and national level, as well as at much more remote levels, and at the European level. I see that I must end now, but I would just like to congratulate the Vice-President for the fact that, just as he announced in January that he would push hard for the smart regulation agenda, we now have it on the table, and I believe we will achieve good result.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, it appears that the targets the European Commission set out in 2007 in relation to reducing red tape by 25% by 2012 will not be achieved. Last year in this House, while the President of the Commission was giving a speech in relation to the state of the Union, Mr Barroso said that the Commission had published proposals in relation to saving EUR 38 billion for European companies through reductions in this red tape.</p>
      <p sl="ga">While the President may have made this commitment in good faith, he now has an obligation to follow this through and prove his commitment; and action is required. The effect of unnecessary and over-the-top legislation on all companies – but particularly SMEs, the backbone of business and employment in this Union – is immense. The bottom line is that the Commission must step up its game and must redouble its efforts in order to reduce the administrative burden on the SME sector in Ireland and Europe at present.</p>

      <p sl="en">We overcomplicate, we sometimes table amendments that are not clear, and the tragedy is that the words that are finally voted on and agreed between the Commission, the Council and Parliament are words that are then implemented in Member States in national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes that is done haphazardly and slowly, but usually these things come to pass. I think there is an onus on us to legislate better in this House. I know that journalists who come here find it very difficult to follow or indeed read the various reports that come before us. I know that I have been here seven years now, but in the first year in this Parliament, there was no induction into drafting or amending legislation, so we need to look at how we do business ourselves and make the process better.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members for a very good debate which once again demonstrates the importance we all attach to better regulation and implementation of the law for the proper functioning of the European Union. I would also like to thank all of you for your strong commitment to better regulation, transparency and a reduction of the administrative burden. I would like to assure you that all these goals are fully shared by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reaction to some of the interventions and comments, I would like to underline that smart regulation remains a key priority for the Commission. We have a very ambitious agenda with clearly defined priorities, many of which are reflected in the report. We are fully aware of the climate in which we are living, the serious crisis and the need for measures to make life for businesses, and especially SMEs, much easier. We know that in this way we can also contribute to a situation where we will return to a Europe of growth and new job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to smart regulation, I have already described some aspects in my introductory remarks. Some of you mentioned the need to consult the final consumers – the citizens and businesses. We really do that. We have a very extensive programme of public consultations. We have even extended the period in which citizens or businesses can communicate with us and can comment on our proposals from 8 to 12 weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding SMEs and Mr de Jong’s comments, I would like to assure him and all of you that we are fully committed to following up on the June 2011 European Council conclusions that requested the further reduction of the regulatory burden on SMEs. The SME test we have in the Commission is very thorough, and we have suggested several proposals on this matter to the Council. I have to say that some of them have been too difficult for the Council to adopt, so we will further continue the discussion with the Council on how to reduce administrative burdens for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to assure Mr Kožušník from the Czech Republic that we will meet the target of a 25% reduction in the administrative burden. We will actually exceed it because, according to our calculations, we have already put on the table proposals which would reduce the administrative burden by 31%. For that, we need the collaboration of this Parliament and of the Council and, of course, we need appropriate implementation in the Member States. We can make the proposals but the work must be done where the law is applied in the Member States. We hope that we will be very successful in this indeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding Ms Geringer de Oedenberg’s comments and her reluctant position on the ‘one regulatory measure in, one out’ approach, here in Europe, we are overshooting this target. Very often, through our legislation, we put one in and we get 27 out, because we are actually replacing legislation at the national level. Very often it is much more efficient to legislate at European level, because it is much better and it brings many economies and a lot of coherence into the single market of the European Union. We should look at each piece of legislation on a case-by-case basis, via a solid impact assessment. I believe that this would definitely be an optimal approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many honourable Members of the European Parliament commented on access to documents. Here I should start by clarifying what I see as a misunderstanding. The Commission’s proposal on access to documents did not have the intention of decreasing the level of transparency. On the contrary, and to give an example on the topical issue of the definition of documents, the Commission’s proposal has been misunderstood as limiting the scope of official documents mentioned in the public registers. This is absolutely not the case. The existing wide definition of documents is maintained, and is only being clarified. This clarification should help identify documents much more rapidly, and thus I believe deliver more transparency rather than less.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important point, mentioned by Ms Sommer, is the proposal to ensure space to think. All institutions and bodies must have the ability to reflect on the possible policy options before taking the decision. This was another proposal we made when we were presenting our proposal for this area. I would like to assure you that the Commission invests a great deal in the examination of requests for information and in granting access when appropriate. We are promoting transparency in all our activities and each Commission department has a dedicated member of staff in charge of coordinating the application of access to documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude on access to documents, I would like to invite Parliament to consider a twin-track approach: firstly relaunching the legislative process on the recast regulation by concentrating on what really belongs to the fundamental substance of the regulation; and secondly, adopting rapidly the second Commission proposal from last March extending the obligation in terms of access to documents to all EU institutions. I believe that we have to respect the Lisbon Treaty and we have to act quickly because our citizens deserve access to documents and information from other institutions as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last comment is on the proposal for the new procedural court. This is a very sensitive and very important legal question, because under the Treaties, it is the Commission that oversees the application of EU law under the sole control of the Court of Justice. This view is confirmed by the Court’s case-law which we must, of course, all respect. Thus it is for the Commission alone, subject to the authority of the Court of Justice, to organise the way in which it manages infringement proceedings and related work to ensure the correct application of EU law. Therefore, for legal reasons, a regulation based on Article 298 TFEU cannot be used to regulate the specific responsibilities directly conferred by the Treaties upon the Commission in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for a very good discussion. We are very much looking forward to discussing with them further progress in this very important area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the debate on better legislation was about three issues. However, they were related to each other, because they were all about making better laws, so the debate was about three questions which were only different at first glance. All the comments which I have been honoured to hear were extremely interesting and will certainly be taken into account in the work of the Council of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to refer to those three issues – the issues which were the subject of today’s debate. I will begin with the question of access to information. I do, of course, share your fears concerning excessive limitations to access, and I agree with your expectations about making the European Union as transparent as possible. However, it should be remembered that we have to find a balance between transparency in terms of the functioning of the European institutions and the efficiency of their work. I agree fully here with the remarks of Ms Sommer, who highlighted precisely this need to ensure efficiency. It is obvious – and this has been admitted, too, by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its jurisprudence – that not all documents must be made publicly accessible. As an example, I can cite the question of documents forwarded to the Council by the Member States. If we made the documents we receive from the Member States available in full, the Member States would stop sending them, which would, in turn, affect the efficiency of the Council of the European Union and its work. If we are talking about access to documents, I think we should also concentrate on improving access to documents which are not classified as sensitive. Mr Jong rightly pointed out that often, the Internet sites of individual institutions are so unclear that even documents to which there is full access are very difficult for the citizens to find.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I fully agree with the conclusion of the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr Šefčovič, concerning the need to accelerate work on the proposal to recast Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and bring this piece of European legislation into line with the Treaty of Lisbon. As for questions concerning better legislation, there is no doubt – and we are all agreed about this – that a definitive reduction should be made in administrative burdens, chiefly in relation to businesses and against the background of the economic crisis. Stimulating economic growth must be treated as a chance for the Union to get on track for greater and significant economic growth. In this context, I very much agree with Mr Karim’s report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Rangel drew attention to the question of public consultations, and also to the enhanced role of national parliaments which was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. From the Council’s point of view, this is something which is extremely important. It is not only a matter, here, of increasing the legitimacy of what the European Union does by increasing the role of national parliaments, because we must also remember that it is the national parliaments which implement the European legislation we adopt. The earlier we involve the national parliaments in the process of making European Union law, the better will be the results we can expect in terms of the process of implementing that law in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to refer to the question of correlation tables. We think there is a chance of reaching agreement, here. I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič for his contribution. I think that in the course of the next few weeks, we will be able to reach agreement on this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I will make reference to yet one last thing, which is, in principle, the responsibility of the Commission, I mean the application and maintenance of the application of EU law by the Member States. I would just like to add that of course, this House has often pointed to the role of the infringement procedure, in which the Commission brings an action against a Member State in the Court of Justice. Let us remember, however, that the aim of this procedure is not to censure the Member State, but to induce it to implement European Union law correctly. In this context, programmes such as the EU Pilot initiative or the Solvit network are of very great importance. They are also being put into effect with the help of the Member States. The fact that it is possible to bring an end to many infringements before proceedings are instituted is also due to the Member States. Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you all once again for an extremely interesting debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their speeches in this debate. I would also like to give my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their contributions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that a few questions remained unanswered during the course of the answer session. Mr Šefčovič, you were opposed to a proposal for codification, which I am in favour of in my report. This is not about the procedure, but about the first phase, so to speak. We need to be completely clear about that. In 2002, the Commission issued a communication containing clear deadlines. This was the communication about the relationship with complainants, which already included this information. Why can this not be implemented? I very much regret this. I would like to ask you to reconsider your attitude, because this proposal does not interfere in any way with the Commission’s powers.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have spoken out in praise of the improved cooperation with the Member States. That is right and proper. However, this cannot, of course, replace implementation monitoring, because otherwise we will come down to the level of goodwill and friendship, which is definitely not appropriate for the legal system.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is still an imbalance when it comes to the infringement procedure. There is much less emphasis on protecting the environment than there is on security, for example. Reminders are sent out immediately in the case of security, but the deadlines are extended for breaches of regulations on fine particles.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one thing clear with regard to the reduction in red tape, which everyone always supports. It is important for us to avoid excessive bureaucracy. That is the right thing to do. However, this is generally used by the Member States as an excuse for abolishing environmental legislation. If that is the objective and if the Commission supports this, you will not have my agreement. That would be a violation of the European projects, which are what the citizens of Europe value and appreciate about the European Union. They often believe these projects to be better than what is happening in their own countries. We cannot put this at risk.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I thank the Commission, the Presidency and the Council for attending and participating in this debate, and may I thank colleagues for the very well-informed, detailed and constructive debate that we have had here today. It is quite clear in terms of better, smarter regulation that the core theme needs to be about reducing burdens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recall very clearly President Barroso coming to address a gathering of this House in Brussels in 2004 and pushing for an agenda to reduce burdens through reducing legislation that currently sits on the books. I cannot recall the exact figure, but he said it ran into many thousands of acts that needed to be repealed and put to one side.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I am very encouraged to hear you say that you will reach and exceed the targets by 2012. That is why I argue that we should have a particular Commissioner who is responsible for coming and reporting to this House and saying how far you have proceeded on this agenda. I want to be able to stand here in 2012 and congratulate you, or whichever colleague that takes on this task, and say ‘very well done’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had doubts and I told you today that I had those doubts, but you did it and I congratulate you for it. The ‘one-in, one-out’ principle that I have advocated in my report has been the subject of much debate in committee and here today also but, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, when we get this right, we do not just have one going out, we have 27 going out. However, that raises a further issue in terms of harmony and uniformity of approach. We do not always get that, and that is why I argue that the ‘gold plating’ issue in national parliaments is something which needs to be addressed, whilst underlining the subsidiarity principles and issues that the Presidency has quite rightly picked up on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I finish simply by saying this: there are two colleagues in particular who were present to make their contribution, but they have decided to leave the Chamber now. I find it thoroughly irresponsible when Europe faces the immense challenges that we are facing today that, rather than advocate that we come together for the betterment of all our nations and all our constituents and citizens, their approach is simply to say we should do nothing.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I will even go so far as to cover the Treaty of Lisbon, and indeed its very first article. The article says that the Treaty marks a new stage in the process of forming the Union, ‘in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizens’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The problem in the debate that we had today on access to documents is, in fact, that the presumption that everything is public unless there are reasons for that not to be the case applies neither in the Council nor in the Commission. On the contrary, their guiding principle is to say that ‘everything is shut tight and, you never know, we might just open it up’. The percentage that the President-in-Office of the Council today cited – namely that 75% of Council documents are ultimately made public – is a nice statistic, but that is the wrong approach to take. It would be a completely new style of politics if we were to work on the presumption that transparency is the starting point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If, as we are told, the Commission respects the Treaty of Lisbon and also sees scope for improvement, why do we have to wait 15 months for proposals? You say that the definition of documents is not being adjusted, but I was not of the impression that we would be negotiating at this point. I believe, though, that Parliament does have doubts about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to give two examples of where, at the end of the day, the Council and/or the Commission do not – in my opinion – respect the Treaty of Lisbon. I refer to Article 218 of the implementing agreement, which states that Parliament must have oversight over negotiations with third parties, over international negotiations. Let us take the Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) debate. There is no such oversight in that case. My second example is one that I want to bring to the attention, in particular, of the Polish Presidency. There is in existence a study into the flaws in the European arrest warrant – and Ms Hautala’s working documents make this clear – but the Council refuses to publish the report.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This was a positive exchange of opinions but, above all, I wish Mr Cashman all the best and I would like to offer him our help in improving access to documents in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of transparency contained in it became a legally binding fundamental right of the citizen. Consequently, EU decisions must be adopted as openly as possible and be as comprehensible to EU citizens as possible, particularly as evaluation of all the activities of the EU and confidence in its work is linked to our citizens’ perception and ability to become familiar with European Union activities and documents adopted. Transparency and openness to the world are particularly necessary for strengthening the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental rights. Furthermore, this is the best way to prevent corruption, fraud, conflicts of interest and mismanagement. I would like to stress that any decisions denying citizens access to documents must be based on clearly and strictly defined exceptions founded on sound arguments and reasonably explained, allowing citizens to understand why they are being denied access and to make use of the legal remedies available to them effectively. The European Parliament has already carried out significant work in this field, but all the EU institutions must work together to create more transparent rules on freedom of information which take adequate account of the proposals in this report, recent case-law and the new Treaties. In order to fully ensure an open and regular dialogue with citizens and the organisations representing them and to improve the practices of institutions, thereby moving towards greater transparency, the Council and the Commission should negotiate with Parliament with a view to adopting a new regulation on the right of access to documents.</p>

      <p sl="en">As responsible European decision makers, we cannot ignore the fact that European citizens do not trust European institutions and this also means that they do not necessarily trust us. We have been wondering for years how to remedy this. I think it is a two-way street: openness and efficiency. We have to let citizens get more involved in what we do (via, for example, the European Citizens’ Initiative) but, on the other hand, we also have to inform them about what we do and try to make an effort to do our job better. The better legislation package aims precisely to tackle this second challenge. Transparency and openness should be general principles that go without saying. EU legislation should be straight to the point and understandable for everyone, and this should apply both to the documents produced and the way they are prepared and negotiated. Another important aspect is to carefully analyse the possible outcome of our actions and decisions. This will also ensure that we are not misinterpreting or infringing the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. All this is not only a requirement to restore confidence in European institutions, but it is also a must in a modern-day democracy.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Good legislation provides the foundation for the proper functioning of the single market and the EU as a whole. The proper application of the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and smart regulation is a key factor, especially in view of the current economic situation in Europe. These principles were strengthened and enhanced when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. However, I think that we must continue our efforts towards applying them more fully and adequately, with a view to boosting competitiveness and economic growth within the European Union. I would like to emphasise several points which I consider to be of paramount importance. During the consultation process, a larger number and more suitable tools need to be used to measure the opinion of all stakeholders, just as the mechanisms for gathering feedback should also be enhanced. This would increase the transparency and improve the quality of legislation, which would support its proper application. I regard the introduction of the SME test as a positive step. However, I think that it should be used to a larger extent so that the new legislation’s potential impact can be measured more fully, especially on small and micro-enterprises. I would like to stress again that the introduction of a method for evaluating the influence policies have on competitiveness would support Europe’s efforts to exit the crisis and would help boost economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the vote on the report concerning access to documents. Examples abound for which the work of the institutions should be more transparent in order to prevent corruption, fraud, conflicts of interest and poor administration. In particular, I am thinking of the European Union agencies, since their geographical distance makes it more difficult for Parliament to supervise them. The agencies should give a precise reason when refusing access to documents on the assessment and authorisation of various products and medicines, and should not hide behind commercial reasons. Transparency and access to documents should be a central tool in ensuring that they are properly managed. Similarly, constant recourse to experts and lobbies in other institutions could prevent situations from being assessed objectively. Indeed, transparency, as stipulated under the Treaties, is not limited to legislative procedures, but also covers the non-legislative work of the Union’s institutions and bodies. Thus, the functioning of working groups must be made as transparent as possible, by publishing the names of their members, and the draft agendas and minutes of their meetings.</p>

      <p sl="fi">My thanks go to the rapporteur and the committee for drafting an excellent report. One of the basic requirements of inclusion and for following Union affairs is the ability to access information on the ideas and development costs that underlie decision making.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The universal right of each citizen to have access to documents drawn up by Parliament, the Commission and the Council is enshrined in the EU Treaty. This right is more precisely described in the 2001 Regulation. The report quite rightly states that the EU progressively risks becoming the target of criticism because of the continuous lack of transparency, openness and access to documents and information for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fi">More than one NGO just this past year has taken an EU institution to court for not surrendering documents that were requested, either on time or at all. This is not the way to proceed: there must be adherence to the principle of the greatest possible transparency. Only in exceptional circumstances should the authorities be able to refuse to hand over a document.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This principle of openness must, at long last, be implemented in the EU. A secretive Union beavering away in its ivory tower will not gain favour in the eyes of the people.

Access to public consultations should be improved generally because, if we want to see the widest possible public involvement in the decision-making process, which was one of the main requirements arising from the consultation on priority proposals for the Single Market Act, we should create the right conditions for this, and not just on paper.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Transparency is a general principle, and with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it became a legally binding fundamental right enjoyed by the citizens. In relation to this, all decisions refusing access to documents must be based on very clearly defined exceptions. It is necessary to establish an appropriate balance between transparency and data protection. Data protection should not be ‘misused’, in particular, for the purpose of covering conflicts of interest. Documents relating to international agreements, including documents adopted by any bodies which have the task of implementing or monitoring the application of such agreements, should be disclosed to the public, as they are not categorically excluded from public access. Access to these documents should be refused only when there is real harm to international relations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Willy Meyer, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 2010 (2010/2295(INI)) (A7-0232/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-563-000" speaker_id="28407" name="Willy Meyer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Council representative, Commissioner, I should first of all like to express my gratitude to all the members of the committee, who have allowed us to present this report with an overwhelming consensus; particularly those members who have presented amendments and suggestions in writing to Mr Jahr, Mr Boştinaru, Mr Salavrakos, Ms Werthmann and Mr Boulland, as their contributions have doubtless helped to enhance the presentation of this memorandum to the House.</p>
      <p sl="es">Obviously, I also have to thank the committee secretariat, whose constant efforts and dedication help us to get through vast amounts of work.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this report, which we are discussing today and which will be put to the vote tomorrow, we offer a view of the work carried out in 2010 following a calendar of activities which was not fixed around the legislative programme of the European Commission, but set by the citizens who exercise their right to petition the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report sets out to achieve three goals: firstly, to offer a clear, easily understandable overview of the activities carried out by the Committee on Petitions in 2010; secondly, to highlight the role of the Committee on Petitions and European citizens’ right to petition, a right which enables them to complain about infringements of EU law and which should be a cornerstone of European citizenship; and, lastly, special reference is made to changes in legislation, including the approval of the citizens’ initiative and the legally binding character of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The descriptive part of the report points to a 14% fall in the number of petitions as compared with 2009: a total of 1 655 were presented, while the figure for 2009 was 1 924.</p>
      <p sl="es">The chief subjects of the petitions, in order of importance, were clearly the environment, fundamental rights, the internal market and justice. Given that most petitions are related to the environment, the necessary procedures will need to be adopted to prevent further irreparable damage to the European Union’s biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The languages most commonly used in the petitions presented were German, English, Spanish and Italian. The largest nationality group of the petitioners was German, followed by Spanish, Italian and Romanian. As for the country or countries to which the petitions refer, a significant shift has occurred: petitions relating to Spain are now more numerous than those referring to the European Union as a whole; they are followed by petitions relating to Germany and Italy. The dominant channel for reception is fortunately the Internet – far more commonly used than paper – and the report also highlights the three fact-finding missions conducted by the committee in 2010: the fact-finding mission to the Huelva estuary (Spain) to examine toxic waste management (phosphogypsum and radioactive ash discharges), the mission to Campania (Italy) on urban waste management, and the mission to Voralberg (Austria) relating to the transposition into domestic legislation of the Environmental Impact Directive in connection with a ski-related project.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regarding our committee’s relation with other parliamentary committees, other institutions such as the European Commission, the Council or the Ombudsman, and with the Member States, the report calls for a reduction in the time taken by the European Commission to respond to our requests for investigation, a point that was already included in the previous report presented by Mr Iturgaiz on the annual report for 2009.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Commission must provide regular reports on the current stage of infringement procedures related to petitions. I should like to stress that effective communication with this institution is essential for our committee to be able to carry out its work.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the Member States, the report regrets the negligence that some of them have displayed in the enforcement of and compliance with European environmental legislation. At the same time, we celebrate the excellent rapport which exists between the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and our committee. We also point out that the processing of petitions should be made more transparent.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, I would like to mention that one of the most significant new developments for our committee at the present time is the European Citizens’ Initiative. Our experience tells us that we should stand very close to this new instrument. Similarly, we also believe that it is necessary to launch a debate on the limited applicability of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, given the large number of petitions relating to infringements by the Commission.</p>

    <intervention id="2-564-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Meyer for this very important report and the whole committee for its excellent work. In my response, I would like, if I may, to focus on three particular issues. Firstly, on collaboration with the committee; secondly, on the questions of timing which are raised in the report; and thirdly, on the profile of the petitions on which you most often need our help and assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the first point, I would like to reassure all the honourable Members of the European Parliament of our willing and continued collaboration with your work and provision of all the assistance we can offer. As Mr Meyer’s report points out, you asked us for help with over half of the admissible petitions you received in 2010. That is a pretty impressive number, and I would like to point out that it is almost exactly the same proportion as the year before. I hope that this indicates that we are getting something right and collaborating in a very good spirit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although our help mainly involves initially analysing what EU law, if any, might be applicable in each case, we also attend the – sometimes numerous – follow-up meetings on petitions. I would also like to commend the committee for assisting the Commission, as illustrated by the active participation of Ms Mazzoni and Ms Auken and the committee secretariat, in the recent stakeholder conference on the implementation of environment law organised by the Environment DG. Their participation emphasised to Member States the importance that the committee attaches to the good implementation of environmental law and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is a new – and, we believe, very important – reference in this annual report to timing. Of course, we could point to several cases where we have dealt with a petition after quite a long delay and our action has not been as relevant as it would have been if the timing had been better. But we also have more encouraging examples from recent months – for example, a petition tabled in May which fell within the context of an ongoing debate on origin labelling, with specific reference to canned fish products following the Fukushima disaster. That was well-timed. It is not just in that area that things seem to be going well. I am told that a very promising report by Mr Iturgaiz on the application of waste legislation is due before the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also see from Mr Meyer’s report that you are already planning ahead for the 2013 European Year of Citizenship, which is another encouraging sign. The report indicates that you also hope to be looking at some other citizens’ initiatives by then. As you know, the Citizens’ Initiative regulation will enter into force on 1 April next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, and finally, may I refer to something described as a key issue in the report, in other words, the question of fundamental rights and the applicability of the Charter. The report acknowledges that it is often impossible to invoke the Charter in a petitioner’s case because of the specifics of the case, or because the case just happened to fall outside the scope of EU law. It is disappointing all round if petitioners discover that, to borrow the expression of one of your Members, they have, in effect, been ‘knocking at the wrong door’. For this reason, we very warmly welcome the efforts described in the report to ensure an even better user interface for potential petitioners turning to Parliament, in addition perhaps to some more ‘upstream’ filtering of cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that this topic is even going to draw some amendments tomorrow, and getting it right can only help to underpin the image of the European institutions, which is in the common interest of both the Commission and Parliament. On that note, I would like to close. I am very much looking forward to the discussion.</p>

    <intervention id="2-565-000" speaker_id="96772" name="Peter Jahr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report. With the help of the Committee on Petitions, the citizens of the European Union can draw attention to possible breaches of European Union law or their own national legislation. This enables the Members of this House to find out at first hand what effect the European Union is having on people’s everyday lives. The right of petition is one of the most important and most clearly defined rights of people in Europe. The fact that people are continuing to submit a large number of petitions shows that they know how to use this right.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my speech on the 2009 annual report, I called for us to improve our internal processes. We have succeeded in doing this, in particular with regard to the petitions which do not meet the necessary conditions. I would like to give my sincere thanks to everyone involved, including the Members of this House and the petition administrators. We will continue working to ensure that everyone receives an appropriate response as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">One central theme of many petitions is environmental law. I think that there are two areas for improvement in this respect. Firstly, we need better communication between the Commission and the Member States. The information is often incomplete and not up-to-date. This problem is generally caused by a cautious information policy in the Member States. The Commission is genuinely making an effort in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, in particular with regard to complaints concerning long-lasting environmental projects, we need instruments which will allow us to intervene during the planning phase and not to wait until the end of the project or, even worse, until the building stage is completed. If we then establish that the project was in breach of current legislation, but the building is already in place, it is very, very difficult to rectify the situation in these individual cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to remind everyone about the citizens’ initiative which was adopted this year. This instrument will allow the citizens of Europe to play an active part in political events in future. For me, it is essential that the Committee on Petitions is given an appropriate role because it is the only genuine citizens’ committee.</p>

    <intervention id="2-566-000" speaker_id="39711" name="Victor Boştinaru" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I must begin by emphasising once again the importance of, and the special role played by, the Committee on Petitions in guaranteeing and defending the rights of European citizens when they are infringed by a Member State or European authority. Indeed, as MEPs elected by the citizens of our Union, it is not only our right but also our duty to defend them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to highlight two important points from the debate on the Meyer report. First of all, I regret that, in spite of a large number of petitions concerning serious violations of the human rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Commission either refuses or explains that it cannot take any action, allegedly due to the lack of instruments. I will now quote from the Venice Commission’s report on the Hungarian Constitution: once ratified, the Charter of Fundamental Rights ‘is a legal, binding piece of legislation’, which is still not obvious to the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, with regard to European environmental legislation, the European Commission should exercise tighter control and consequently take action in order to guarantee compliance with and the enforcement of all European acts and laws. This step must be carried out at every stage in a project’s progression and not only after it has been implemented. On this point, I would like to draw the European Commission’s attention to the huge project under way in Roşia Montană in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I take this opportunity to thank Mr Meyer once again for his excellent cooperation, as well as all the members of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-567-000" speaker_id="28161" name="Margrete Auken" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, my thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič and Mr Meyer for their work. I do not want to repeat what my fellow Members have said. I agree with most of it, although I would just like to say to the Commissioner that it is, in fact, a problem that he does not believe that human rights are important in this context. In committee, we heard from the Commission that, for example, the Copenhagen Criteria can only be mobilised when a country is in the process of accession. Clearly, it is not good for our credibility if all of these fundamental values can be disregarded. However, we will be carrying out a consultation with regard to this in the near future, so let us leave it at that.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to use my speaking time here first and foremost to describe what are, in fact, the rather poor conditions that I think Parliament sets for our committee. Our committee is the one that is close to citizens. We are very proud of this when we talk about citizens’ rights to the outside world, but when it comes down to it, we actually work under very poor conditions.</p>
      <p sl="da">The website is designed for advanced users. People cannot find our committee. I have now heard that it is possible to lodge a complaint electronically, and I am pleased about that. I was not aware that this was possible up to now, but it is good to hear. It is something new. Thank you for that.</p>
      <p sl="da">We also need better resources so that, in the meantime, we can carry out our own investigations, including in relation to the legal investigations. The arrangement with the Commission usually works well, but it would be nice if we could deal better with the many complaints that we receive. We must not forget that citizens have rights laid down in the Treaty to come to us with their complaints.</p>
      <p sl="da">Lastly, there are also two areas where I do not think that we are being treated well enough. The committee’s neutralisation, in other words, the fact that it is a second class committee, means that the members are very often unable to be present and carry out the work of the committee. This is a very bad signal to send to citizens, as it will give them the impression that they are not being respected.</p>
      <p sl="da">Last of all, I would like to say that the name of the Committee is totally incomprehensible, at least in Danish, Finnish and Swedish: ‘Udvalget for Andragender’ (the Committee on Petitions). It is an obsolete bureaucratic word that not a single soul can fathom at all. As names go, it ought to be a simple matter to give the committee a name that citizens can recognise, such as the ‘Committee on Citizen Complaints’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have only one problem with this otherwise excellent report, which is that it omits any mention of the problem which has generated the highest number of petitions in recent years. This, of course, is the Spanish property issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hundreds of EU citizens from many countries have spent their life savings on dream properties in Spain, only to wake up one morning to find an eviction notice on the mat and a bulldozer at the gate.</p>
      <p sl="en">For a decade, Spain has refused to deal with this issue. It denies property rights and enforceable contracts to EU citizens; it defies the rule of law; it makes a nonsense of our commitment to human rights. This is a scandal. It shows the impotence not only of the Committee on Petitions, but of this Parliament and indeed of the EU generally to deliver on the promises we make to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Boştinaru has complained that the Commission is not active enough in dealing with these breaches of human rights and in this case, that applies too. I call on the Commission to get a grip on this action and to insist that the problem is solved, and solved rapidly.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-569-000" speaker_id="28404" name="Matteo Salvini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the report that we shall be voting on tomorrow, but I am struck by how far removed debate within the European institutions is from the daily life of nearly 500 million European citizens. Yes, there are 500 million European citizens and last year there were 1 600 petitions, of which more than 1 000 were filed. This demonstrates just how well-known, how useful and how effective these petitions are, without even bothering to count the hundreds of petitions from recent years that still await attention. I saw that the Committee on Petitions visited Naples last year, but to resolve the situation there, they need a miracle rather than a committee.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the plus side, we are here talking about the right of initiative of a million European citizens who are entitled to start a petition. Great, but it is a shame that even if 400 million Europeans all signed on what Parliament has already debated and voted on – such as the incredible matter of Parliament’s dual seat in Brussels and Strasbourg – there is no petition and no popular will that could put a stop to all this. Indeed, meeting here in Strasbourg once a month results in EUR 400 million of excess spending and demonstrates just how detached from reality the European institutions are at a time of economic crisis, cuts and savings in Italy, Spain and Greece. I therefore wish the committee all the best, while recognising the fact that this is probably not the way that the institutions will manage to provide a response to citizens.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-570-000" speaker_id="97016" name="Angelika Werthmann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, this annual report is primarily intended to describe the progress that has been made. This year’s report is essentially the same as last year’s and also as the report from 2008. Of course, this has nothing to do with Mr Meyer. I have a very high opinion of him and I would like to thank him for this report. It is simply that the facts do not allow any other picture to be presented. The subjects are the same and the Member States involved are the same. For years, a large proportion of the petitions submitted to the European Parliament have concerned shortcomings in the implementation of environmental directives. Perhaps it is time to review the type of legislation in this area and to investigate a variety of options, in order to finally begin reducing the number of breaches of EU law. Do we need additional guidelines from the Commission on implementing the legislation or do we need closer monitoring?</p>
      <p sl="de">In our work in the committee, we rely on active cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the form of statements, but the Council is often conspicuous by its absence from these committee meetings. We definitely need to revise the way we work. If the debates in the committee are not followed by action, then our work will be delayed or even undermined. It may be that the reduction in the number of newly submitted petitions is the right thing to happen. However, this reduction could also mean that the citizens no longer regard the right of petition at a European Union level as a useful option.</p>
      <p sl="de">I support the calls made in this report without reservations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-571-000" speaker_id="96817" name="Erminia Mazzoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič, and also Mr Meyer for the work he has carried out. As in each year, this report summarises the work performed over the previous year and must therefore be seen as acknowledgement and acceptance of it. I will bring together all the criticisms – which I will take as recommendations – put forward by my fellow Members, beginning with Ms Werthmann’s, which relates to a certain repetitiveness in the issues dealt with and a lack of efficiency in the work of the Committee on Petitions. On the issue of the environment, which is a recurring theme in our committee as the subject of many complaints made by citizens, we are currently debating a report that we should like to bring to Parliament asking for the Commission to intervene, bearing in mind the complaints submitted by the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, there have also been some significant events this year. The most important of those listed by my fellow Members was the adoption of the regulation on the citizens’ initiative. This gives legislative power to citizens and is therefore not – as Mr Salvini said – designed to submit petitions on behalf of a greater number of citizens; it hands over legislative power and this is an important fact.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the citizens’ initiative, the Committee on Petitions claimed a role in the regulatory procedure set up to provide for public hearings, as agreed with Mr Šefčovič and others. I hope that there is some action taken on this request put forward by the committee.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is also essential to pay a different level of attention to the problems related to the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This, too, is mentioned in the report and will be the subject of a seminar to be held on 6 October by the Committee on Petitions and the Commission, together with academics and researchers, to provide some answers which can form guidelines for us.</p>
      <p sl="it">Referring one last time to the speech by Mr Salvini, I do not think that the Committee on Petitions can solve citizens’ problems, but it can serve to promote the democracy required to stimulate and build a political Europe.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-572-000" speaker_id="4532" name="Michael Cashman" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this report on the activities of the Petitions Committee in 2010 and I want to pay particular tribute to the work of the secretariat, under David Lowe, which deals with thousands of petitions. That is proof enough of the success of this system. I also want to underline the Committee’s important collaboration with the European Ombudsman and growing collaboration with the Commission, and especially Commissioner Reding, who has always been present at the committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would stress, also, the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is now enforceable, and we need to bring it more and more into our work. However, I deplore the limits of the enforceability of the CFR, for example, in the domain of property rights and the long-standing issue of the Spanish ‘land grab’ of legally built and legally purchased houses. It is a scandal that has been going on since 2004, sadly. Mr Helmer highlighted this, but it is no use attacking the Commission and the EU when the only solution to this issue rests with the Spanish Government. It should address it immediately.</p>
      <p sl="en">Property rights are a growing concern; we have seen even more petitions on this issue, which is now spreading to other parts of the EU, including Bulgaria and Cyprus. Finally, therefore, let me make a recommendation. It is time, I believe, for a high-level commission or seminar on the issue of property rights and purchases of property in other countries to be undertaken immediately on behalf of the EU if we are to inform and protect our citizens in the future.</p>

    <intervention id="2-573-000" speaker_id="105624" name="Philippe Boulland" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meyer, and my colleagues, who have been critical in their comments at times, but this 2010 own-initiative report is ultimately a tremendous opportunity to talk about the Committee on Petitions, because people still do not know enough about it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, this committee has a direct, and sometimes physical, link with the citizens, who can themselves contribute to our debates. Its legitimacy within Parliament is undisputed, and it has long-established expertise thanks to its direct link with the public. Indeed, any petitioner can come to Parliament and defend his or her rights before the Committee on Petitions. We can also applaud the calmness of its debates, despite the often distressing cases that they deal with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This committee represents what Europe should be: willing to listen to its citizens’ problems and united in finding solutions to protect them. Unfortunately, its scope for taking action and exerting pressure remains limited, particularly when it comes to the environmental risk of projects that are sometimes near completion. I also see this when a specific case, such as family rights or the rights of the child in a divorce, is being defended. We are, incidentally, going to carry out an exercise on this subject in November.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another regret I have is that the national authorities are still slow in providing us with all the information that we need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to thank the European Commission for the research and verification work it is doing, even though it could occasionally go further in searching for the truth. I must also pay tribute to the constructive work that we are doing with the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I appeal to the citizens: carry on submitting your petitions to us, your directly elected representatives. Our role will always be to protect your interests strictly in accordance with European law.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, I am delighted that you are present at this debate, as you are well known for your favourable attitude to civic initiatives. Although many people have given up on public involvement, there are still many sending in petitions to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Many petitions involve appeals against decisions taken by national authorities. In any case, most petitions are about the incorrect application of European legislation, whether as a result of incorrect transposition, deficiencies in application or infringements. In order not to waste the precious interest and activity of the European citizens who turn to us, we must work in particular on awareness of powers. In the petitions assessed as unacceptable, many involved cases where the petitioners confused national powers with European powers, and the institutions of the EU with the Council of Europe, and especially with the Court of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Although our rejection of such petitions is lawful, we should ensure that the public is sufficiently well informed as to the division of powers, as to the meaning of the right to petition, and as to what can be achieved by submitting a petition to Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Meyer for all his efforts on this report, which features the main recommendations regarding the Committee on Petitions’ future operation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must point out the basic problem impairing its effectiveness, which is the lack of information provided to the general public. In 2010, there was a drop in the number of petitions submitted to Parliament, with many of them being declared inadmissible. The transparency required by Parliament is largely guaranteed by the Committee on Petitions. This is why measures must be adopted, aimed at promoting citizens’ initiatives. This would help provide the support required for future legislative initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must stress the role played by the Commission in implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU. This supplement to Community acquis has a direct impact on citizens. Monitoring its enforcement ensures an improvement in living conditions across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a member who has just had to withdraw from the Committee on Petitions, I would like to thank my colleagues on that committee, and indeed the secretariat and all who have helped me. It is simply a question of workload on other committees.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do think it is important that we draw attention to our successes. In my time, we had Equitable Life where soon, the UK Government will be paying out compensation to EU citizens who had problems. We also have the unresolved problem of property rights that other colleagues have mentioned here. I would support the call by Michael Cashman that some initiative should be taken for citizens who purchase properties in other Member States, either to warn them that they are not protected as EU citizens or to do something about it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to say thank you very much for all the contributions by the honourable Members and the excellent work done by the Committee on Petitions. Allow me to respond to some of the comments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we all know that one of the Commission’s very important roles is to be the guardian of the treaties, so we have to respect the law. We have to respect the division of labour between European and national levels and our stance must be always legally precise and correct. Otherwise, every step we take, every act we adopt, could be challenged in the European Court of Justice. Therefore, sometimes an approach that you may find cautious is very important from the point of view of how correctly we apply the law because we are responsible for monitoring that European law is always correctly applied. We must therefore lead by example.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand your preoccupations and that a lot of the petitioners who are unhappy with the results of their efforts then complain that they were not properly informed in advance. I therefore think Mr Jahr’s idea to improve communication on pieces of legislation that are particularly complicated – which is usually the case in the field of the environment – is very important. We particularly appreciate the fact that both Ms Mazzoni and Ms Auken participated in the seminar organised by DG Environment because this is exactly how we would like to promote awareness on these very complicated pieces of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another item which was highlighted several times by Members is the element of fundamental rights. Here again, we have to respect the law, and the fact that the fundamental rights in the Charter cannot be invoked outside the scope of the EU is, we know, a frequent source of disappointment for petitioners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, again with your help and cooperation, we are going to organise a special conference on the workability of the Charter early next month, on 6 October. I am sure that this will also help to raise awareness of what is applicable and what is not and how the EU Charter can be applied and monitored by the EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Citizens’ Initiative. We have been working very closely with the Committee on Petitions and Ms Mazzoni, and we have been going through the regulations. There is interest in the European Parliament, and the number of rapporteurs proves how important the ECI is for the European Parliament also. I was therefore glad that in the end, we could find a compromise where we agreed that the hearings would be organised at the European Parliament because we in the Commission also found it very important for parliamentary ground to be used for the deliberations at these hearings.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sure that the Committee on Petitions will be properly involved, but of course it would be an internal European Parliament decision to decide how the European Citizens’ Initiative will be treated by the European Parliament and the respective committees.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe the debate has brought up the concerns shared by the members of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, we should like to repeat for the second time that we need to be more stringent about speeding up the time taken to process petitions which may involve damage to the European Union’s biodiversity. Quite often, so much time is spent between the opening of the proceedings, transfer to the Commission, the Commission issuing a request for information to the Member State, the Member State responding, and so on, that in the case of public – or private – works that are potentially hazardous to biodiversity, by the time a letter of notice is sent or a court takes action, the damage is already done and irreparable.</p>
      <p sl="es">For the second time, we are making this urgent call for greater stringency on the Member States and for much greater celerity in the actions of Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, this committee believes it is in the best position to take on the task of monitoring the citizens’ initiative. This is indeed an important instrument, as it effectively allows the members of the European public to submit legislation petitions to this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also wish to voice a concern that has emerged in relation to the subject of property, and which has not been specified in the report because we have chosen not to give an exhaustive account of all activities, except for the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: we believe that the lack of legal instruments must be resolved, and to achieve this we believe we need to hold a debate, which is already open before us, to ensure that the necessary legal instruments are provided and applied in all the Member States across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall finish as I began, by thanking all my colleagues for their help and acknowledging once again all the secretariat’s hard work. I therefore hope that we will be able to conclude this report for 2010 in tomorrow’s vote, and that we will not need to repeat once again in 2011 the need to expedite the processing of certain petitions involving a potential risk to biodiversity in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Committee on Petitions’ repeated calls to be kept informed of the progress of infringement proceedings relating to open petitions remain unanswered in most cases. Petitioners contact their local MEPs in order to follow their petition and it is embarrassing and simply not acceptable that we cannot inform them of the status of their petitions. Therefore, paragraph 24 is particularly welcome and pertinent. The Commission also needs to be forthcoming regarding the progress of their investigations, upon initial examination of a petition (which usually takes six to eight months); neither the MEP nor the petitioners receive any feedback on what are usually very urgent matters. A sense of urgency needs to be adopted by the Commission. I would like to draw attention to Recital L: 40% of petitions received are inadmissible; we need to work to raise citizens’ awareness of petitions. Confusion remains on the different EU and national competences, as well as those of the EU institutions, in particular, the European Court of Human Rights. Petitioners are often unsure of what exactly constitutes an admissible petition. As petitions are the earliest indications that Member States are lagging behind in implementing EU law, the Commission must recognise the role and crucial importance of petitions in monitoring the effective implementation of EU law.</p>

Each Member will have a minute to put his or her question, then the Commission will respond and the Member will have 30 seconds to put a supplementary question. The important thing for the Commissioners to note is that they will be limited in their replies to two minutes; that is two minutes for a reply from one Commissioner. If more than one Commissioner wishes to respond to the same question, I will give them a minute apiece.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a little less than a year ago, Parliament adopted the new directive to combat late payments. This was a vital recast which, by imposing firm deadlines on payments made by public administrations, satisfies the requests made by businesses and citizens and amounts to a formidable counter-cyclical measure that will also combat unemployment, which is laying waste to our countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would point out in this regard that one in four businesses fail due to late payments by public administrations, with the resulting loss of many jobs. Member States must transpose this new legislation not later than 16 March 2013. I would therefore like to ask Mr Tajani what measures the Commission is taking to ensure proper transposition of the directive into the various national legal systems and to facilitate the early entry into force of the directive, as promised by a number of Member States?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, the European Commission is working actively to ensure that all Member States transpose the directive adopted by Parliament and the Council as quickly as possible; the sooner it is transposed, the more money there will be in circulation. We expect that around EUR 180 billion will come into circulation after the entry into force of this directive in all 27 Member States of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">As per my instructions, at tomorrow’s meeting Mr Calleja – the Deputy Director General or ‘Mr SME’ as he is known – will ask the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) ambassadors, who were appointed by all Member States at the request of the European Commission, to exert pressure on their parliaments to transpose the directive as quickly as possible and, hence, before the deadline.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must mention that some regions and some local authorities, such as the Lombardy Region in Italy, have acted early and of their own volition to implement the directive on late payments in order to put money into circulation. This, in turn, means that SMEs need not be suffocated by the payment delays which, in some Member States, are of genuinely biblical proportions. I am committed to continuing to insist at every opportunity – in every meeting I hold with the various Member States on SMEs – on the transposition of the Late Payments Directive. I hope the national parliaments and Member States will act swiftly in receiving this message from the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioners, would you not agree that the time has come for the Commission to take a strong, clear stance before the European public, to say that the flexibility that employers need, and also the security that workers and employers alike are claiming, will depend on what happens in the future, that there needs to be a balance between these two variables, and that conditions in the future should not be worse than those of the past?</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission is studying very thoroughly the consequences of the recent financial and economic crisis for the labour market and how the European labour market transformed compared with the previous decade.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is absolutely true that even before the crisis, not simply as a consequence of it, the rise of precarious forms of employment were a major concern. Some countries, especially Mr Cercas’s home country of Spain, developed in a very unfortunate way, producing a large number of unprotected jobs especially in certain industries like construction. This is especially the case for young people and workers with a migrant background. These groups, especially where they overlap, find themselves in a very difficult situation. We are paying attention to this, and this is also why in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, we are putting forward a number of initiatives to address the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">One such initiative, on which we had a tremendous debate in this House also, was the question of the single open-ended contract. This is because we want to bridge the gap; we want to abolish the segmentation of the labour market. We are not offering this as a kind of uniform solution because the reality of the labour market in various countries is quite diverse. There are actually some economies that are performing well, where the protection remained quite solid, and this type of segmentation, which is mainly a characteristic of the Mediterranean countries, was not apparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some of the forthcoming conferences, including the 16 November conference on flexi-security, we intend to continue a thorough analysis of these developments and we will come back to this next year in various initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="es">We would not wish that, in order to prevent a dualisation of the job market, the same poor conditions that have hitherto been experienced by some people were henceforth to be experienced by one and all. Dualisation must be avoided, but not by lowering everybody’s protection to the level of those who are currently most unprotected. We need to give opportunities to young people with contracts that will allow them to improve their capabilities and to become more integrated in the companies they work for, and not destroy the security that exists in today’s industrial relations.</p>

      <p sl="en">The intention is very clear. It is not about lowering the level of protection but ensuring that young people, after they enter the labour market, will build up a certain level of protection faster than in the previous period. There are many reasons why we would like to achieve this, such as competitiveness, because they need to integrate into the labour market and develop skills. But there are also, for example, demographic consequences that result from the young generation experiencing such a huge amount of uncertainty in their lives.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU, and I address this mainly to Commissioner Reding, has legislated in many areas of conditions at work, including equal rights and non-discrimination, so that female, gay, disabled or ethnic minority workers are treated fairly. But, if they move across borders under the Free Movement Directive or Posted Workers Directive, they do not have the assurance of a level playing field of equal treatment outside work; for instance, in housing, education, supply of services and so on, due to the failure of the Council to agree over the last three or four years a new anti-discrimination directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alongside and very much related to that, there is no guarantee of recognition of same sex marriages and civil partnerships, including in tax, property and parental rights, supposedly because Member States have prerogatives in family law.</p>

Parliament has been constantly asking Council to stop blocking it. I can tell you that the Polish Presidency is continuing the discussion on this directive and is focusing on the issue of age, for instance, or favourable conditions for older people, the treatment of minors and age in financial services. They have concentrated on this in order to at least find a way out where Member States could discuss these issues.

      <p sl="el">How, and subject to what preconditions, do you believe that new flexible forms of employment can be combined with the fight against poverty, so as to safeguard in practice both increased competitiveness and a socially positive result overall?</p>

      <p sl="en">The issue of the working poor is indeed a major and increasing problem. In the aftermath of the economic crisis – the great recession – we observe with great concern the increasing number of working poor. It is obvious that structural unemployment has been a key factor in increasing poverty. That is why we concentrated on fighting structural unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there is an overlap here and the content of our agenda is key to this issue: investment in skills and focusing on how this could be reinforced by vocational training through lifelong learning in order to maintain the competitiveness of the labour force. In fact, the Dublin Foundation, Eurofound, recently proved in a quantitative study that there is a so-called hollowing-out phenomenon in the labour market, which means that the second and the third quintiles have shrunk in terms of earnings, while the number of jobs in the lowest and the highest two have increased. It is the second and third which are in the greatest difficulties. We therefore observe a major problem in terms of the integrity of the labour market. This is also connected with the problem of segmentation, which we tried to address in the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer is clearly partly legislative: to ensure that contracts offering earlier protection become more widespread; that young people get into permanent jobs more quickly after leaving school; and that in all Member States, there are more opportunities to invest in skills at all levels and thereby help employees preserve their competitiveness in the intensely competitive environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">We will study the connection between the spread of atypical forms of work and health and safety statistics. In fact, in recent years, there have been improvements on various fronts thanks to the Commission’s policy on health and safety. It is also true that, because of the crisis – also in reference to Mr Cercas’s point – a huge number of atypical forms, especially fixed jobs, were simply abolished or disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is probably true that because there is less integration into a particular job and a particular culture, there is probably less training and introduction into safety and health, and employees develop the understanding of their own particular working environment more slowly and on a lower level.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we will have to study this, especially in this period, because next year we are planning to develop a new long-term safety and health strategy, which has to be evidence-based.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. A few weeks ago, Mr Andor, I visited a large building site in France along with other Members from my group to find out at first hand about how mobile European workers are being treated. Those employees in particular who were supplied by temporary employment agencies and who came from Poland, for example, were being subjected to appalling exploitation. Their working conditions were very poor. During this year alone, up to the time of our visit, three people had died in occupational accidents on the building site. The workers lived in dreadful conditions. Tax and social security contributions were deducted from their wages, but they had no right to health insurance. It was not clear where the taxes were actually going. This is just one of many examples of how the legal and also the illegal opportunities are being exploited.</p>
      <p sl="de">My questions are: What measures is the Commission planning to take to guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented properly in the Member States? What proposals is the Commission making to prevent employees recruited through long chains of subcontractors from being exploited?</p>

      <p sl="en">Ms Steinruck, first of all, let me thank you for your earlier intervention, in the summer, on this topic, as a result of which I raised this issue at my recent meeting with Minister Bertrand in France and received information that the French authorities were also looking at this case very seriously. This is exactly the type of situation which justifies the Commission’s efforts to deliver a new enforcement directive on the posting of workers. I believe it is necessary, because in previous years, there have been a huge number of cases – some of them very well-known following court rulings, but there are many that are less well-known – where workers, but also entrepreneurs, found themselves in very difficult situations because of the lack of clarity, and the lack of clear interpretation and implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are delivering an enforcement directive later this year. It is a strategic initiative in the Commission’s work programme for this year, and this will also be accompanied by a so-called ‘Monti II’ regulation. I think this will form a good and balanced package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been discussing this also with the Polish Presidency which has a strong interest in this, also because in some cases, like the one you referred to, there are Polish workers involved, though it is true that Germany is also a country which receives and sends a huge number of posted workers, so I also count on German stakeholders to participate in this debate.</p>

One is the Working Time Directive, to find out where we are at the moment on this, and whether you believe that there will be any movement in terms of retaining the voluntary opt out so that we have that flexibility, and whether you believe that the Council is moving on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Incidentally, thank you very much for visiting Bridgnorth Aluminium in my constituency to hear for yourself from employers and employees alike of the need for flexibility regarding the Working Time Directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I assume that you are not saying that we should have an additional directive on top of the current Posting of Workers Directive, but should make sure that we implement the current directive correctly – which obviously is not being done at the moment, as was referred to by my colleague.</p>

      <p sl="en">There are three questions in one, the first being about the Working Time Directive. As you know, we had two consultations between the social partners. The second one ended in March; it was actually extended after a request from the social partners. We also had further reasons to wait for a while for confirmation by the social partners at European level on whether they wanted to negotiate on a new directive or not.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been in close dialogue with both sides and I am still waiting for a final answer which I hope will arrive soon. If it is positive on both sides, it will be the prerogative of the social partners, BUSINESSEUROPE and the ETUC, to negotiate. They would have nine months for that and I believe this would be a very good way because they are the key stakeholders. It is in their interests, as it is in the interests of many firms and workers in Europe, to obtain a functioning Working Time Directive as a result. Further than that, I would not like to comment on any aspect of the Working Time Directive because at this phase, it is for the social partners to decide what they would like to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad you appreciate my visit to Bridgnorth. Indeed, it was a great experience to study how various directives, including safety and health, work in British industry, in the remaining British industry. We do pay attention to the discussions on employment legislation in Britain in this very lively conference period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Enforcement Directive, the intention was clearly not to open up the original Posting of Workers Directive because I believe personally – and I think I enjoy the support of the Commission – that the original intention of this, to facilitate cross-border services and to avoid social dumping, is still valid. We have to do both and I believe this Enforcement Directive, for example, will facilitate better cooperation between authorities in various Member States and also clarify the roles of who is supposed to do what in certain conditions. Thus, we would have better functioning with much less in the way of misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>

      <p sl="es">We all realise how important professional mobility is in building a versatile, competitive workforce. In fact, two of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy are innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Vice-President, as you know, we currently have Erasmus for undergraduates, the Marie Curie programme for researchers and Erasmus for entrepreneurs.

I know full well that new forms of work means flexible forms of work, means seasonal forms of work, means contracts of limited term, means underemployment, means telecommuting. All this translates into uncertainty about the future, into restrictions on social rights, into restrictions on pension rights and into a huge opportunity for unwarranted redundancies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Have you heard the word ‘jobber’? It refers to young people who are unable to accept that their future is a future of uncertain working conditions and opt to make underemployment a way of life.

      <p sl="en">This is a very timely question. In fact, on Thursday, I will host a conference in Brussels about wages and wage-setting, which will also discuss collective agreements and the role of the social dialogue in wage-setting in Europe. I think this is a very important topic right now because of the developments not only in the labour market, but also in terms of economic governance in the European Union, and the two are obviously interlinked. But I would like to express a doubt about simply looking at the new developments in a negative light. In fact, many of these are also bringing new opportunities or just represent a necessary response to the challenges of the global economy. I think it has been proven in recent years that, for example, without flexibility, there is just no competitive economy, which we also want to maintain and even further develop, but we have to find the right forms of flexibility. Very often, as we learned in time of crisis, internal flexibility was the answer. The social partners also cooperated in terms of finding the best form of flexibility within a particular firm or within a particular industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have to maintain social rights as much as possible. We have to maintain the European social model and I think we have to look together for the necessary ways of adjusting this European social model, which will certainly have to be maintained.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I think that the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs is, in itself, a form of traineeship for young people starting work. I think that it is a very important link between school – university – and businesses, and fulfils the aim of providing training for young people who are in a position to start work after university, or after school.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is with this aim in mind that I will be organising a summit in Rome before the end of the year with businesses, the Commission and Commissioner Vassiliou, on the subject of education and training for young people.</p>

For example, the move towards sustainability requires a kind of greening of this policy as well. We also may need to think about facilitating change, either by facilitating transition in the agricultural sector – whether towards tourism or towards other types of activities – or just by facilitating modernisation through the purchase of new equipment.</p>

This arises partly because before the summer break, the final report on the work of the high-level group on key enabling technologies (KETs), which will become the secondary raw material of innovation, was presented in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. When we think about work, we cannot fail to think about innovative work for young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, I see that the honourable Members from the Mediterranean have received the message from Ms Wallis and are giving Mr Andor a short break. Thank you very much for your question, Ms Sartori.</p>
      <p sl="it">The high-level group, chaired by me and Jean Therme, achieved some very positive results and has shown that the growth potential – and therefore the job-creation potential – in this sector is striking. Growth of between 5% and 16% is expected, depending on the technology in question, between now and 2015, with revenues likely to jump from USD 832 billion today to around USD 1 300 billion within the next five years. I wonder which other sectors can generate similar development and growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a strategically important sector that affects many products, from computers to all high-tech sectors and onward to renewables. It is hence an important contributor to our work against climate change and in support of the green economy, which Mr Andor spoke about and to which the Commission is hugely committed, partly because it generates jobs and promotes well-being. At this moment in time, I think it is very important for us all to strive for growth, while also focusing on these highly innovative sectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must, however, move past the phase of researching the funding for big projects that show the benefits of this work and start moving forward, as highlighted in the final document on key enabling technologies (KETs) mentioned by Ms Sartori. Of course it is important to work on research in these sectors, but it is even more important to work on applied research in these sectors because Europe – unlike our global competitors – concentrates a great deal on research and not enough on applied research.

You will surely agree with me that good legislation and employment codes should be an instrument for encouraging employers to create and fill new posts. The employment code in Slovakia, which was approved by the right-wing government, is perhaps unique in Europe. The average working time of an employee, including overtime, may exceed 48 hours and employees may perform 400 hours overtime in a calendar year, or as much as 50 hours in the case of managerial employees. My question is therefore: why did Slovakia secure an exemption from Union law, when the country has a long term unemployment level of 13%?</p>

      <p sl="en">From my perspective, obviously this is not a good way to proceed and far from an optimal situation, but that is why we have launched the procedure through consultation for a new Working Time Directive which would be widely applicable in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We follow the evolution of labour legislation in various Member States. Sometimes, there is concern because it is true that sometimes a sufficient balance between flexibility and security is not provided. There are also cases where the social partners are not sufficiently consulted. I believe it is very important to consult the social partners and potentially other stakeholders before delivering labour legislation, and it is very important to revise it if there has perhaps been a long time – decades – since the last act and the economy has changed massively in the period in-between.</p>
      <p sl="en">Slovakia, mentioned in the question, is one of the countries where we have been looking at cases to see whether there is evidence of non-compliance with EU law, which we will obviously take very seriously.</p>

      <p sl="en">This question is to Commissioner Andor, and is not so much on new forms of work as on the whole issue of job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many people believe that technology is displacing jobs. Take, for example, the new super iPhone that will be released at the end of the month, which will displace cameras, portable televisions, laptops, video recorders and landlines. The fact is that these new iPhones will be manufactured using technology with minimum labour input, and most of them will be sold on the Internet. More and more students, for example, are using the new iPad with consequent impacts on printers and publishers, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">The comment I am making is that, while we are always being told we are moving up the value chain at European level, is technology not displacing more and more jobs? I would like your view on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second question follows on from what Mr Niculescu said. There are sectors where technology cannot displace humans or people, and one of those is the care sector. Given that people are living longer, there will be more and more demand for care services.

There are sectors identified where we can anticipate an increase in the number of jobs. During our dialogues, BUSINESSEUROPE suggested that more jobs will be created in industry. However, job creation is expected to be more dynamic in services, particularly in a number of sectors such as education – broadly speaking – and health and care.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was one of the conclusions of our Spring conference with the Nobel Prize winner, Professor Pissarides – one of the great experts on this issue. Together, we looked at the transformation of the European labour market.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am just wondering whether we should not look at the way we organise ourselves, and at creating more jobs from less work, and perhaps at finding other ways of distributing wealth, because that is a crucial issue as far as jobs are concerned. I do not think we have had a real debate and discussion that has changed the work and the job landscape for ever. I do hear what you are saying, but I would like to see more action at European level to indicate that we are recognising the new world we live in and that the Commission is responding to it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mrs Harkin, if you would allow me, I would express some disagreement with this latest point. In the first decade of this century, technology was developing but we managed to increase the number of jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The employment rate increased until the crisis. It was the crisis that destroyed a huge number of jobs, and not technology. Technology, of course, continues to develop and new technologies will be introduced in the future. In many cases it will provide new opportunities because it will change the nature and profile of many jobs, but I really doubt that this is a big threat to our employment level. I believe we have to look at all possible consequences, and we should not portray technology as a big danger to our employment patterns.</p>

      <p sl="el">Commissioners, fine words indeed at a time when, in Greece, the representatives in the Troika, including the Commission representative, are exerting pressure and demanding the abolition of collective agreements, in order to bring about greater flexibility on the market. This will be a disaster, due in part to the structure of the Greek economy. The European trade unions are accusing you of interfering to the detriment of the workers. When I asked Mr Andor, he replied that collective agreements are a matter of national law.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question, therefore, is this: does the Commissioner stand by his statement that collective agreements are a matter of national law? Secondly, if so, in what capacity is the Commission representative in the Troika pushing for the abolition of collective agreements? As a representative of the Commission or as a representative of Greece’s creditors?</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to insist that Greece is a special case, especially now in this period. We should not look at the Greek case as something that would be a template for others. We are much luckier than that and the Greek situation requires very specific treatment. I was in Greece twice earlier this year and also spoke with the trade unions – there was a European trade union conference in Athens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I spoke last week with the head of the new task force which was established in July, and urged Mr Reichenbach to speak to the social partners as early as possible. I also believe it is right to maintain the role of the social partners. However, the role of the social dialogue and collective bargaining in an emergency situation cannot be the same as in normal situations. The emergency is an emergency and there are specificities in that. I think it is very important that Greece receives sufficient support from other European countries and other sources, like the IMF for example, but it is also important that Greece delivers in terms of reforms and transformation because otherwise, we will never arrive at a sustainable situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is in the interests of all parties involved to work for a more sustainable, stronger structure with Greece involved.</p>

Now we have Portugal, Ireland and, possibly, Spain, Italy and France. Therefore, we are not responding to the problem of the abolition of labour rights, by saying that they are a special case. In the final analysis, Commissioners, what are you, as the Commission, doing in connection with workers’ fundamental rights, precisely because this is a special situation?</p>

      <p sl="en">We are working on the further development of the social dialogue in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also been to Ireland and Portugal, the difficult cases mentioned by the honourable Member, and the discussion was very far from undermining or abolishing the social dialogue. In certain countries, there is probably a need to reform the social dialogue in its existing forms, but you are unlikely to have ever seen the Commission supporting, advocating or demanding any diminishing of the social dialogue. On the contrary. In the Europe 2020 flagship initiative ‘Agenda for new skills and jobs’, we introduced a new element in the social dialogue at EU level, the Tripartite Social Forum, in addition to the existing Tripartite Social Summit. It has a wider format which involves more sectoral representatives, and contributes to the dialogue at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The social dialogue will probably not be the same after the crisis as before, but I am sure it will be stronger at European level and I believe there will be many other cases where new elements will emerge.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well, Mr Kelly, I have already spoken about the TalkTalk case earlier; I can just add that the existing forms of EU support using the European Social Fund and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund might also be relevant if the Irish authorities request this. I believe these are possible ways. Ireland has been using the EGF quite well. This door is open and I would like to ensure that the crisis delegations continue after this year until the end of this period. In the next financial framework, too, the EGF will preserve the capacity to support workers in such difficult cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another element which I should perhaps mention in the context of restructuring: the role of social dialogue and the social partners in cases. I also think it is important not just to speak with the European social partners but perhaps the non-European ones as well – AmCham for example – or rather foreign investors to ensure that there is sufficient understanding of what it means in the EU to follow certain norms, certain standards and certain legislation, and to develop this business culture and social model together.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask Mr Tajani a question. According to the figures available to us, the tourism sector is one of those that has responded best to the crisis, despite having seen a general decline because of it. Additionally, the tourism sector is giving the most encouraging and significant signs of recovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union is the top tourist destination in the world by international arrivals and has huge potential for attracting tourists. Maximising tourism’s role as a driving force for growth and employment is therefore a priority in line with the Europe 2020 objectives. In particular, we need to strengthen links with emerging countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – which account for several million potential European tourists, but we also need to build a professional workforce to deal with these new flows of tourists. What is the Commission doing in this regard?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-651-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, Mr Fidanza, as you know, we are working very hard to maintain Europe’s status as a leading tourist destination, including through international agreements that serve to make Europe ever more attractive. We have signed agreements with China because there is a middle class of millions and millions of Chinese people interested in spending their holidays abroad. We are working very closely with China, as with the countries of South America.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have signed an agreement for a pilot project with South America to develop tourism during the low season. We have had great success in Chile, in the next few days, we will sign an agreement with Brazil during the European Union-Brazil Summit and I shall then also sign an agreement with Argentina. The most important European airlines have joined up to this project, together with all tour operator organisations. We are also working with the Russian Federation because we are convinced that – as we are already seeing in Europe – there are millions of potential tourists in Russia, some of whom are wealthy and have money to spend.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, we all know that tourism provides jobs for many young people and it is important to increase the level of tourism during the low season, which is the reason behind the pilot project with Latin America – a part of the world with which Europe could and should do much more. We are also working very hard to turn big European events, such as the London Olympics and even Milan Expo 2015, into great opportunities for attracting tourists.</p>
      <p sl="it">Everything we do to develop tourism, to help small and medium-sized enterprises and big companies in the tourism sector, means we can attract new young people, because we know that the sector creates jobs for them. Naturally, we need to improve the work of tourism companies a great deal by focusing on the Internet and information technology in order to make them more competitive, since other parts of the world are also taking a keen interest in emerging economies and their increasing numbers of tourists.</p>

      <p sl="it">A survey carried out by the Commission shows that more than 60% of businesses with equal opportunities policies say that these policies have contributed to a greater capacity for innovation and helped create jobs. I would therefore say that we are going to adopt this decision and it is currently being discussed by the Directorates-General. However, any suggestions from Parliament will be warmly welcomed so if you would like to send me your suggestions or ideas, I should be delighted to consider them. As long as the text has not been definitively adopted by the college of commissioners, it can still be amended and any proposal from Parliament will always be warmly received on my part.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my question is directed at Mr Andor. We have seen a huge increase in the number of low-paid self-employed people. They are at significant risk of drifting into old-age poverty if they are unable to afford to contribute to a pension because of their low income or because they are not covered by the pension system in the Member States. The Perulli study, which was carried out on behalf of the European Parliament and the Commission, made it clear that many of these low-paid self-employed workers have a bogus self-employed status and that it was the job of the Commission to come up with a clear definition, clear boundaries and clear principles to prevent bogus self-employment and the risk of old-age poverty in the European Union. What is your response to this?</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree. Bogus self-employment is a serious issue, although not in every Member State in the same way, but it is true that such practices have developed in the recent period by using loopholes or abusing certain opportunities and this needs to be looked at, based on the evidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are particular professions where this is more widespread, for example journalism, where there was also a kind of stimulus to take this route and transform individuals into being self-employed instead of being employed in a company.</p>
      <p sl="en">While there might be perceived short-term advantages for the employee and potentially for other actors involved, I am also convinced that the long-term impact is negative. Pensions are clearly an example where we see the lack of sufficient contributions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important to close the loopholes and to see how the incentives which generated these patterns could be abolished or cut back so that we would face such practices less often. But, as long as such patterns exist, we also have to see how general norms of economic activity and social norms apply to individuals in such forms of employment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to look at another special case, which is the Posting of Workers Directive. The judgments on the Laval, Viking and other legal cases have brought about a situation where bogus self-employment is becoming more widespread and where it is possible to hire people, particularly those who are unaware of the situation and who come from other Member States, as bogus self-employed workers in return for very low pay.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the Commission doing to ensure that the Posting of Workers Directive is better implemented? What needs to be done to improve the Posting of Workers Directive so that we can put a stop to this type of activity?</p>

      <p sl="en">The cases of bogus self-employment and posting of workers are two separate phenomena. Posting is a very important ingredient of the cross-border integrated European economy. What we are preparing now is an Enforcement Directive that will clarify the interpretation and implementation of the existing Posting Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, one of the problems here, which is comparable to bogus self-employment, is the case of the so-called letter-box companies, which is connected to the right of establishment. We have to look at such phenomena to see why they emerged and eliminate the opportunities for such abuse of the existing legislation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, some ten years ago, I was talking to an elderly labour researcher who surprised me by explaining that the jobs and work we lose today are irreversibly gone. What I am trying to say here is that the face of work is changing, the forms of work are changing, and the legal framework that was created under welfare capitalism often does not cover, address or regulate such changes. With Commissioner Tajani, I came upon a problem in connection with self-employment by necessity, where we were unable to reach an agreement regarding a professional law because there was, for instance, neither a uniform interpretation nor a legal definition of entrepreneurs by necessity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">So what we are seeing here is not simply a shift from large companies to small jobs or micro-jobs, and it is not simply posting, part-time work and teleworking replacing traditional forms of employment; there is a multitude of new and creative forms for which we have no rules. Does the Commission therefore intend to prepare some form of instructions or guidance in connection with regulating new types of non-conventional, atypical work? That would be my question.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-663-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The world of labour has indeed gone through a massive transformation due to technology, globalisation and various other factors. We have to study this very thoroughly because some of the atypical forms of work – like fixed-term contracts or self-employment – might be generated by these transformations. To the extent that they bring positive change, new opportunities, more efficiency, and better coordination of private life with work, we have to welcome these changes, but there is also some risk attached. That is what the Commission is looking at.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to how it affects employment policies, I think in the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, we highlighted the need to respond to the challenges of the new times and reflect this transformation. A conference on flexicurity on 16 November, which was mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, also intends to explore the consequences of changing patterns and point to certain directions where the Commission would need to act or bring out new initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I am not against flexibility. I believe that it is rapid technological shifts and an increasingly globalised economy that require us to change both our attitudes and our legislation. The very thing I am missing is that we are very reluctant to respond to these things. It is only once it has become absolutely necessary that we try to give some form of response, and even then it is usually ineffective. So even self-employment by necessity is not simply about social security. There are several situations, from questions of liability to health and safety rules, where one is actually working as an employee, yet all the burdens which, in a case of normal employment, would be shared with the employer, are borne by oneself, together with all the associated risks. I therefore believe that in this case, legal steps, too, would be necessary, and we should expect more active, more specific efforts from the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Let me answer Mr Őry in Hungarian. What I believe is that the Commission should be monitoring all these changes, and this is, in fact, what it is doing. Then, once we come to a point in law making where we must take them into consideration, such as in the aforementioned case of posted workers or in the case of the Working Time Directive, we always take the new factors or circumstances into account. However, quite often it is not necessarily the European Commission that should take it upon itself to act.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are, for example, the social partners. I believe that when we are urging the social partners to cooperate more closely in predicting changes in skills and expertise, and to engage in a new kind of cooperation, we are, in fact, giving modernisation a broader basis, which must also permeate the labour market and the various forms of employment, eventually resulting in a stronger and more competitive European economy.</p>

This involves major challenges, but also significant opportunities. In order to remain competitive, to secure growth and to support the sustainability of our companies, SMEs must take part in international activities. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is convinced of this. This concerns imports and exports, foreign direct investment and, of course, also acting as or using foreign subcontractors.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, only a small proportion of European SMEs are doing business with third countries. A total of 99% of the companies in the European Union are SMEs. However, only 29% of the SMEs in the EU import products, of which 50% import from countries outside the internal market. Only 25% of the SMEs in the EU are involved in exports, of which 50% export to countries outside the internal market. This means that our SMEs are not yet fully integrated into the global market. There are still opportunities to be exploited in this area and we now need to consider how we can encourage SMEs to do more business outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not many SMEs are familiar with the public support programmes, such as the Enterprise Europe Network, or with information resources, such as the Market Access Database and the Export Helpdesk. There are also similar programmes available at a national and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to know what concrete measures the Commission is planning in order to ensure that SMEs are better informed about the available tools and programmes. We would also like to know what the Commission intends to do to make the confusing subsidy system more transparent and clearer for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 December 2009, the Commission intends to include product-specific list rules in the implementing regulations for the Modernised Customs Code, in other words, to make these rules legally binding. The intention is to replace the current regulation, which has proved its worth over several decades and which specifies that the origin of a product is based on its last substantial processing or working, by countless product-specific origin rules for products imported into the EU. We are concerned that this will lead to an increase in red tape and, most importantly, will put SMEs at a disadvantage. We believe that this is not in line with the Small Business Act for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we are calling for a simplified form of this system which is beneficial for SMEs. How does the Commission intend to ensure that safety-related adaptations and changes to the Modernised Customs Code do not conflict with the existing simplified procedure and lead to competitive disadvantages? This is all about the position of SMEs on the world market, which will ensure their continued existence and allow them to safeguard jobs here in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we need to emphasise that the serious crisis in which Europe finds itself means we need to find a way to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to develop.</p>
      <p sl="it">We addressed this in the oral question but we also spoke about it way back in 2008, when I was the rapporteur for Parliament on enhancing the role of SMEs in international trade. More than three years have passed and still we cannot find a way to cut red tape and help SMEs in the internal market, in which regard I would also note that if there is no customs harmonisation, it will be hard for the single market to meet the needs of consumers and European enterprises, but there is not even a solution for ensuring more thoroughgoing and swifter integration of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Back in 2008, Parliament made its voice heard through 437 votes to tell the Commission that we needed harmonised and simplified rules in free trade areas, that we needed to facilitate the removal of excessive barriers, and that we needed to think about creating a system of international courts of arbitration that would be faster and less burdensome, so as to allow SMEs to avoid the delays and the difficulties that a dispute with customs or trade authorities of some third countries entailed.</p>
      <p sl="it">We considered and approved the reduction in the cost of customs procedures by simplifying them and making them transparent. Furthermore, we asked for the harmonisation of international rules, more effective registration of the origin of goods and the modernisation of customs checks, which are essential for avoiding counterfeiting that is detrimental to both consumers and producers. Today, here we are again discussing the same problems, faced with an enormous crisis. Immediate action is required and we hope the Commission will take it.</p>

    <intervention id="2-674-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the honourable Member who tabled this question, because I think it is crucial at this very complicated stage of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we wish to overcome the crisis, we have to support the real economy. To support the real economy, we have to work on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises, which must develop, of course, within the European Union. We have a large internal market of some 500 million citizens, or consumers. At the same time, we must try to work on promoting internationalisation, in order to stop businesses from relocating.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that these 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can truly be an extraordinary lever for stimulating growth at this time. It is our duty to help them and to remove all the obstacles they come up against, because as we well know, even the instruments that we offer them are not enough: a great deal is also done at a national level to help SMEs, with positive initiatives and the Commission’s helpdesks. Meanwhile, the European Commission has decided to appoint an ambassador for small and medium-sized enterprises or a ‘Mr SME’. Tomorrow, there is a meeting of all the small and medium-sized enterprise ambassadors of the European Union and it is quite significant that all 27 Member States have appointed their ambassador very quickly indeed.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is an important step forward, but we need a more robust strategy: the internal market will not suffice; we need to go and prospect elsewhere and, unfortunately, the data we have is not encouraging. Only 25% of SMEs operate outside their own country and only 13% operate outside the European Union. This is too little in comparison with the potential of this network of extraordinary people who create jobs and wealth. That is why we are working to put this internationalisation strategy together in short order.</p>
      <p sl="it">Through it, we have set ourselves a number of tasks: to create an inventory of the instruments available at European, national and regional level; to increase the transparency of these instruments and create coordination between them, because often SMEs have many instruments available to them but do not know which is best to use, while they are also often incompatible or competing with one another, so we need to incentivise greater cooperation; we must rationalise our plans for supporting potential markets, for example, by putting forward guidelines and good practices based on geographical priorities; we must create an online portal that could, for example, be used to store all relevant information by theme and by country.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think I have now answered the first question, so I will move on to the second. Updating customs regulations – as mentioned during the speech introducing the oral question – reconciles the commitment to ease trade together with the use of specific tools for customs checks, such as widespread use of standardised computer systems. In this vein, simplifying and cutting the costs of customs formalities through IT solutions is particularly in the interests of SMEs, while increasing use of computers will allow SMEs to be more competitive and more organised in terms of customs and in all other areas where we need to act to help businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, SMEs can become high-tech businesses, which eases the completion of customs formalities. On the other hand, the ongoing review of the implementing measures of the Modernised Customs Code suggests bearing in mind the specific characteristics of each business, particularly SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moving on to the third question, it is true that SMEs intending to start trading internationally can now benefit from a number of national and European organisations and programmes, yet we also need to achieve greater coherence between the various systems for supporting SMEs, particularly by incentivising synergies and complementarities between existing tools – without creating any overlaps. European, national and regional coordination of programmes to support new or established SMEs – as well as non-EU SMEs – based on the principles of complimentarity, efficiency and sustainability, will be an integral part of the Commission’s strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Question number four: the Commission’s policies aim to help open up international trade and eliminate trade barriers in order to ensure non-discrimination for European businesses, including SMEs. The current economic situation makes these principles even more essential and the Commission believes that public procurement procedures present a fresh opportunity for international trade. That is why we at the Commission are always concerned to include the interests of Member States – including SMEs, of course – in all ongoing bilateral trade negotiations, as well as in the framework of the multilateral agreement on public tenders.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is also currently considering a political instrument designed to show greater symmetry and reciprocity in negotiations for market access. During the impact assessment for this initiative, the Commission will be sure to analyse, in particular, the participation of SMEs in public tenders in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fifth question: the Commission is fully aware of the essential role of small and medium-sized enterprises in supporting and developing the European economy and for getting out of this crisis. Therefore, protecting the interests of SMEs and micro-enterprises – which we also talk about too little – is a priority. In the communication entitled ‘A Strategic Vision for European Standards’, the Commission lays the foundations for increasing the active participation of SMEs in the European standardisation process. In order to implement this strategy, the proposal for a regulation on European standardisation provides for SMEs to be funded to participate in the standardisation process.</p>
      <p sl="it">Likewise, the Commission strongly believes in the use of international standards, mainly those developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation and the International Electrotechnical Commission. European standards must be developed, while remaining mindful of existing international standards so as to facilitate international trade and to help cash-strapped SMEs to adapt their products to the often incompatible standards of countries outside the EU’s internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission has also launched trade and economic talks with the most significant countries for the European economy, namely, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. These talks will also address various standardisation policies in order to come to solutions to target free exchanges of products in future.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I was saying to Mr Theurer just before the start of this sitting, I think it is also very significant that I am signing agreements with the countries of Latin America, which is another extremely interesting market for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, we have standardisation and are working on SMEs in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, but there is also important work going on in North Africa. Many SMEs are being established there, which can bring hope to young people – the leaders of the recent uprising – and also allow our SMEs to enter into joint ventures in these African countries. This will not only help to stabilise the situation, thereby introducing a political aspect to the internationalisation of our SMEs, but also presents a business opportunity because there is already a deep-rooted European presence in these markets. However, in my view, there is still more to be done in stimulating growth and development in Africa, stabilising the Mediterranean area, and cutting the grass beneath the feet of terrorism, fundamentalism and piracy. I therefore predict an important political role for our SMEs in a sensitive area such as the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why working towards internationalisation is becoming a priority for me and I think that this tight collaboration with Parliament can become truly essential for the growth of a sector of the economy that I believe is utterly crucial for getting us out of this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market represents our potential for growth. The Small Business Act and the Single Market Act together act as our engine for reform. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including the smallest companies, are the tool that we can use to achieve growth and employment in the European Union, if we pay attention to the following points. SMEs must come first, both at home and abroad. We need to establish a pathway for SMEs into all the available education and research projects. SMEs are found in all areas of the economy and, if we want to start from the bottom, they are the ones that can generate growth and create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">European companies are currently in a stronger position on the global market than US or Japanese businesses. However, the fact remains that only 25% of SMEs in the EU export their products and services and 50% of these export to third countries. This means that only 13% of SMEs are doing business with third countries. SMEs which sell their products and services to other countries create more jobs. SMEs which do business abroad created 7% more jobs, while those which only do business on their home markets created just 1% more jobs. SMEs that are selling on international markets make better progress. A total of 26% of these SMEs launched products or services which were new to their industry and their country. Only 8% of the other SMEs were able to do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, competitiveness and internationalisation go hand in hand. We have a shortage of young, innovative companies. Only 6% of the new companies founded since 1975 are European and more than 70% are American. We need to catch up. Let us take this opportunity to remove the constraints imposed on SMEs and on the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a turning point and this crisis could lead to situations that would imply the dissolution of the biggest political and institutional project of the tragic century that was the 20th century or, alternatively. a decisive step forward in the process of integration.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is worrying, therefore, to see governments asking to reduce Europe’s financial perspective or acting against the idea of amending the Treaty to strengthen the euro; it is worrying to see all these initiatives that do not aim to help the real economy but the financial economy – the dream of so many irresponsible people who continue to travel back and forth across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also have to play their part in tackling new markets, offering new products, adapting to the whims of the global market, bolstering their capitalisation, investing in research and innovation and showing – as they already are – that in this changing world, nobody can reserve the role of bank of the world for themselves while making others function as their workshop.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are heading towards a world in which today’s emerging big players are capable of being both bank and workshop and will have to face the challenges – including social and environmental challenges – that this world will deliver to them and will also affect us. Our competitiveness, our ability to grow and simultaneously ring-fence employment and security largely depends on our SMEs’ ability to adapt.</p>
      <p sl="it">SMEs have much to gain from a new commercial policy, but to do so they must be strengthened, they must present themselves as consortia on world markets, and they must know how to work together to crack open new markets and meet growing demand, including in sectors that require the huge volumes which we have not been able to provide in the past. They must be supported when they have to defend themselves before the courts of third countries because their patents and trademarks are being violated.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe and its Member States have certainly done a great deal, but the fragmentation of skills and the random distribution of resources in many countries has so far prevented SMEs from working effectively on an international scale, in particular – I would reiterate – when faced with the enterprise shown by our big global competitors. This is what we need to focus our attention and commitment on.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recall meeting an Italian entrepreneur a few years ago in Uzbekistan. He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability.</p>
      <p sl="it">The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, startling leaps in technology and transportation mean the natural environment for a business has ballooned. Past restrictions on interaction and collaboration have been removed by air travel and the Internet. The floodgates have opened up, increasing business opportunities, but this also creates a more crowded market place with greater competition. The Commission’s view of globalisation is that national borders are losing their significance. International competition now starts at home, so the role of the nation state in fostering entrepreneurialism and providing a suitable platform for its industries is more important than ever.</p>
      <p sl="en">To stay ahead of the field, innovation and efficiency are essential. Globalisation not only rewards, but requires inventiveness and flexibility, yet the burden of EU legislation is bogging businesses down. An estimate by the Enterprise Commissioner suggests the burden of regulation costs the EU economy EUR 600 billion a year. From the Working Time Directive to the Agency Workers Directive, small companies are struggling through a bureaucratic quagmire that is stifling growth. A recent poll by ICM (the Institute of Credit Management) revealed that half of SMEs trading with the EU feel that the burden of regulation outweighs the benefits of the single market. 60% of UK businesses would renegotiate our relationship with the EU to return to a simple free trade area. The EU’s general attitude towards capitalism is to regard it with suspicion and contempt. By pushing forward erroneous social and employment policies, unifying welfare support across the Union, and promoting cumbersome rights legislation, the EU protects and rewards the work-shy, while aspiring entrepreneurs are demoralised, demonised and left without a safety net. The greatest enemy to SMEs is the EU itself.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Tajani, it is obvious to all of us that we urgently need new alternatives and new growth in the light of the current economic crisis. During the debt crisis which many Member States are undergoing, it should at last be clear that we cannot afford expensive stimulus packages. If we look at the results of the policies of recent decades, it is obvious that Keynes was not the answer to our problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first question is: what possible alternatives are there? The second question is: where is growth occurring that we can be part of? I am grateful to Mr Karas for so clearly highlighting which areas of the world are currently growing. With regard to what is preventing us from sharing in this growth, I would like to highlight the problems relating to the Modernised Customs Code which Mr Theurer and Ms Muscardini have referred to. I know that the Commission is apparently going ahead blindly and that the concerns raised in a variety of debates in Parliament and also by different committees have unfortunately so far been ignored. However, I would be very grateful if the Commission would finally take our concerns seriously and would consider how some aspects of the rules of origin can be saved.</p>
      <p sl="de">To come back to the question of where growth is happening, the answer is generally outside the European Union. It is clear that there are regions in Europe where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are very successful on global markets. My question is: are we in a position within the European Union to learn from these best practice examples? Is the right response to establish European chambers of commerce in some countries outside the EU? Would it perhaps be better to attempt to improve cooperation with the chambers of commerce, institutions and organisations which have demonstrated that they are able to introduce their SMEs to other world markets? Should we be doing everything we can to ensure that the organisations in the various Member States are better coordinated and can learn from one another more effectively?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, SMEs provide roughly 65 million jobs in the European Union and are a genuine source of innovation and research. Unfortunately, even at European level, fewer than 30% of SMEs are involved in cross-border transactions. Therefore, how can we increase the level of internationalisation of European SMEs without relocating their business to third countries?</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union is devising a new industrial policy and space policy, which means that international cooperation is becoming extremely important. These initiatives, which are crucial for creating jobs and for the European Union’s competitiveness, obviously need adequate funding. We have asked the Commission to allocate the budget required to carry out research into GNSS. This will enable European SMEs to help develop services and applications using satellite-based location services and implement the European space strategy globally.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On this point, we obviously have to promote European standards globally as well. What measures does the Commission envisage for increasing SMEs’ involvement in association agreements between the European Union and third countries or regions in the world, for instance, in light of the European Union-Brazil Summit being held on 4 October this year?</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, in 2009, the Commission published a communication about a clean and eco-efficient economy for European citizens. It suggested seven measures for creating 2 million new jobs as part of the eco-efficient economy by 2020. One of these measures was to harness the full potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. I would like you to tell us, in light of the fight against climate change, what support you are giving to internationalise small and medium-sized European enterprises in order to provide clean solutions for industrial development in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that globalisation has affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and I would say that these effects have certainly been more negative than positive. This is largely due to the iniquitous commercial policy of the European Union, which, in exchange for illusory access to services and big tenders in third countries, has completely given up protecting the domestic economy and manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">The figures cited in the oral question are clear: the benefits of international opportunities are, if they exist at all, exclusively enjoyed by big corporations, while the problems remain for the smallest businesses, which find themselves doubly in difficulty as they suffer from extremely strong and unfair competition at home and the inability to compete properly abroad.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union could help SMEs, but unfortunately not everyone seems to have the same perspective and sensitivity. In the document on the next budget that we shall have to approve, the Council has proposed cutting more than EUR 70 million from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, which also manages Enterprise Europe Network and other instruments designed to support the internationalisation of SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Of course, we have the problem that we import a very large volume of goods, including energy and raw materials, from China, from the Gulf States and from Russia, and all of this has to be paid for. We can only pay for it if we can also export goods. This is why it is so important for us to ensure that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) round is finally brought to a conclusion. We need the Doha round, including the trade facilitations that have already been negotiated, the public tenders, the competition law and the so-called Singapore issues. We must push to ensure that progress is made in the world trade round.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we come to the financial framework 2014-2020 and the old Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which is to be relaunched. We must take particular care in this area to ensure that we promote entrepreneurship. We have too many unemployed people and too few entrepreneurs. This means that we need programmes which once again make it attractive to become an entrepreneur.</p>

Trust forms the basis for business and business creates jobs.</p>

In 2011 alone, many thousands of SMEs in Portugal have already gone out of business because of a lack of support and because of problems accessing credit, specifically for exporting their products. This is because of decreased demand and the reduced purchasing power of the majority of the Portuguese population, resulting from the austerity measures that are being exercised.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issue I would therefore raise with you, Commissioner, is whether the Commission is going to propose amendments to the memorandum that the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank concluded with the Portuguese Government. Only with profound changes to that document will we be in a position to combat the recession, to foster economic growth, to increase the population’s purchasing power, to boost demand and to contribute to preventing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises from continuing to go out of business; that is a central issue.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the small and medium-sized enterprise sector is the backbone of the national economy. If that has unfortunately not been appreciated everywhere, it should apply twice over from now on.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Economic and financial globalisation has brought the world economy to a state where speculative financial groupings and gigantic supranational corporations dominate. This situation brought about the crisis. In my opinion, one of the measures for getting out of the crisis should therefore be to restore the emphasis on local production and smaller economic units within the framework of decentralising economic systems. The EU can play a helpful role in this area, and it frequently does. Small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States are not, however, always aware of the support options. Ladies and gentlemen, you rightly drew attention in your question to the fact that public support programmes and information resources are often little known to businesses. In my opinion, one of the greatest challenges for the Commission is therefore to support and promote these programmes in individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, small and medium-sized enterprises form the core of production in the EU. They thus account for only a small percentage of Europe’s foreign trade balance. One of the reasons for this is the fact that they have not developed sufficient capacities to be able to engage in cross-border trade. They do not know about the public support programmes or the information resources backing them up, and therefore they do not know how to make effective use of this assistance. Additionally, in cross-border trade, they come up against customs barriers and different certification and standardisation rules in other countries. We must therefore look for new effective instruments for helping at least those companies that have the production potential for engaging in international trade, so that they can overcome these administrative barriers. In my opinion, we can effectively open up the possibility of international trade for medium-sized enterprises through the better promotion of public support programmes and information resources, such as a policy of gradually eliminating bureaucratic barriers to foreign trade.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, I reiterate the Commission’s commitment to providing robust support for a policy to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As you know, we are working to prepare a text on internationalisation and therefore, this evening’s debate has been very valuable since I have taken on board the observations made and I also agree with many of the points that have been stressed.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have an important problem in terms of access to finance, but we have already spoken about this in the course of this debate, under this new way of meeting between Parliament and the Commission. It is important for the directive on late payments to be implemented as soon as possible by the Member States and that is why I have asked the European Commission’s Mr SME, Mr Calleja, to insist in tomorrow’s meeting of all the SME ambassadors that this directive must be transposed before the deadline. This is one aspect of access to finance that we are entitled to, but then there is the access to finance that we would like to see.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you know, I have created a small and medium-size enterprise access to finance forum for SMEs, which is already bearing fruit: we have managed to free up the blocked EUR 30 million that was meant to help SMEs during the crisis; we are working on venture capital deals and on a series of initiatives; and the financial perspective 2014-2020 includes a series of specific interventions that should allow SMEs to have greater access to EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am referring in this instance to the large EUR 80 million pot for innovation, some of which will be reserved for SMEs, while there will also be the Eighth Framework Programme and, as discussed with Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, we will be changing the rules on access to financing for SMEs. Alongside this EUR 80 billion fund, there are another EUR 2.4 billion set aside specifically for improving the internationalisation and competitiveness of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, we have already done a number of things. We spoke about multilingualism and reducing the tax burden. I can say that one of my first acts as Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship was to ensure that all the REACH [Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals] documentation was translated into all the languages of the Union. I also reduced the tax on registering REACH substances almost to zero, on a sliding scale from medium to small enterprises and onward to an almost 90% reduction in the tax burden on registration for micro-enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that there is more work to be done and I share the worries of those who have said that the Council often waters down initiatives to help SMEs because there is a policy of budget reduction in place. I do share these concerns and I believe that the Commission and Parliament ought to insist that the Council does not reduce funding for SMEs, particularly in regard to the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of competitiveness on global markets, it is well known that I have always been an ardent supporter of the level playing field, which is different from the principle of reciprocity, and which allows our enterprises to be competitive in the world and also to defend our know-how in situations which we deem to be risky.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think a great deal can still be done, including with regard to exports. We must provide more muscular support for businesses in Europe, because it is true that many SMEs do not know what opportunities the European Union offers. We have a network in place – which I think needs to be strengthened – that is designed precisely to provide information to SMEs. However, even the Members of this House and Commissioners can provide better information to European entrepreneurs in their meetings.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are also helping these entrepreneurs with a network that reaches beyond the borders of the European Union. Indeed, we have begun an important initiative in Beijing to ease access to China for SMEs, so that they can explore an extraordinarily important market. The headquarters that we have established for this initiative is not merely an office with a clerk, but comprises the coordination – under the umbrella of the European institutions – of all the chambers of commerce that operate in Beijing and in China. This is therefore a rather substantial operation; it is not just a formality and I hope that initiatives like this can grow and be put in place in India and other important countries across the world, as is my intention.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of internationalisation, we have signed agreements on standards and relations between SMEs and shall continue to do so. The last one I signed was with Chile and then – to answer Ms Ţicău’s question – we shall be signing one with Brazil during the next EU-Brazil Summit, plus another with Argentina. We are also doing a great deal of work in Latin America, where there is great enthusiasm for strong ties with European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">The figure that was put forward to me as a target to aim for seems like an intelligent proposal. Mr Rinaldi is not here but I shall appropriate it and we shall be sure to use it, perhaps as early as the tabling of the text on the internationalisation of SMEs. I hope I have replied to most of the additional questions that were posed during the debate, having responded – I think – thoroughly to the first five during the first speech. I apologise, Madam President, if I have dragged this out, but the topic is so significant for our economy and there were so many questions that I could hardly stop myself from providing equally thorough answers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, a debate is being held in this House on the situation of homeless people! I should like to begin by paying tribute to all the associations in the community that work all year round to help the most vulnerable people among us, the homeless.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Not having a home to call one’s own is a serious violation of fundamental rights and human dignity. It is the most visible and the saddest link in the chain of poor housing. Above all, it is an unacceptable form of injustice. It is crucial to understand why people end up on the streets, so that proper preventive policies can be put in place. Rather than looking for ways of getting these people off the streets, it is much easier not to plunge them into homelessness in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When are we going to put a stop to tenant eviction? When are we going to stop property speculation? When will we finally realise that rising poverty and insecurity lead to exclusion?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The face of homelessness has changed; the image of the bohemian down-and-out belongs in the past. The reality today is much more complex and much harsher. It is increasingly young people, women, families – in particular migrants – and even poor workers who are without a home.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many types of homelessness. Of course, there are the homeless people that one sees on the floor in the street, in winter, under cardboard boxes, or in tents in public parks, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people live in emergency hostels, in temporary housing or with friends or family; they may even sleep in cars or in insalubrious hotels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with an emergency situation that is becoming worse by the day, the associations are constantly sounding the alarm. However, governments come and go, and the scandalous failure to address the situation continues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is high time the Member States faced up to their responsibilities. It is high time we put a stop to this shameful situation. Europe must strive to help the Member States establish fundamental values and long-term solutions to this situation, because our main duty is to protect the weakest among us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the light of this unacceptable situation, we cannot continue to look the other way, in the same way as people avoid looking at homeless people on the street. What is worse, homeless people are expelled from town centres to the outskirts, far from the stares of businessmen and tourists. However, just because they are out of sight, it does not mean they do not exist! There is no point in hiding the problem; it needs to be resolved today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In one country, which you know well, Commissioner, homeless people are quite simply regarded as criminals. They are forbidden from sleeping on the streets, and are fined if they do, and the police hunt them down as far as underground stations or railway stations, despite the fact that there are no appropriate services in place to accommodate them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The time for communication, false political promises and campaign slogans, as we see in certain States, is now past. That is why, following the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, Parliament is calling on you to implement an integrated strategy aimed at resolving the problem of homelessness by 2020, based on the work that has already been carried out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This strategy should focus on five major objectives: firstly, preventing homelessness; secondly, reducing its duration; thirdly, targeting the most severe types of homelessness; fourthly, improving the quality of services for homeless people; and finally, providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This strategy must be coordinated with national and regional strategies. The results achieved with regard to the indicators developed jointly at European level must be regularly reviewed. Emphasis must be placed on social innovation, in particular, measures aimed at making housing the first step on the path towards social reintegration. Lastly, adequate funding must be guaranteed at both European and national level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, all talk aside, this is an emergency. Action is needed now. This is a question of political will: people do not have to be made homeless. Let us not wait until winter to remember that people die on the streets all year round. It is possible to put a stop to homelessness, and I think that the European Parliament is showing the way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, given the strange and precarious conditions which many people are living and working under, it is not surprising that homelessness is increasingly in the public eye, both in the EU institutions and outside. We have to look at the social consequences of the financial and economic crisis, but in this particular case, it is also important to understand that homelessness existed before, and the crisis just aggravated this situation in a number of Member States. There is, however, also a growing understanding of what is needed to tackle it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States need to continue developing national or regional plans for action to deal with homelessness along the lines identified in the 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion. Of course, the Member States are responsible for much of what needs doing, but the EU can encourage and support the Member States in their efforts – for example, by helping to improve our understanding of the problems and possible solutions, finding better tools to measure them, and disseminating knowledge better.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU funding can also help. The EU structural funds can and should be mobilised to tackle homelessness. The European Regional Development Fund provides funding for social housing for marginalised communities, and should continue to do so in the future. The European Social Fund provides support for the social and labour market reintegration of homeless people. We are currently drawing up the post-2013 financial framework. In this connection, gearing cohesion policy funding to meeting the Europe 2020 headline targets, including for reducing poverty, is vital.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Consensus Conference identified possible avenues and we are following them – for example, improving knowledge and monitoring, applying housing-led approaches, and promoting innovation and experimentation. Similarly, Parliament’s declaration of 16 December 2010 on an EU homelessness strategy highlights a number of priorities, including the need for better statistics.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is actively engaged in work at EU level. Preventing and tackling homelessness is an important aspect of work to tackle social exclusion and poverty under the Europe 2020 strategy. It is also a key area of work under the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, which covers areas highlighted at the Consensus Conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have just commissioned a new study on the links between homelessness and migration. We are continuing our work on homelessness indicators in conjunction with the Social Protection Committee. We have promoted social innovation based on housing-led approaches which we would like to see applied more widely.</p>
      <p sl="en">What matters now is putting all our energy and resources into carrying out the tasks identified at EU level so we get results quickly, rather than introducing new procedures or steering structures in the form of high-level groups or committees. Last month, I met key stakeholders to talk about how to step up our work on homelessness and what framework would help ensure that enough attention and energy are put into doing what is needed. This dialogue continues and will also be followed up by action.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, our Socialist fellow Members decided to address a question about homelessness to the Commission, and to submit a motion for a resolution alongside that question. The Group of the European People’s Party considers the question apt and justified. We also find the motion for a resolution that has been put forward to be worthy of support, and we do indeed support it. We naturally also agree that homelessness is one of the most extreme forms of poverty, of abject poverty, and we believe that in the 21st century, such a thing is unacceptable. We must also realise – and in this respect, the correct approach is inherent in the question – that we need to address this issue in a well-coordinated, cooperative and integrated manner, both in individual Member States and in terms of the cooperation between them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">After all, homelessness is a terminus of sorts on the road to a person’s downfall, to his becoming outcast and isolated. It is a terminus where one finds oneself in a vicious circle: homeless people cannot find work. If they cannot find work, they have no chance of ever leaving homelessness behind. The problems then begin to accumulate: physical and mental deterioration, illness and often the formation of distinct, peculiar communities, as well as criminality and other problems. To break free from all this is obviously only possible through concerted efforts, and also programmes, in various fields: social services, health care, education and job creation. Any successful examples – and there have been successful examples in individual countries in the past, and even now there are some remarkable efforts – should be collected, because as they say, best practices should be brought together, and drawing on these it would be reasonable and useful for a European strategy to be formulated as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">For our part, we therefore welcome the question and welcome and support the motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, this is the second time that the European Parliament has come together at short notice to question you on the issue of homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We did so in 2008, when the crisis had only just begun. Here we are back together today, in 2011, with a declaration that we drafted in 2010 and which reminds you of the urgent need to address this scandal within the European Union, this area which, in global terms, remains an area of wealth and so-called civilisation, and yet where, sadly, homelessness is rife in every single one of our towns. All the local councillors tell us that they take action day after day to help these people in distress whom the crisis has hit hard, be it in Athens, Berlin, Paris or Helsinki.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Can we accept the fact that a Union founded on solidarity is allowing homelessness, which is the most obvious symptom of poverty and social exclusion, to develop here and there? I remember the debate we had: ought the poverty eradication objectives to be integrated into the EU strategy? Would this be the responsibility of the European Union? I do not wish to relaunch the legal debate, since the bases have been established. They are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have repackaged them as a political objective for the EU strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, it is your responsibility, and that of the College, to harness the tools at the disposal of the European Union so that the Stability and Growth Pact does not lead, in future, to indiscriminate cuts in any possible funding available to the services that help these people, those that carry out exemplary work in the community, those whom we call social workers, whose job is made almost impossible today, as demonstrated by the resignation in France of the founder of Samu social, Xavier Emmanuelli, which generated a certain amount of publicity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission can also intervene to encourage the Member States, not to apply the rules of competition to social housing, but to finance social housing, so that homelessness is no longer an urgent issue in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, although combating poverty and social exclusion is mainly the responsibility of national governments, the EU can play a coordinating role, and I believe it should, particularly in relation to homelessness. This is in line with the 2020 strategy. In many cases, however, there is no need to reinvent the wheel; there are many examples of best practice across the EU. That information needs to be collected and disseminated far more widely than it is being at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Can the Commissioner outline more of the plans for what the Commission is about to do under the homelessness strategy in terms of collating that information? Also, how much information is already available from Member States on the causes of homelessness? We know that three million people across the EU have no fixed home of their own. Why is this? How much do drug and alcohol problems contribute to street homelessness? In one survey in the UK, for instance, 40% of people questioned had drug problems, 49% alcohol problems and 35% mental health problems. Now you might say that adds up to over 100%. Of course it does, because a lot of people had more than one: some of them had drug, alcohol and mental health problems combined. How much data do we already have from different Member States on this issue?</p>
      <p sl="de">I know there are many projects that are trying to tackle these issues, like one in my constituency funded under the Daphne Programme dealing with women rough sleepers. Also, there are many projects dealing with domestic violence, which of course can, in turn, lead to homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I believe we are, all of us, asking for here is a coordinating approach across the EU. First and foremost, we need to know what is already being done and how we can assist in the development of national and regional strategies which would encourage Member States to set a clear date to end street homelessness, which we called for in the written declaration that, as Karima Delli mentioned, was adopted on 16 December last year.</p>
      <p sl="de">Homelessness has never been a political priority; it has never been a popular subject. Maybe because there are not many votes in it, but that is one of the reasons why it is important to involve all people, from all parties and no party. We must involve national, regional and local policy makers, homeless service providers and, above all, people who have experienced homelessness themselves. We need to work towards a homeless strategy that really works: a homeless strategy for the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I have particular reason to speak in this debate, because this issue is, for me personally, a very important one. My interest is based on a family tradition. In the 19th century, one of my forebears founded shelters and hostels for the homeless in the Polish city of Kraków.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This shows the problem to be a very old one, very much older than the European Union. Then – as now – the state also often shrugged its shoulders helplessly. Today, of course, we can keep saying – and it is true – that this is the responsibility of the European Union’s Member States and not the Union itself. However, I think that moral and ethical considerations do allow the European Parliament to point out what should be done and to persuade the Member States to coordinate action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The crisis has shown something which was once kept shamefully hidden. The crisis, like water which has subsided, has shown the truth of the matter – it is, in fact, a problem which, if not common, is certainly growing all the time. We have spoken here, of course, about speculation in the property market. It is also necessary to mention the banking and lending system in general, as it has often been the cause of people who borrow ending up, sooner or later, on the street – they become homeless. This is a much wider problem, that of a modern civilisation which is engulfed by consumerism and is creating an ever greater underclass of people who cannot cope with this situation. We should also keep this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to say that this issue transcends political divisions. We can all make the effort to speak together, stressing with one voice the moral obligation to help these people, all the more so because there are increasing numbers of them in every country, both rich and poor.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the issue concerning homeless people constitutes an unacceptable violation of fundamental human rights, which is why effective measures are needed. As Parliament’s declaration of 16 December 2010 confirmed, it is crucial to prioritise actions promoting social inclusion, so as to ensure that no one sleeps rough and that even the time they may spend in temporary shelter is strictly limited to the time needed to provide them with suitable housing: their own housing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call on the Commission to draft an ambitious homelessness strategy and to support the Member States in drafting effective national strategies, including, wherever necessary, Union funding to finance housing projects for marginalised groups in the Member States. However, above all, it is crucial that the issue concerning the homeless be integrated with the various relevant policy areas – specifically, the economic, financial and social areas – so as to guarantee jobs with rights, quality public services and decent pensions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If this does not happen, with the neoliberal and anti-social policies, and the so-called austerity plans being imposed on some Member States, there will be an increase in the number of people who do not earn enough to be able to afford a home, which will lead to an increase in the number of people who are homeless or unable to pay for their electricity, gas, water, sewerage or rent, or who are unable to pay their mortgages. That is why special attention needs to be paid to this situation, once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, homelessness has long weighed on civilised and cultured society in Europe. Street homelessness is the most visible and most extreme form of poverty and social exclusion. There are many reasons for getting into this situation. These often include personal factors, such as the breakdown of a close relationship, domestic violence, loss of employment, illegal migration, use of addictive substances or complete loss of ability to earn at least some level of income.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Consensus Conference on Homelessness in December last year attempted to find an answer to the question of how to deal with this distressing phenomenon, which is frustrating to any decent person. The fundamental and primary measure should be one of prevention, by reducing the threat of eviction to a minimum where there are personal problems. Another temporary measure should be to ensure access to temporary accommodation for the time it takes to overcome short-term problems. After overcoming the worst problems, the people affected should be assisted in their own best efforts towards securing accommodation that is cheap and basic but, at the same time, stable. It will definitely be necessary to think about other assistance for them as well, on top of accommodation. This too, however, should be provided primarily on the basis of their active cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate on the issue of homelessness. While I recognise that this is an issue for the Member States, it is also an issue to which this Parliament and this House can give greater political importance through this kind of recognition and this kind of debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2010-2011, in my constituency in Northern Ireland, the number of people who registered as homeless increased by 8% on the previous year. In 2010, there were over 38 000 applicants on the social housing waiting list. I know that there are a wide range of reasons for the increases in both housing waiting lists and in cases of homelessness. These can be both social and economic, as we have already heard very eloquently espoused in this House tonight. What is absolutely vital is that we give adequate support, guidance and training to those who find themselves in this position, as well as supply good quality and affordable accommodation.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many initiatives in Northern Ireland to tackle the problem of homelessness. In the past three years, over EUR 200 million have been spent on social housing. I am particularly encouraged by an emphasis on those young people who find themselves homeless, many through difficult problems and some through no fault of their own. I can look to some facilities which have opened just in the last year which are good examples of helping young people to gain long-term independence through the provision of temporary accommodation and adequate support services. These are the kinds of schemes that we should be looking at, and are the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, homelessness is one of the most poignant challenges amid the economic crisis ravaging Europe, and it is frequently associated with multidimensional social and health problems.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Homelessness cannot be defined completely unambiguously: it is a phenomenon that differs greatly in content at different times and in different countries. This makes it difficult to make a comparative estimate of the number of homeless people, though that cannot be any sort of excuse for the absence of a homelessness strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Social policy must fall within the competence of the Member States, but we need coordination and an exchange of best practices. Fortunately, national homelessness strategies have been established in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my country, Finland, the programme to reduce long-term homelessness has been based on the application of the Housing First principle. According to this, the organisation of accommodation and the improvement in personal life management would, for example, reduce the need for substance abuse and medical services, and motivate many people with substance abuse problems, for example, to seek rehabilitation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The new model focuses far more attention than before on the prevention of homelessness and its permanent reduction, rather than the development of temporary dwellings or accommodation. There is also an understanding that subsidised housing in the context of the existing housing stock will be significantly cheaper for society than having to deal with the consequences of homelessness in hospitals, drug rehabilitation centres or prisons.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the flagship initiative aimed at combating poverty in the current context of budgetary pressure on the Member States and the Union, I am convinced that Europe’s economic recovery will be effective only if the focus is purely on budgetary restraint.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and poverty reduction in particular, are vital. Social policies cannot take second place: they must be conducted alongside budgetary restraint policies. Therefore, as well as ensuring that citizens have a decent quality of life, poverty reduction has significant economic consequences, including that of support for European consumption.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Homelessness is certainly one of the most advanced stages of poverty for impoverished and socially excluded individuals. Once they have lost their home, it becomes even more difficult for individuals whose main concern is knowing where they are going to sleep that night to re-enter the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore support all of the measures recommended in the oral question and the resolution and, in particular, the idea of an affordable housing supply. In this respect, social housing is the responsibility of the Member States, which are free to plan this service of general interest as they see fit. Attention should be drawn to this aspect of the Treaties, so that the Member States are never hampered in their efforts to combat homelessness by rules on State aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all these reasons, this resolution must be endorsed. I hope that it will be adopted by a large majority so that I can refer to it in my forthcoming report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, reference has been made to the EU 2020 target of lifting 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion by 2020. We should recognise reality here: the reality is that instead of approaching that target, we are moving further and further away from it, and it is a direct result of the cuts and attacks that are imposed on working people right across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">These austerity policies are forcing millions into poverty and putting many at risk of homelessness. In Greece in the past two years, for example, homelessness has risen by 25%. In Ireland, too, services for the homeless have been cut and face outsourcing and privatisation. This means fewer resources for the most vulnerable in our society. The wages and conditions of those providing those services have also been attacked.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crazy logic of a system built on profit, rather than people’s needs, is exposed in Ireland whereby you have 48 000 families on the housing waiting lists and 300 vacant housing units, and yet they are not used. They are not taken into public ownership. They are not used to provide homes for people who need it. Instead, you have a reliance on the private sector and because of that, only 296 out of a target of 1 200 housing units were secured in Ireland over the past year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of more money for the bankers and the bond holders, I call for a massive increase in funding to care for those who find themselves homeless. The basic human right to housing must be made a reality and policies such as the Housing First approach should be implemented to provide people with homes immediately.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome this resolution on homelessness, since we have a duty to remind people of how extremely urgent the matter is.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us note, first of all, that what was a priority yesterday is even more of a priority today. The lack of a definition and of reliable statistical indicators on homelessness cannot prevent us from concluding that, partly as a result of the crisis, the number of people living below the poverty line has increased, according to Eurostat, from 79 million in 2009 to an estimated 84 million in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, three years ago, our Parliament, in an effort to eradicate poverty, called on the Member States to solve the problems faced by homeless people by 2015. Today, have we even partially achieved our objective? Did the Member States really take advantage of 2010, the year for combating poverty, to actually address this major source of insecurity, which has become a chronic emergency? If I may say so, I genuinely doubt it, and I deeply regret it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I wish to stress the need to develop a comprehensive multisectoral strategy on homelessness, because poverty and homelessness certainly do exist, but there are also family problems, health issues, various addictions and personal vulnerability. We need a comprehensive, effective, ambitious and tailored approach that caters for individuals, the different paths they take and the significant life events they face. This is a fundamental right, to say the least, and one that many very vulnerable people are deprived of.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to ask my fellow Member the following question. Perhaps there was a mistake in translation, but I understood from my colleague’s speech that 84 million European citizens are homeless. Does this mean that one in five European citizens is homeless? Perhaps they are vulnerable to the risk of poverty, but are not homeless as such.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, of course I, too, find it important for the Commission to take action in coordinating, monitoring and assisting Member State homelessness policies in all those areas mentioned in the draft Parliamentary resolution and at the Consensus Conference on Homelessness. I would, however, like to highlight two aspects which, being new phenomena, require special treatment. On the one hand, as a social consequence of the crisis, we have severe and long-term unemployment and the debt crises of families, the inability of many to repay their home loans. This is particularly crippling for those who took out loans in continuously appreciating foreign currencies, especially in Swiss francs.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Both of these carry the risk of people losing their homes, and require special preventive measures, including measures such as a review of whether the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive needs to be tightened at a European level. The other phenomenon I would like to mention is that we see with increasing frequency the involvement of the police in dealing with homelessness: discrimination against homeless people, their removal from public spaces in ways that violate their human dignity, and their being threatened with penalties and detention. As stated several times today, homelessness is an extreme form of poverty. This needs to be accorded special attention within the European platform against poverty, and its human rights implications must also be treated as a priority.</p>

    <intervention id="2-711-000" speaker_id="28407" name="Willy Meyer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, I know that the current tendency of economic policy in the European Union towards adoration of the free market and capping costs has resulted in millions of victims and the dismantling of the European social state which is a goal to build towards. The US has opted for public investment; here we are doing the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, as part of this attack on social welfare, homeless people are being targeted, but the response is merely good intentions. I shall cite an example in my country, Spain: unemployment is attacking Spain as in no other country; it is higher here than in any other country of the European Union. There are people without jobs, people with mortgages, who have to pay their mortgage every month but cannot pay it; therefore, the bank cuts them off, takes away their homes, but they still have to go on paying the debt to the bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">This seems immoral to me. I know that in other EU countries, this does not happen; that is, repossession is legal: they give up the property and once it has been surrendered, all debts are cancelled. It seems to me that what is done in Spain is immoral, and I urge the European Commission to bring in laws so that we have common legislation which enables us to offer this kind of protection to citizens who have mortgages and who have no salary enabling them to continue paying the mortgage and who, even after their homes have been taken away, still have to carry on paying off every month a debt which makes no sense from an ethical point of view.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, I believe that we cannot stop at good intentions, as we are aware that the most important thing would be to change this neoliberal economic policy which is leading us to the destruction of the social sphere within Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-712-000" speaker_id="96770" name="Joanna Katarzyna Skrzydlewska" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the problem of homelessness remains unsolved in Europe. The kind of people who are homeless is also changing. Up to now, the stereotype of a homeless person was considered to be a middle-aged man, but now an increasing number of homeless people are young women, victims of violence and immigrants. The most highly visible and extreme form of homelessness is where homeless people live on the street, although homelessness can also take on other forms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The phenomenon of homelessness is having an adverse effect on whole societies, so despite the efforts of the Member States in this area, it is essential for action to be taken at EU level. The Member States not only have different definitions of homelessness, but they also use different methods of collecting and presenting data. Therefore, for the Union to be able to create a common framework for supporting and monitoring the work of the Member States in developing a strategy for combating homelessness, it is essential to solve these problems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, I would like, today, to put several questions to the Commission. The European Consensus Conference on Homelessness held in December of last year divided the causes of this phenomenon into many different categories reflecting different origins. Does the Commission intend, as part of work on the strategy, to present solutions which take into account differences in the circumstances which have rendered people homeless? Does the Commission plan to include non-governmental organisations in work on the strategy, and if so, how? How would the Commission like to involve non-governmental organisations in the fight against homelessness, apart from the measures which these organisations are already using as part of their official roles? How does the Commission intend to measure the strategy’s effectiveness after it has been put into operation, in view of the fact that the situation of homeless people is different in different Member States?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in December, together with more than half of the Members here in the plenary of the European Parliament, I called on the Commission to adopt an effective and comprehensive EU strategy for combating street homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We are therefore now asking the Commission what has actually happened since then, what measures you have adopted, and whether you would like to cooperate with us on such a strategy. A strategy to combat street homelessness should include several elements. It should have a clear and measurable objective, and it should cut across all the relevant policies. It should have clear dimensions within the framework of housing policy, and it should also take account of the nature of the population, whether from the perspective of the impact of immigration, for example, or the ever-deepening poverty resulting from the economic and social crisis in the Member States of the European Union. Reporting on the strategies for combating homelessness should be included in the national strategic reports submitted within the framework of the open coordination method in the social area. I would therefore like to call on the Commission one more time to ensure the implementation of effective measures and to work with us on a specific strategy for combating street homelessness.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, 8% of Europeans live in extremely impoverished conditions and cannot afford to meet their basic needs and thus live a decent life. Thousands of them, including a growing number of young people, women and children, sleep on the streets; others sleep in temporary and insalubrious accommodation. Without a home, most of the other fundamental rights are but a pipe dream; this is especially true of the right to work and to live as a family unit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, Commissioner, you have told us that the crisis has made the situation worse within the European Union, even though it is the world’s leading economic power. The austerity policies are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest. You have listed the tools available to the European Union one by one. All this fine talk aside, what specific policies have the Member States actually implemented, when they are not even capable of providing statistics on the subject? Worse, some Member States are criminalising poverty more and more.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When will the resources needed to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights finally be provided, especially for those who need it most? If we started with that, it would make all the fine talk about human rights and social Europe more credible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the number of homeless people, as well as the number of people living below the poverty line, has continued to rise in recent years in several Member States. As everyone predicted, the economic, financial and social crisis, and a rise in unemployment, has exacerbated this problem. Everyone also agrees that this phenomenon runs counter to important European Union values: respect for human dignity and respect for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In my country, for example, which is subject to severe austerity measures, the concept of ‘homeless’ under the national plan includes people needing help to put food on the table. The number of people seeking help to feed themselves has increased by over 20% since 2008. There has been a noticeably higher increase in deprived families and individuals, whose living situations have changed as a result of unemployment as well as bank debts. That is just one example illustrating the seriousness of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Last year, Parliament adopted a written declaration on a European Union homelessness strategy. With this declaration, Parliament warned of the need for the European Union to equip itself with a strategy supported by national and regional strategies, with the long-term goal of putting an end to people sleeping rough and to long-term homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="pt">National strategies should focus on preventative measures, but also on specific actions for improving the quality of the services provided to the homeless and on making affordable housing available. Naturally, this European strategy should also be compatible with the Member States’ social housing policies. We paid due attention to the Commissioner’s words and have made a note of his analysis of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude by calling on the Commission to give strong impetus to coordinating the actions of the Member States and regional authorities to combat this social injustice.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I do not think this is the first debate we have held on this topic in Parliament. We had it in 2008, 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion when we put forward a written declaration, and we are now putting an oral question to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">What I mean is that, firstly, Parliament has always been concerned about this problem, which is a real one, because one often hears it said that we are preoccupied with institutional issues in which people are not interested. Institutional issues are important, but the issue of poverty is a genuine one and those of us who are present here tonight are demonstrating our concern.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, it is true that – as the Commissioner has said – the action plans are essentially national plans. This is so. However, it is true that we can also do things at a European level. We did this – as Ms Berès will recall – when, at the insistence of this Parliament, we included the reference to social exclusion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the struggle against poverty among the EU’s goals.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that very soon, we shall have the opportunity to take concrete action. I am referring to the debate and vote on the European Union budgets. These will take place very shortly and I think this will be an opportunity for demonstrating our commitment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third point I should like to make, Madam President, is that it is very important to combat social exclusion and to combat poverty, but it is even more important to respect human dignity. A person suffering from poverty is one who possesses all the fundamental human rights, and we need to recognise this. Recently, I watched a film on Father Brezinski which I would recommend that my colleagues see, because this film demonstrates that the fight against inequalities is closely linked to the fight for dignity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Madam President, I would not wish to overlook one fact. From certain speeches, it would seem as if the defence of the European social model were the exclusive heritage of one particular political group in this Chamber. This is not the case. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in all groups place great importance on the European social model, because this defines us, and because this is part of our identity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I think that together – and both this question and the resolution show this – we will continue to fight for it to remain so.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, a person, however poor he may be, who sees a homeless person as he is walking down the street thinks that he is worlds apart from him. It does not enter a poor person’s mind that he may at some point become homeless, and yet the difference is minimal, a hair’s breadth. That becomes clear in times of economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">The number of homeless people is growing at an alarming rate. We can feel it and I use that word advisedly, because there are no statistics. However, everyone in my country knows what is happening and can see what is happening in their street and in their neighbourhood. Where there is economic crisis, poverty follows. Where there is poverty, slowly but surely, a lack of jobs and work follows and ‘suddenly, a person becomes homeless. We need to combat this. We all need to help, not just each Member State separately. We need a European strategy, a European umbrella, if we are to achieve the ultimate objective which, in my opinion, should be the social reintegration of homeless people.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I fully support this oral question and this resolution because we are faced with a problem that is unworthy of Europe, unworthy of the values that we uphold, and unworthy of the average standard of living that we have in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crisis has significantly exacerbated the problem of homelessness, but I believe it is important to recognise, today, that we all face the same threat: any European can fall victim to homelessness in the future. The first tool that we can use is, of course, the European Social Fund, which enables people to integrate and reintegrate into the labour market, to enter work and to adapt to new jobs, and unemployed people to return to work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, beyond this – and in my capacity as Chair of the Working Group on the European Social Fund and Progress – I wish to stress that the Progress programme can, and must, help us to act more quickly in resolving this problem: through prevention, firstly, but also by defining, together, indicators to provide us with a genuinely effective policy or approach regarding access to housing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Good practices exist at European level to achieve these objectives. I believe that, together – in the Commission and in our Working Group, as well as in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, with our Chair, Ms Berès – we must work out what is being done and what works in the Member States, which strategies are genuinely forward-looking, and whether individual support, coaching, a one-to-one approach and personal supervision can really be important factors in enabling us to resolve these problems, which are unworthy of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, homelessness continues to be an issue for the whole of Europe, exerting an adverse effect not only on those with nowhere to live but also on society. It is well known that during winter months, large cities in Member States are faced with a shortfall in the number of places available in shelters specially set up for homeless people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Combating homelessness has become a priority, being a major part of the European social protection and social inclusion strategy, especially within the new post-Lisbon Europe 2020 strategy. Although progress has been made by many Member States in combating this problem, support and coordination of policies at EU level is required. It is not only the definition of homelessness which varies greatly between Member States. The way in which data is collected and reported is also very different.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union must produce a common framework for supporting and monitoring Member States as they draw up policies aimed at combating homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that prevention is the most cost-effective way to combat homelessness. Emphasis must also be placed on the integration of disadvantaged groups into the workplace: young people, the elderly, women, people with disabilities and minorities groups. The integration process must also take into account the aspects relating to family life. Particular attention must be focused on deprived regions and on using the European Regional Development Fund to build social housing for deprived persons.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, one of the five objectives of the European Union’s new Europe 2020 strategy is to bring 20 million of the people living in the European Union out of poverty. The data and statistics on poverty from 2009 are simply alarming: as many as 113 million people are affected by poverty and social exclusion. The situation is particularly worrying in that it may become worse because of the financial and economic crisis. Homelessness is an extremely drastic aspect of poverty and, what is worse, it is inherited, which makes it more difficult to tackle and control.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I welcome all the efforts being made in this area by the European Parliament, which is making a particular point of fighting this phenomenon. In existing initiatives, clearly specified stipulations have been made concerning the question of control and prevention, including eliminating street homelessness by 2015 and fighting the causes of homelessness by formulating suitable housing and social policy. The success of the homelessness strategy at European level will depend on how the Commission fulfils the role it has been given of mobilising the Member States as quickly as possible to build effective and comprehensive strategies for tackling and controlling homelessness. The success of the project will, in large measure, also be decided by the degree of openness to working with the people affected by homelessness and with non-governmental organisations and other social partners.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The creation of an effective homelessness policy is, therefore, dependent on interinstitutional cooperation and proper and effective implementation of existing legislation. Only a shared vision on policy and the engagement of both the European Union and the Member States can bring about full realisation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

We encounter homeless people every day outside shopping centres, in subways and on the streets, neglected, dirty and hungry. Solidarity is a characteristic of the European Union. An awareness that all people have the right to a dignified life, and an understanding that society as a whole has an interest in eliminating poverty should draw all levels of society into eliminating this phenomenon. There is space here, in my opinion, for individuals, as well as the public and private sector. The planned public awareness campaign should help towards this, but the time has come for us to introduce a pan-European system of cooperation between individual states.</p>

A number of problems come together here, for example, employment, financial, family or psychological difficulties, which force such people into a state where they are trapped. A joint effort of the local and regional bodies of the European institutions is thus becoming an essential precondition for creating a permanent solution to this problem. Structural funds directed towards a strategy for creating accommodation for socially disadvantaged groups within the population should also be expressly incorporated into a solution to the problem of homelessness, and the specific use of these funds must then be monitored and assessed. I would like to end by expressing the conviction that homelessness is incompatible with the values of a modern, inclusive society and of the EU, and I therefore applaud the fact that the 2020 strategy, the main aim of which is to protect at least 20 million people from the threat of poverty and social exclusion by 2020, also creates space for solving the issue of homelessness.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to make a few suggestions to the Commission which might offer solutions to this problem.

      <p sl="ro">The next measure is to extend and use structural funds, such as the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, to analyse the problem of homelessness and, in particular, to build permanent housing where it is needed, following the Finnish ‘Housing First’ model, which has proven that a EUR 14 000 reduction is achieved in costs for every beneficiary supported.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to express a view that has not been heard here yet. If the family is functioning properly, homelessness is a marginal issue. We must help people who have lost everything and who cannot help themselves. This Parliament, however, continues to adopt many laws that weaken the family. The Commission and Parliament do everything so that mothers entrust the care of their children as quickly as possible to strangers in collective facilities. This comes at the expense of developing relationships. We talk about the work-life balance, but we refuse to recognise the value of the work of women who care for children, close relatives or the household. When someone ends up on the street, we propose resolutions, set up committees, order studies and think up strategies. However, we lose sight of the fact that building up and holding onto a home takes time, effort and energy. It is no easy task. If no one does it, both the family and the home will fall apart. Some manage to keep a roof over their head, but some do not.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the alarming rise in the number of homeless people and the social polarisation in terms of housing standards in the last decade pose major challenges for European states. One condition required to reduce the impact of this problem is to coordinate the strategies for tackling exclusion due to homelessness by integrating national, regional and local levels so that decisions are made as closely as possible to those affected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another measure which is just as important is to make more efficient use of the European funds earmarked for building housing and to channel them into social housing. Campaigns such as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, intended to encourage the exchange of good practices, can play a key role in raising public awareness and responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also like to mention the need for national strategies targeted at vulnerable people, aimed at improving their living conditions by removing the barriers preventing their participation in the labour market, improving the quality of social services provided and increasing the supply of affordable housing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, does the Commission intend to consider making use of housing units which have never been occupied since the onset of the crisis? Does it intend to tie in its strategy on homelessness with efforts to relieve financially distressed households in difficulty due to servicing mortgage debt, as these are also at risk of becoming homeless? Indeed, many people in that situation have become homeless. Does it intend to study the relation between mortgage indebtedness, land planning and real estate regulation across the EU?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the problem of homelessness has recently grown worse and spread due to the economic crisis. These people are particularly vulnerable. The lack of a European policy promoting the social integration of this group is a breach of their fundamental human rights. I support the notion of adopting a strategy aimed at improving the situation of homeless people. The EU must protect the right to a life of dignity and to participate fully in a society including all citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must point out that exclusion causes a form of discrimination motivated by social inclusion. It can have a significant impact on the physical and mental integrity of the people affected. I think that structural funds need to be allocated at EU level, which would help resolve this problem. The funds can be used, in particular, for building permanent social housing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, from a strictly biological perspective, being healthy is not the privilege of the rich, just as being ill is not a typical characteristic of the poor. However, in social terms, this statement tends to prove to be false.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are, of course, European institutions and bodies which provide medical care to deprived groups of people, which also include the homeless. However, we have to note with dismay that it does not reach the level of the care provided across the Atlantic, either in terms of the quality of medical procedures or the programmes available.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This European homelessness strategy perhaps ought to be reviewed now, both from this perspective and specifically from the perspective of providing medical care to the homeless.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Europe suffers from a solidarity deficit. I believe that, until this is really turned around, this can not only destroy the European social model, but can also destroy the European Union itself. I think this has to be taken very seriously. Without much greater solidarity, we will not be able to end the financial crisis. It is true that, until this financial crisis is over, Member States – especially those on the periphery of the European Union – will continue to drift towards social crisis and potentially social catastrophe. Homelessness is one aspect of this very negative tendency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful to the honourable Members, because this debate confirmed that the House is committed to addressing homelessness and housing exclusion. So is the Commission. The Europe 2020 strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion covers homelessness and housing exclusion. This problem is not about an absolute shortage of housing in Europe. This is mainly a distributional question. Homelessness has increased in Member States which experience population decline, so it is not about an absolute shortage of housing. It is wrong to consider poor or homeless people as criminals. Member State governments and local governments have to intervene to correct this very severe market failure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Homelessness and housing exclusion are primarily Member State competences, and some are very jealous of this. EU housing markets differ significantly in terms of tenancy conditions, quality of housing, services for the homeless, and so on. What we need is more policy coordination, as Liz Lynne pointed out, information exchanges and statistical evidence, and also a better exchange of best practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the Commission has already embarked on working along the lines which have been proposed, such as striving to improve the knowledge base, supporting and promoting innovation, and the housing-led approach. More is planned. I believe that priority must be given to the integrated approaches which Mr Őry explained. I would like to open doors for this under the new umbrella of social innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This problem also connects with human rights, or the lack of respect for human rights. This has to be looked at from various angles and also from the legislative side. It is truly unacceptable if, for example, as a result of the financial crisis, people who took out a mortgage loan lose their apartment or house, and then still owe money to the bank after losing the house. We have to look at what can be done in this area to improve the legislative framework in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Commission is in dialogue with stakeholders to ensure that the profile and framework of work in this field is suitable. We have to continue working with the Member States. Some of them, instead of working on a social housing strategy, open the way for evictions. I will have an opportunity in Kraków in October, at the Convention of the European Platform against Poverty, which is part of the Europe 2020 strategy, to continue this dialogue and to mobilise the Member States, as requested by the honourable Member, and also other stakeholders in working together in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also continue working with the NGOs. However, I am sure you are also aware that not all NGOs share the approach of the Consensus Conference. In this continued dialogue, I therefore very much count on the support of this House in order to address homelessness and improve housing conditions in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">The fact that the vast majority in Europe have homes/houses does not mean that a problem of homelessness does not exist. All of us know that when we walk around our capitals and major towns, we still see people sleeping on the sidewalks, huddled up in cardboard boxes. Perhaps my country (Malta) is one of the few countries where homelessness does not exist any more. President Mandela once said that he wanted every family in Africa to have at least one room to live in. Compared to Africa and other continents, the problem of homelessness in the EU is not a major problem. On the other hand, for those persons who do not have a home (even if the percentage is low), it is a tragedy. That is why we need a strategy across the EU for the homeless. It is not enough that every country has its own way of dealing with the problem, some more successfully than others. If we believe in a real union of European countries, we have to have a strategy for homelessness which goes beyond the borders of individual countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Homelessness is a serious problem. We should make use of best practices in our fight against homelessness. We must do this because human dignity and its protection is one of the European Union’s fundamental values. Luckily, we have many successful examples of working with the homeless. This should be done not only by non-governmental organisations but perhaps – or even first and foremost – by local authorities. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, local governments cannot, and must not, avoid this problem. Therefore, I urge local authorities, including those in my home town of Poznań, to take the question of homelessness seriously and give it the necessary attention. The aim of every policy at every level should be to serve the common good and to serve the people, and is there anyone who needs public help more than the person who, for various reasons, has found himself on the street?

      <p sl="pl">The phenomenon of homelessness continues to affect people in all of the EU’s Member States. Therefore, the European Union should take united action to coordinate policies on homelessness at European level. The problem of homelessness requires a more strategic approach, which can be ensured only by the cooperation of all the Member States. I endorse the European Parliament’s call for the development of an ambitious, integrated EU strategy, underpinned by national and regional strategies with the long-term aim of reducing the magnitude of this dangerous phenomenon. At the same time, while I appreciate the importance of monitoring and reporting work, I call for the EU homelessness strategy to encompass more than just monitoring and reporting and to develop measures which allow support for the development and maintenance of effective national and regional homelessness strategies.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Joining in with my fellow Members’ oral question, I would like to ask the Commission to focus mainly on prevention when drafting, as soon as possible, the EU’s homelessness strategy. Homelessness is reaching increasingly disconcerting levels in all of Europe today and, as a phenomenon, can be attributed, besides the obvious economic reasons, to a more and more atomised society and the dissolution of traditional small communities. Nowadays, the problem is no longer exclusive to those who have fallen to the fringes of society through alcohol or drug abuse: in a number of EU Member States, the phenomenon is affecting an increasingly large segment of the middle classes, including many people who hold college degrees and even have, or used to have, permanent jobs. It is these people who could avoid homelessness and the desolation it entails with relatively little targeted help provided according to a detailed strategy. We must sadly note that the kind of ‘private social safety net’ that had been typical of small communities showing solidarity for their members some decades ago either no longer exists or has been largely abandoned. This is another reason why Member States should pay more attention to the marginalised.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a comprehensive approach to non-CO2 climate-relevant anthropogenic emissions by Jo Leinen, Richard Seeber and Theodoros Skylakakis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (O-000135/2011 – B7-0418/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-737-000" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Skylakakis in particular. I worked with him to launch this initiative because I believe that we need to make use of all the opportunities available to us in the struggle against climate change. I know that Ms Hedegaard is prepared to fight for this cause and that she will put in place the necessary initiatives which we are calling for in this resolution. We want to give her our support in this area, so that these initiatives can be made into reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we all know, the Montreal Protocol was the first successful international treaty. It was signed in 1987 and more than 196 countries are now parties to it. It has made a major contribution to reducing emissions of ozone-depleting substances. At the same time, it has had the side effect of restricting the volume of substances that have an impact on climate change, such as hydrofluorocarbons, and at a much lower cost than preventing CO2 emissions. Therefore, I believe that we should focus on this battle, for economic and social reasons, because it is much easier to win in financial terms than reducing CO2, which involves our economy incurring costs in many areas. This is where we should start, because we know that we can be highly successful at a very low cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second area is, of course, the reduction of soot. We know that aerosol soot contributes to global warming and, in particular, when it forms deposits on areas of snow and ice, it causes them to melt more quickly. It is produced as a result of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. We can prevent this phenomenon by means of regulations within Europe at a relatively low cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final area is tropospheric ozone, which has a major impact on our climate. Its precursor substances are produced largely by cars. Here we need to strengthen the regulations which have been established in the air quality directives and other related directives and improve their implementation in order to prevent this climate-change gas from being produced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask Ms Hedegaard to continue her fight in this area. You have a great deal of support in Parliament. I would like once again to remind everyone that we must remain united in our battle against climate change. However, we need to work together to choose the most beneficial approach.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for being here today. May I, too, thank Richard Seeber for his very important assistance in helping us to push this issue forward. We all know that a large part of climate change is caused by gases other than carbon dioxide. However, our climate policy focuses – and that may have been sensible initially – almost exclusively on carbon dioxide. That comes at a very high environmental and financial cost to the man in the street.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is absurd – and hard to believe – that we still do not have an integrated policy for controlling these emissions, either at European or at international level. Just one category of non-CO2 emissions, namely hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), is forecast to account for 20% of global emissions by 2050. We know that from these HFCs, from just one category, namely HFC-23, we shall be able – thanks to the initiative by Parliament and by Commissioner Connie Hedegaard, who deserves our praise for this – to save approximately EUR 1 billion a year from 2013, which we have been giving to Chinese and Indian manufacturers for no good reason whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="el">The strategy we are proposing today will function alongside the strategy we have adopted on CO2 and energy efficiency and will help European businesses to remain competitive. I address these remarks specifically to my fellow Members who feel that we are trying to introduce another climate policy. On the contrary, we are doing something which, in the present crisis, will benefit businesses financially. We can start this policy at European and at international level within two to three years and we shall have tangible results within five to ten years; we shall have results quickly and with spectacularly low costs because, as we discovered with HFC-23 – and this applies to numerous other categories – we are not talking about 12 or 15 or 20 or 40 dollars a tonne; we are talking about 12 or 15 or 20 or 40 cents a tonne.</p>
      <p sl="el">Many have said that we need expensive coal. I personally would say that, in the present crisis, we need cheap coal, if we can obtain it on the market by taking such initiatives. I am sure that the Commissioner and the Commission will take such initiatives. I hope and expect as much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to give particular thanks to Mr Seeber and Mr Skylakakis for this opportunity to explain the Commission’s approach regarding man-made, non-CO2 climate-relevant emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are quite right; non-CO2 gases are a significant contributor to climate change. If we wish to cut our greenhouse gas emissions substantially, we must address emissions from non-CO2 gases in an effective way. I fully agree with your motion for a resolution on this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent road map for moving to a low carbon economy by 2050 explores cost-efficient pathways for key economic sectors in order to meet the 2050 EU objectives for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. This analysis clearly shows that the EU should reduce agricultural non-CO2 emissions by 42-49% and other non-CO2 emissions by 70-78% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Both gentlemen spoke about what is economically beneficial, and here these non-CO2 gases come very much into the picture.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the EU has already taken a number of measures to reduce such emissions. The Effort Sharing Decision covers CO2 as well as the five non-CO2 gases included in the Kyoto Protocol. The annual binding greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States will deliver a 10% reduction of emissions from the covered sectors in 2020 compared with 2005 levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We already address HFC emissions through the regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases and the directive on fluorinated emissions from mobile air-conditioning. The Commission will adopt a report reviewing the regulation in the coming weeks, which will show that the regulation has already contributed to the EU commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, if properly applied, the regulation on certain fluorinated gases (‘F-gases’) could, together with the directive on mobile air-conditioning, prevent almost half of the projected fluorinated gas emissions by 2050. Even more importantly, the report shows that there are options which could contribute to further cost-effective reductions. Therefore, I intend to put forward a legislative proposal in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to domestic action, internationally, the Commission has repeatedly called for global action to address the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). At the meetings of the parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Commission, as the negotiator for the European Union, supports the North American and Micronesian proposals to phase down global production and consumption of HFCs as a complement to mitigation action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also fully aware of the short-term climate implications of black carbon and tropospheric ozone, particularly – as I think Mr Seeber mentioned – in the Arctic area and in the Alpine regions. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has played a key role in several recent science assessments, in particular, in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2011 Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the EU, the Commission is preparing a review of the thematic strategy on air pollution. The review will be concluded in 2013 and will address air quality matters and their interlinkages with climate change policy. Black carbon and tropospheric ozone issues will be considered as part of that review.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in an international context, the EU is addressing pollutants like black carbon and tropospheric ozone under the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. Together with other European and North American countries, we are presently negotiating binding emission targets for ozone-creating pollutants. If a successful agreement can be struck by the end of this year – and I understand from my colleague, Commissioner Potočnik, who is responsible for these negotiations, that this outcome is within reach and there is a very good chance of achieving it – some improvements can be expected by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I know that UNEP will publish a report very soon setting out possible measures to reduce levels of black carbon in an effort to push for an international action plan for which international backing can be secured at Rio+20 in Brazil next June. Needless to say, Europe will push very hard for that to materialise.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, politics is about looking to the future. I therefore applaud the outstanding work done by my colleagues, Mr Seeber and Mr Skylakakis, who have actually visualised future environmental projects and environmental standards in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Seeber says, we need to seize every opportunity to help protect our planet. I totally agree with that point. In adopting this text, this resolution, we are preparing to implement and anticipate measures to combat global warming.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, and as Mr Skylakakis said, we all agree that we have to wait, given that the economic situation is such that we must delay the implementation of any new legislation that we might impose on our businesses. We all agree that economic operators are suffering today and that it is vital that we do not impose major environmental standards on our businesses again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said: ‘We do not inherit land from our parents; we borrow it from our children’. We need to act along those lines by giving our children back a clean planet. However, we must not give them back a planet that is not prosperous and that offers them no guarantees of a job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to conclude by saying that anthropogenic gases are man-made gases, with one example being the gases emitted by air-conditioning equipment. In this Chamber, it is always very cool, or even cold. I believe that if we, as a European institution, were to save a bit of energy by turning down our air-conditioning system, we would already be helping to pollute our planet less, without imposing restrictions on our businesses.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the changes in the climate which we are all experiencing have ecological and social repercussions that ultimately affect human health not only through changes to the quality and quantity of water, air and food, but also through changing weather and agricultural patterns and ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It has been proven scientifically that the benefits from cutting non-CO2 anthropogenic emissions are felt immediately and directly in the areas where measures are taken. I am pleased that we have managed to pass the point where carbon dioxide emissions were to blame for all the troubles with the Earth’s atmosphere and that the time has finally come for us to take action as well against other factors which are just as harmful as carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Let me give you just one example. It is currently estimated that the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) has an overall impact on global warming of around 2% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is expected that increased demand for HFCs could result in a contribution of 7-13% of the total greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Therefore, if we want to grasp the nettle, industry would quickly need a solid legal framework for encouraging producers to develop alternatives to HFCs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As I have said, this is just one example of many possible actions aimed at cutting anthropogenic emissions. I wanted the Commission to give a firm, concrete answer to the question submitted on this subject, which will allow measures to be taken within a relatively short period of time. In addition, as the Montreal Protocol has successfully highlighted that greenhouse gas emissions can be successfully reduced, I think that it provides the most suitable forum for regulating and reducing globally the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I want to tell a story to the Commissioner and the House. Back in 2004, the Commission put forward legislation, which I think was called the ‘F Gas Regulation’, part of which called for the phasing-out of the existing requirements as regards the gases used in mobile air conditioning – i.e. air conditioning systems in cars.</p>
      <p sl="de">I remember arguing that I did not have an air conditioning system in my car, but my Greek colleagues assured me that these things were essential, so I lost the argument. I said at the time that we should just open the window, but now I have succumbed myself and got an air-conditioned car. However, at the time, and indeed now, almost every car in use in Europe used or uses in its air conditioning system a hydrofluorocarbon called HFC-134a, which has a global warming potential 1 400 times greater than carbon dioxide. So if any leaks out, even in small quantities, it is an important contributor to the problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Eventually, after years of argument, we eventually resolved that from 2011, all new models of car should be fitted with an air conditioning system which used a gas with a global warming potential no greater than 150 times CO2. This led to a confused situation in the industry and there have been all sorts of rows over the years, but eventually, Honeywell and Dupont, two of the biggest chemical manufacturers, came up with an alternative air conditioning system using HFO-1234yf, which has a global warming potential of just four. This is going to become the standard: from 1 400 times CO2 to just four times CO2.</p>
      <p sl="de">The message of this story is very simple. Regulations, much derided though they may be by businessmen, can push forward the pace of innovation, and the Commissioner should be aware that, even though her staff may say there is no alternative to what we do at the moment, if she pushes the boat out, it is amazing what industry can achieve.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to Mr Seeber and Mr Skylakakis, who moved the question.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We know that fast-acting, climate-warming emissions should start to be reduced in number by 2015. For there to be any chance of that, we need to act swiftly with regard to non-CO2, climate-warming gases. Some fellow Members have already said that emissions from these gases can often be reduced far more cheaply than those of carbon dioxide, and even a hundred times more cheaply when compared to their effect on climate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Davis mentioned that the global warming effect of fluorinated greenhouse gases is up to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide. We know that their contribution to climate-warming gases is growing, so there is an urgent need for restrictions to be placed on them. These restrictions can be imposed via the Montreal Protocol, but the EU is the world’s largest market, and it could also act on its own decisions. It could show the way and take its own decisions to put a stop to the use of these gases.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have already heard examples of the better and more climate-friendly options that already exist for many purposes, and researchers and engineers are developing more of them all the time. If we can provide a model by our own example, it will be easier to assure other countries of the necessity for the same measures and, at the same time, develop our own leading position in the world of technology.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One study suggests that between 5% and 20% of the F-gases used in refrigeration equipment in shops leak over the course of a year. This is a very substantial figure, and we really need to take urgent action to show the world the way through our own actions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Seeber and Mr Skylakakis, as well as Ms Hedegaard. I believe that we are here today, debating and arguing, to really try and achieve a strong European climate policy that is capable of safeguarding the economic development and well-being of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">As has been noted, international climate polices have mainly focused on reducing CO2 emissions. However, as this proposal highlights, it is important that we also face up to other anthropogenic emissions, which lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone and affect climate change.</p>
      <p sl="it">A great many points have already been raised and I think we really ought to be aware of a few things: we can do this today with absolutely reasonable costs and we have the technologies available. In addition, as much as it is certain that CO2 emissions have the biggest effect, and as much as it is certain that other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere account for much lower percentages, it is equally certain that their potential is very high and that therefore, in just a few years, or a few half-dozen years, we could actually achieve significant and very important results.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is evidence – including in the United States, as Ms Hedegaard noted – and I have seen a study published in Nature by the Scientific Agency of the US Department of Commerce which has many similarities with the analysis that my fellow Members have carried out. I therefore imagine that these very things will allow Europe to show up in Durban with an even stronger, more tangible and important stance on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">Given the extraordinarily difficult and sensitive times we are going through – indeed, we were talking about the homeless until a few minutes ago – European citizens are rather on edge. Therefore, bearing in mind that this huge sensitivity obviously relates mostly to jobs, we must be capable of putting together a communications campaign that properly explains to citizens what it is that we actually want to do for development, their well-being and to protect jobs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, according to the latest Commission forecasts, the European Union is doing better than expected at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It is largely due to this reduction in CO2 emissions that by implementing the climate and energy package adopted in 2006, the European Union will be able to reduce its emissions by up to 25% by 2020. Still, as noted very accurately by this proposal, this draft resolution, it is important to also focus on non-CO2 greenhouse gases. On a point of criticism, the rapporteurs interpreted the term ‘anthropogenic’ in a narrow sense. After all, crop growing and livestock farming are also the results of human activity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Indeed, methane has twenty-five times the greenhouse potential of carbon dioxide, while nitrogen oxide almost three hundred times. As I said, crop production is also a result of human activity. In crop production, a cutback in the use of fertilisers, and a more targeted use in terms of time and space, could make a substantial contribution towards the reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions. The same applies to livestock farming, where methane should be reduced, and that is why biogas is extremely important. I was rapporteur for this topic in 2008 and I consider it a very important step that the first pillar of the new common agricultural policy, direct payments, will include a greening component from 2014, and that the methane and nitrogen oxide emissions of agriculture can thereby be reduced.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that the European Parliament is adopting a more comprehensive position on climate policy, both generally and with this statement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When speaking of climate change, our attention often focuses too much merely on cutting carbon dioxide emissions, instead of the far broader picture that deserves our consideration. Europe and the other continents must also try to cut other greenhouse gas emissions in addition to carbon dioxide emissions. We have a history of excellent examples of successful climate agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol, which have resulted in the prevention of extensive ozone depletion and, at the same time, a significant reduction in greenhouse gases too.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Restrictions on the use of harmful coolants have been very effective, but there is also still a lot to do in Europe. For example, the more ozone-friendly HFC coolant is not climate-friendly. Furthermore, the demand for refrigeration equipment and cold appliances will also continue to grow quite considerably in the future, because economic growth and the rise in living standards in China and India will also have an effect on the need for refrigeration. More and more people are buying refrigerators and air conditioners, and that is why we in Europe also need to invest more in developing climate-friendly cold appliances.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We should remember that the demands of energy efficiency, and, where it concerns refrigerators, food safety, need to be abided by strictly. The food cold chain must operate in such a way that consumers can be guaranteed a supply of safe food in the future. I hope that the Commission will also take these aspects of the issue into account when it reforms these regulations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Seeber and Mr Skylakakis, for putting this question, and also to thank the Commissioner for replying.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to point out to my colleague, Mrs Auconie, that, though we keep stressing the need for changes to benefit the economy, we should be clear that, as Achim Steiner said today in Mexico, by tackling black carbon, we are not only addressing climate change but also improving our air quality. If you look at the health co-benefits, we are talking about the possibility of saving billions of euro by reducing our black carbon emissions, so it is not only environmentally but also economically a very clever thing to do. We really should bear that in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a question for the Commissioner as regards black carbon, which was specifically mentioned by Achim Steiner, because while we say it is very important, we know that in Europe, around 50% of black carbon emissions come from domestic combustion. What kind of measures are you thinking of taking to address that? Also, 20% of black carbon emissions come from non-road machinery, and we know that this year, the Commission – albeit not your DG, Commissioner – proposed lower emission limits and greater flexibility in that area. So can we expect more surprises when it comes to black carbon?</p>
      <p sl="en">We know aviation will be covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme in the coming year, but does the Commission have any specific plans concerning the issue of the formation of contrails and cirrus? We know that these can have a huge different impact on climate change as well, especially along aircraft flight paths, and the issue could be addressed in cooperation with meteorological institutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, what can we expect on NOx emissions by the aviation sector, because action was promised in 2008, and we are still anxiously waiting for a proposal from the Commission?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, promoting a green, competitive economy which is efficient in terms of using resources is a key element in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The actions taken by the European Union in the last few decades have resulted in a significant reduction in the emissions of atmospheric pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulate matter. The directives on the quality of the fuels used in both road and maritime transport have made a vitally important contribution to this reduction. Council Directive 1999/32/EC relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels stipulates the maximum permitted sulphur content for heavy fuel oil, diesel and ship engines used in the Union. Measures promoting energy efficiency in buildings and the recycling of waste will also help considerably in cutting polluting emissions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, I would like to ask what measures you are intending to take to ensure the reduction in polluting emissions caused by industrial sectors, especially against the background of the economic and financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, the European Commission’s draft regulation banning the use of carbon credits for projects involving industrial greenhouse gases, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, in the EU emissions trading scheme after April 2013 was officially approved in May 2011. However, this ban does not cover the national targets of the Member States of the European Union for sectors which are not included in the trading scheme, such as agriculture and transport. This is important, given that, according to the effort sharing decision, up to 2/3 of total emission reductions required of the Member States could be covered by using carbon credits.</p>
      <p sl="el">Environmental organisations are asking the European Union to extend the ban on the use of carbon credits to sectors not covered by the trading scheme. We are worried that, without a clear commitment, some Member States will be able to keep using carbon credits to achieve national targets, at a time when businesses are already prohibited from using them to achieve their emission reduction targets. My question therefore is this: should the Commission not examine such a ban?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we have a paradox nowadays between the need to control polluting emissions and the tendency to increase consumption at a time of globalisation. We are looking on helplessly at the disastrous impact of climate change, but hesitate at going ahead and adopting more concrete measures. The reservations featuring in the Copenhagen and Cancun agreements are conclusive. We remain ever hopeful that future conferences will adopt a firm stance on this point.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe provides an example of an initiative for combating climate change. I think that the Commission’s role at the moment is to initiate a specific strategy for gradually reducing the production and consumption of polluting substances. The framework programmes for research and innovation could help identify alternative solutions for gradually replacing current technologies with innovative, non-polluting technologies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am a chemical engineer. Chemistry helps us a great deal nowadays in our daily life, but it can also kill us. We need to use good judgment to go beyond making wonderful declarations of intent and urgently proceed with taking concrete measures.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, as we have seen in this debate, there are various man-made atmospheric emissions that could affect the Earth’s climate. However, as we know, the European Union’s approach to climate change has been to focus almost exclusively on carbon dioxide. This cannot be unrelated to the fact that it is the compound chosen to construct a scheme to create billions in fantasy financial assets through so-called carbon trading. However, where these so-called market solutions – which have also been applied to other compounds, in theory and in practice – have already been tested, I would say that they have not proven to be effective but rather, on the contrary, they have proven to be ineffective and perverse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order to limit emissions of gases capable of affecting the Earth’s atmosphere, there is therefore a need for a regulatory approach, as an alternative to so-called market solutions: an approach that takes account of the possibilities opened up by scientific and technical knowledge, and developments in scientific and technical knowledge, the specific situation of each country and a necessary and profound change to the current most dominant mode of production at global level.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the European Union does much for the gradual improvement of the climate. It is a leader within the global community when it comes to proposing and promoting effective measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Actual knowledge shows, however, that saving the climate will require a more complex approach to anthropogenic emissions. It turns out that, as stated in the submitted question, we should gradually begin to limit the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, reduce coal emissions and reduce the production of gases contributing to the creation of tropospheric ozone. In the increased effort for an immediate reduction in the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons at the international level, we can already rely on the provisions of the Montreal Protocol. Experience from the current behaviour of the global community shows us, however, that even more measures for climate improvement will have to be drawn up and initiated, and perhaps here in Europe. The sooner we make a start with this, the sooner will the other countries of the world be able to join our efforts at climate improvement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I can see that he is not here any more but concerning the first intervention by Mr Tănăsescu, I just wanted to clarify one thing. I think that most people here will be aware of it, but although it does sound as if we are always only addressing CO2 emissions, this is actually not true. The vocabulary we use for simplicity’s sake always refers to CO2 emission reductions. This is because everything in the international negotiations is measured in CO2 equivalents, but that, of course, means that other kinds of emissions are being translated, so to speak, into the currency of CO2. Sometimes therefore, this might give the wrong picture as if we are only talking about or only addressing CO2 emissions. That is not the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Chris Davies’s story about air conditioning in cars, I know that Mr Davies will be aware that I agree 100% with the view that we heard, that when you make a regulation, it actually pushes innovation forward. The story we heard started back in 2004 when we drew up the F-Gas regulation. I recall that very well because that Environment Council meeting was my first Council meeting as Danish Minister, and we had this big fight about how ambitious the F-Gas regulation should be. I still recall that a few of us – I think Austria and Denmark – fought so that we could have more ambitious targets in our respective Member States, so I can assure the whole Parliament that I have given a very clear message to all my services that the review we are going to make must be as ambitious as it can sensibly be. I look forward very much to working with Parliament in securing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could ask a lot of detailed questions, saying what about this or that, but I think I addressed most of them in my first intervention. One key initiative to try to address many of these things will be the review that I mentioned for the thematic strategy on air pollution: the review will be ready for 2013. That is a major initiative and I think we will have a chance there to address many of these things.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Tremopoulos mentioned that it is fine that we have imposed a ban on HFC-23 for companies, but what about Member States? I can tell you that back in March at the Environment Council, the Danish Minister proposed that the Member States commit voluntarily not to use HFC-23 and, by the next Council meeting in June, this alliance had grown quite substantially. I cannot exactly recall here, but there were maybe 10-12 countries or more who said they would check and come back, so I think there is a growing movement among Member States to follow our legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I can also say that, since last week, when I had the chance to discuss this in New Zealand, in Australia and elsewhere, it is my feeling that when we do things like this with HFC-23 in Europe, others consider how they can follow. It is not that we do it in an empty room and then nothing more happens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would very much like to thank you for the draft resolution and I will be looking forward also to working with the European Parliament when we come with this review and the suggestions as to how to follow up on the F-Gas regulation. That is one thing we can do relatively soon internally in Europe. At the same time, as I mentioned, there are a number of international initiatives where we could try to mutually support one another and try to push forward this agenda at international level too. So thank you very much for this initiative. I am looking forward to continued cooperation on this.</p>
