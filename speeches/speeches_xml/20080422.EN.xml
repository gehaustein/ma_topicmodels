      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Jean-Pierre Audy on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the European Investment Bank’s annual report for 2006 (2007/2251(INI)) (A6-0079/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-008" speaker_id="33775" name="Jean-Pierre Audy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, President of the European Investment Bank, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to thank you, Mr Maystadt, for the excellent relationship you have built up with the MEPs on the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has made a significant contribution to enabling the report we are about to debate to be written. I would extend these thanks to your team of staff, and especially, Philippe de Fontaine Vive, Vice-President, with whom I was able to work in complete transparency at the Bank’s headquarters in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You carry out your role, Mr Maystadt, with a great deal of competence, warmth, determination and courage, but also with wisdom and, I would add, with elegance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EIB, which was set up by the Treaty of Rome, celebrates its fiftieth anniversary in 2008. Its members are the European Union Member States, and their finance ministers form its board of governors. Its mission is to contribute to the development of the common market, using the capital markets and its own funds. It is a Community instrument, but within it power is exercised intergovernmentally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a good thing that citizens’ representatives are talking about these issues at a time when citizens themselves are demanding results from the European Union; they often benefit from the EIB’s services without realising it. First I would like to congratulate the Bank for its action, its ambitious plan of activities and projects; I particularly welcome the excellence of the new strategy for 2007–2009 including transparency, the reinforcement of added value and the gradual increase in risk-taking, activities for the benefit of SMEs and local government, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the European Commission. The important role of the Bank in the neighbourhood policy should also be underlined, and the report calls more specifically for further development of the facility for Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership, or FEMIP, within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe, however, that the time has come to go even further, faster and better, in terms of both control and support for the European Union in financing its investments. In terms of control mechanisms, I think the time has come to set up genuine control of banking regulation, and I suggest that the EIB itself apply to the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, based in London, to look at the conditions for this task of regulation and in particular decide who could carry it out in the regrettable absence of an official European banking regulator.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning support for the European Union in financing investment, where needs have been estimated at EUR 600 billion for the trans-European transport networks alone, I suggest that a reflection be carried out on the role of the European Union in terms of the development of our territory. The funding allocated by the Member States and the EU is far from able to meet these needs. Is it not understandable, Commissioner, that the European Union should have difficulty finding EUR 3.4 billion to finance as strategic a project from an industrial, scientific and military point of view as Galileo, under these circumstances?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I suggest that, given the quality of the EIB’s human resources, its detachment and its experience of financing major infrastructure, the Commission gives it the task of carrying out a strategic study on the funding of investments, excluding no possible scenarios: subsidies, payment of sums subscribed by the Member States to the EIB’s capital, loans (including special loans from the Member States as provided for in Article 6 of the EIB’s Statute), innovative instruments such as risk sharing, loan guarantee instruments, financial engineering appropriate to long-term projects that are not immediately profitable according to market-based financial criteria, creation of an investment section within the European Union budget, financial consortia between European, national and local authorities, public-private partnerships, etc.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These, Mr President, Mr Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, are the ideas put forward in this report. I look forward to hearing the debate that will follow and thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="2-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Audy, who has produced and just presented to us an excellent report on the annual report of the European Investment Bank for 2006. I think that, as the report reflects, the productive dialogue established between the European Investment Bank and Parliament in recent years is very important, as it benefits democratic transparency, which is very important to both Parliament and to the financial institution.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EIB contributes significantly to launching and developing many European policies, and we should therefore welcome the quality of this dialogue, which is undoubtedly being strengthened with Philippe Maystadt at the bank’s helm.</p>
      <p sl="es">The activity of the European Investment Bank is also being strengthened through the new financial framework, with the new financial perspectives for the European Union for the 2007-2013 period. Obviously we are debating the 2006 report. The progress of these perspectives in this initial period of 15 or 16 months is not yet covered by the report, but with the new funding instruments launched thanks to these new perspectives, this cooperation will continue to take place and to become more ambitious and effective in many fields: in policies on research and development, regional development, trans-European networks, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also, with regard to the external actions of the European Investment Bank, on the basis of these financial perspectives the new EIB external mandate has already been adopted. It is not only in the Bank itself, but within the European Investment Bank group that cooperation is also being increased, with the European Investment Fund. Proof of this, for example, is the Jeremy programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, we are satisfied with the tripartite agreement between the European Investment Bank, the EBRD, which is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Commission, for actions by each of them in countries bordering the European Union to the east, and also with the development of the new FEMIP, which Mr Audy referred to, which is doing a great deal of work, and these are examples of an increasingly close link between the activities of the Bank and the external activities of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Audy’s report highlights, and in my view rightly so, the potential of the European Investment Bank for developing innovative funding instruments that are capable of having an enormous effect in terms of increasing the resources available in the European budget for implementing a whole series of policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission is aware of this potential. Not only have we already made some agreements with the European Investment Bank, which have been approved by the Council and Parliament, to do more with the same budgetary resources in areas such as trans-European networks or research and development policy, but also, in the context of the review of the Community budget that we will propose at the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009 for debate, we are looking at extending these new funding mechanisms, and the resulting increase in capacity for action through the budgetary resources available, to other priority areas such as energy and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the mechanisms for cooperation with the Bank, I would also like to inform you that we are already finalising the negotiations with the Bank on a new memorandum of understanding to cover all of our cooperation relations, and we hope that it will enable these relations to be even more effective.</p>
      <p sl="es">I cannot give a response to the suggestion from the rapporteur, Mr Audy, whose concern I share, regarding what the right solution is for the European Investment Bank to be supervised as a financial institution. I do not have the solution, but I think this is a very pertinent question, on which we should all cooperate in order to provide a suitable response.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President, I would like to reiterate the Commission’s satisfaction with this high level of cooperation between Parliament and the European Investment Bank, and I hope that in the future this will enable all of us – all the European institutions – to contribute to better achieving the Union’s objectives.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The report is an example of good cooperation between the European Parliament and this financial institution which has the task to contribute for a balanced and sound development of the Community by using capital market tools and its own resources. I congratulate the rapporteur on his good presentation of the European Investment Bank, his reasonable suggestions aimed at enhancing cooperation, efficiency and transparency of operations. The Bank’s report lists ample examples of achievement in terms of the main goals and priorities of the Union such as the geographic allocation of investments, strategic direction and project applications. Future efforts should focus on several areas such as to encourage private business to implement investment policies, including social responsibility projects in line with the EU social cohesion and territorial balance policy; to identify internal audit and internal control mechanisms; to set up offices in the new Member States; and to establish new financing mechanisms. I support the amendments made in plenary which deal with more stringent control over capital.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has made a number of recommendations and I agree with three of them. I would also like to ask Mr Maystadt to respond to this in his reply.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are happy that the European Investment Bank operates a zero tolerance policy with regard to fraud and corruption. The European Parliament would actually like to further reinforce that policy. We recommend measures, for example, for implementing an exclusion mechanism with regard to companies that are suspected or have been found guilty of corruption. We support a reinforcement of the policy on whistleblowers and we are in favour of a revision of the existing tendering procedures. What does Mr Maystadt think of these?</p>
      <p sl="nl">A second element: many billions of euros are invested in trans-European networks. As the European Parliament, we should seek to support those projects in particular that have a smaller or negative CO2 footprint.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, with regard to external loan operations, we would like supervision to be exercised to ensure that such activities, particularly on the African continent, are in keeping with the European consensus with regard to development and also the millennium objectives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As President of the European Investment Bank, how does Mr Maystadt respond to Parliament’s recommendations?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012" speaker_id="24029" name="Koenraad Dillen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we applaud the fact that this report emphasises the EIB’s zero tolerance policy with regard to fraud and corruption and also highlights the increasing number of investigations being conducted by OLAF. However, experience in contracting loans has shown us that the EIB is not without sin. Recently, for instance, a loan of EUR 100 billion to a large-scale mining project in Congo came under heavy criticism owing to all kinds of major irregularities, such as a lack of transparency in the negotiation process and in the final award of the contract. There was a serious conflict of interest. Since 2000, the European Investment Bank has already invested more than EUR 700 million in all manner of mining projects in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I would like to stress here is that these many millions come from European taxpayers and that our institution’s loan and contract policy must therefore also be subject to the most thorough supervision possible, particularly when funding projects outside Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013" speaker_id="2278" name="Paul Rübig" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, President Maystadt, I would like to congratulate Mr Audy, because he made the point very well that trans-European networks have particular significance for us. I can imagine that, in this respect, the EIB also provides an incentive instrument for ownership unbundling.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now have the Commission’s proposals before us, that is, to increase the focus on ownership unbundling in the energy and telecommunications sector. My suggestion would be to concentrate on creating incentives here rather than focusing on making statutory obligations.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that the export industry is currently having difficulty in maintaining its performance, especially now the euro is strong. Would it not be possible to focus on special programmes to provide guaranteed support for the export performance of our European businesses?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-014" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Philippe Maystadt" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Investment Bank">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank you for giving me the chance once again to continue our dialogue with the European Parliament. I think it is important that an institution like the EIB should regularly have to explain itself to the representatives of EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would particularly like to thank Mr Audy for his report. I can bear witness to the fact that he has put a great deal of personal effort into writing this report. He took part in many working meetings both in Brussels and Luxembourg, thereby taking up the constructive dialogue we began with his predecessors. In his presentation this morning, he highlighted two points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first issue is one we have already talked about in previous reports – I remember Mr Schmidt’s report and Mr Lipietz’s report – and it is the issue of whether the European Investment Bank, because it is a bank, should be subject to banking control or supervision. This is not provided for as the texts currently stand. There are, of course, audits of the European Investment Bank: the audit by the Court of Auditors, to the extent that the EIB uses EU funds, and also the audit by the audit committee, composed of experts appointed by the governors, who report directly to our governors. It is true, however, that, if we want to apply the best banking practices to the EIB, it would undoubtedly be desirable for a specialist body to check that these practices are correctly applied to the EIB.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Theoretically, we can think of three possible avenues. The first is written into the Treaty of Maastricht, in Article 105(6). This would be the possibility of the European Central Bank exercising this supervisory role. The Treaty states that the Council, acting unanimously, may confer a prudential supervision role on the European Central Bank. This is an avenue that exists theoretically but realistically it is doubtful whether the Member States, at the moment at least, would be unanimous in conferring this new role on the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another possibility is the one we have embarked on informally, namely calling on a national regulator. At the moment it is the Luxembourg regulator, the Supervisory Council of the Luxembourg financial sector, which also performs this role in relation to the European Investment Bank, particularly when it comes to checking Basel II is being applied correctly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A third avenue for exploration would be to strengthen the audit committee provided for in our Statute, and to convert it into a quasi-banking supervisor. The Reform Treaty provides for the enlargement of the audit committee. A first step might be to appoint a number of banking supervisors, who would bring to the audit committee the necessary experience to check that the EIB is actually applying best practices in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point highlighted by Mr Audy was the special role he would like to see the European Investment Bank play in infrastructure, particularly the trans-European networks. As you know, the EIB already plays a relatively important role in this. Last year, we financed the trans-European networks to the tune of nearly EUR 9 billion. We use various instruments, including our structured finance facility, which allows us to take more risks than is generally the rule. For example, we recently did this for a motorway in Greece. This is a good concrete example of the use of this particular facility to encourage the private sector to take more risks with the operation of a motorway.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With the European Commission very recently, we developed a new guarantee mechanism to cover a particular type of risk, the risk of insufficient traffic during the first few years of operation of an item of infrastructure. Experience has shown that the first four or five years are often the trickiest. These are the years when income is not necessarily at the level hoped for. This causes problems for private operators, so to encourage the private sector to take on the financing of such infrastructure regardless of this problem, in conjunction with the Commission we have developed a new guarantee mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that the European Investment Bank has taken the initiative of setting up a European expertise centre in public-private partnerships to share our experience in this area with national representatives. Mr Audy, this is certainly an area in which the EIB is eager to continue its action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Staes asked a question about the anti-fraud policy. We have just published our anti-fraud policy following a consultation procedure that required several rounds of talks. In relation to the specific question he raised, about a debarment system that would prohibit companies guilty of fraud or corruption from continuing to participate in projects we were financing, we announce in this policy that we hope to be able to use the same system that the Commission is attempting to set up. If we could not – and we should know this by the end of the year – if, for legal reasons, we could not use the same system, then we would set up our own debarment system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards our financing in the energy sector, we have reviewed our policy on financing energy projects in the light of European guidelines on combating climate change. As a result, we have decided to give priority to investments of the type that will reduce CO2 emissions, and this already shows up in the figures for 2007, since finance for electricity generation products using fossil fuels accounts for only 25% of our financing in the energy sector. In 2007, the amount committed to renewable energies, for example, far exceeds the amount committed to these more traditional forms of energy generation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as regards the millennium development goals, we are obviously trying, as far as possible, to make sure our projects contribute to their achievement. However, I would draw your attention to the fact that when we intervene outside the European Union, we are acting on the basis of specific mandates given to us by the European Council. The millennium development goals do not feature as such in the mandates we have received from the European Council. That is why it is not possible to make as direct a link as you would have liked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, to Mr Dillen who, if I understood correctly, mentioned a project he said we financed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I can say that for several years now we have not provided any more finance in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our board of directors has in principle approved finance for a mining project in Katanga, but nothing has yet been paid out for this project. The loan agreement has not yet been signed. Why is this? It is because the new Congolese Government quite rightly wanted to renegotiate the licence conditions to ensure more of the revenue went back to the Congolese state, and we suspended the signing of the contract until a satisfactory agreement had been reached between the promoter and the Congolese Government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, those are a few answers I can give to those who spoke, and I would like to thank Parliament once again, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control for our excellent collaboration.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much, President Maystadt. We are very grateful to you for your presence here this morning, for your report and especially for the work you do for the European Union as President of the European Investment Bank. Thank you again and all the best!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would in turn like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Almunia, and the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt, for these specific answers. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs from the political groups, who supported the writing of this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to share a few thoughts on the debate we have just had, firstly on the task of regulation. I believe it is in everyone’s interest that banking regulation of this kind should be set up. Obviously I do not have the solution. The idea that it is the European Central Bank that should do it seems to me a good one. For the Luxembourg regulatory body to play a stronger independent role, a genuine regulatory role, could also be a short-term solution. Nevertheless, I believe Parliament will be very interested in the opinion of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors if the Bank applies to it as the report suggests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, regarding the financing of infrastructure, I would like to say that the European Union is clearly at a cross-roads and that financing is not enough now, but that debt should obviously not be used to fund operation, which is sadly what is happening in some Member States. Debt used skilfully for investment is, however, a key part of economic and social performance in Europe, which is competing with all the other economic regions of the world. I believe the time has come for a major development policy for the land, partially supported by investment. There needs to be public investment, because if there is not, we cannot expect there to be private investment. It is a problem of collective confidence in the future of the European Union and I am delighted that the European Investment Bank can offer its expertise thanks to its experience and the quality of its human resources.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President Maystadt, Mr Audy, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur most warmly and congratulate him on the good, balanced work he has carried out. I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan. When it comes to energy and innovation, the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy. Without the EIB we would not have got the CIP off to such a good start.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EIB’s strategy for 2007-2009 provides for reinforcement of the value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission. I heartily endorse this strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The evaluation of the activity by the EIB rapporteur and the suggested next steps are correct. However, we must not forget that the role of Parliament is limited. Although the EIB is one of the Community’s institutions, its power is exercised internally according to intergovernmental rules, which means that the Member States are the most influential shareholders. The European Parliament has been commenting on the EIB’s activity reports regularly since 1999 and this has developed into a close, trusting, successful relationship of cooperation. I would particularly like to praise the cooperation with President Maystadt, which is exemplary for relationships with other institutions.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I must begin by reminding everyone that we are nearing the end of an incredibly important exercise. In general terms, if Parliament’s role is analysed in relation to that of the other institutions, it is perhaps possible to say that we have three main tasks. We are involved in creating legislation for the European countries and their citizens. We are involved in establishing the budget, i.e. determining what the EU’s funds should be used for. Finally, the last role is to act as a supervisory body. It is Parliament that is the citizens’ watchdog, if one can put it that way. The exercise that we will complete here today is possibly the most important part of this role of supervisory body: it is the part where we meticulously review the Commission and the other institutions in relation to how they manage the funds, and not least, of course, assess how things are working in the Member States, where we know that around 80% of the EU’s funds are managed.</p>
      <p sl="da">That said, it is also naturally down to me to praise my fellow Members from the other groups. It is Parliament as a whole that will vote on the report today. I believe we have enjoyed excellent cooperation within the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would particularly like to mention the shadow rapporteurs, who I believe have contributed very constructively to the matter. This is of course why we have been able to exert such enormous pressure on the Commission and enter into such constructive dialogue with it.</p>
      <p sl="da">Let me begin by mentioning a couple of positive points. I will certainly move on to the negative aspects, but let me begin by mentioning a couple of positive points in relation to previous years. There is no doubt that within the agricultural sector we have made good progress in connection with controlling the funds. The ‘integrated financial control system’ – and yes, this is probably not the view of many citizens out there in Europe who are following this speech – means of course that a completely new and much more effective way of controlling the EU’s agricultural funds has been introduced. The system is extremely effective. The European Court of Auditors itself has highlighted this many times. We already know that within a few years essentially all the funds within the agricultural policy will be covered by this very effective system, which definitely deserves praise. However, in recent years we have had heard strong criticism regarding a number of points connected with the research policy. In addition, it must be noted at this point that the Commission has taken our criticism very seriously and has implemented an action plan, which has ensured that many of these problems are in the process of being resolved. The Commission deserves a great deal of praise for this. Finally, we are naturally very pleased about the initiatives, which have been brought out into the open. We now have openness concerning the recipients of EU support in relation to both social funds and agricultural expenses. Additionally, we will now find out the names of the participants of the various working groups in the Council and the Commission, something that this House has fought for for many years. The Commission has now consented to disclose this information.</p>
      <p sl="da">It has to be said that this is a very positive development. However, it is of course clear that this process has concerned areas in which we have had a certain amount of criticism. Everyone who has been following the process knows that this specifically concerns two areas: the Structural Funds and foreign policy matters, i.e. external matters. With regard to the Structural Funds, the Court of Auditors concluded very clearly that 12% of the funds that had been paid out should never have been paid: 12%, or almost EUR 4 billion. It is obvious that this is a completely unacceptable situation.</p>
      <p sl="da">It was the starting point for the exercise that we will conclude today. We have had several consultations, and together with the committee I have personally enjoyed close dialogue with the Commission. The fact that as rapporteur I can now finish by granting discharge is solely due to the fact that we have achieved a number of results. The Commission has actually implemented a considerable number of reforms – it has been shown that 37 very specific points will now be implemented. This has been adopted by the College of Commissioners. In some areas, it is a question of introducing both more and tighter controls, while in other areas it is a question of simplifying the controls to make them more effective. In all areas, very clear deadlines have been introduced. We have been given some very clear criteria regarding how feedback should be given, so that both we and the public have the opportunity to check that this also actually has a positive effect. We must remember two things: firstly, of course, the fact that the money that was paid out incorrectly in 2006 – which is the subject of this procedure – is to be recovered. We believe that this has now been guaranteed. However, there must also be a guarantee that it will not happen again in future. This is probably just as important. With the new procedures that the Commission has put forward, we believe that this goal has been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is obvious that fine words alone are not enough. Although we have now said that we accept the reforms that have been put forward, we will follow up this matter and monitor process very carefully. Therefore, today I would also like to put forward an amendment proposal, which I understand that the Commission is prepared to support. I have received an indication from Mr Kallas that it may be an acceptable solution if the Commission were to meet with the Committee on Budgetary Control once a month and give us the opportunity to discuss the progress made in this area. This would be incredibly beneficial for both parties.</p>
      <p sl="da">Allow me to say a few words about the second area in which we have experienced major problems. This concerns matters of foreign policy. More specifically, it concerns the issue of Iraq. We know that the EU is providing some funding for the reconstruction of Iraq – there are certainly many good political reasons for doing so. We have singled out Iraq as an example. We would like a list of the specific projects in Iraq that are financed either in part or in full by the EU via the UN and the World Bank. Obtaining such a list has proved to be extremely difficult. It has taken several months. The information that we already knew should have been on the list was nevertheless not on the list, and there was a prolonged discussion back and forth until, quite recently, we finally obtained the information that we should have had in the first place. This is of course why we are now finally in a position where we can actually also give discharge in this area. The most important question in connection with this is naturally: what about the future? Iraq is simply one example. What about the other countries, of which there are more than 100, where the EU provides support for various activities? The Commission has now committed itself to granting public access to the final beneficiary, i.e. the final recipient of the support, from 2007 onwards, which is something that I acknowledge and believe is entirely necessary.</p>
      <p sl="da">For all these reasons, I recommend that we grant discharge. There are a number of criticisms that can be highlighted with regard to the Commission and with regard to the ways that things are done in the Member States. I would also like to say that we have achieved a result through good dialogue with the Commission. This means that we can now recommend that approval be granted for the accounts for 2006. There are still areas in which we would like to see things being taken further. We would very much like to have ‘national declarations of assurance’, as is the term here in Parliament, i.e. annual national auditing declarations, signed by the finance minister of the country in question. We still believe that this would be a very beneficial tool in the fight against deception, fraud and secrecy concerning EU funds in the individual countries. With this concluding wish, I would like to say thank you for the opportunity to speak in the first round.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, welcome to this debate, attended by the Secretary-General and of course welcome to Mr Kallas. I cannot welcome anyone from the Council, as it appears that it does not have anything to do with accounts and taking responsibility for the political debate on discharge. I hope that when the Council has a president, after the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be guaranteed that the Council will also be present at this debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would first like to congratulate my colleague Dan Jørgensen on his excellent report, and highlight from what he said how well things are being done in the European Union, and how they are being done better every year. He referred on several occasions to an initiative by Commissioner Kallas and the Commission on transparency. I was rapporteur two months ago for an own-initiative report supporting the transparency policy. Well, the Commission is indeed making progress on transparency policy, as Parliament has also done.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to point out that the role of Parliament in giving discharge is a political role, and that we are not and nor should we be accountants. It is a political role, and the question that we have to answer for citizens is: with the money that Parliament has, have we been able to meet the budgetary challenges for the 2006 financial year? Challenges such as Parliament preparing for enlargement, to receive new Member States, expanding the information policy, doing our work better, preparing ourselves for the challenge of Lisbon, in that we are going to have to legislate more and in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="es">What is the political verdict on what we have done with these financial commitments? It is a positive one. We have done well. I would like to highlight a few points from this financial year. Firstly, on the initiative of President Hans Pöttering, we have initiated a political dialogue between the Presidency and the procedure for discharge, which until now did not appear to be possible. Now it is possible, and your vice-president was present at the debate, facing up to the questions put to him live and direct by the committee. Also, on the initiative of the President, the Bureau is going to have a regular procedure of working with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, so I thank you.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many aspects of transparency in Parliament have improved, as you can see in the report. We have improved the presentation of the roles of our assistants. What has not been possible this year has been for us to finally create a statute for assistants, which we are asking for. The truth is that as MEPs it has taken us a long time to have our own statute. In short, we will have to ask for patience, but we must emphasise that we have not yet achieved this objective. In 2006, however, the reference year, 99% of papers were submitted in the right way, so I think that this issue is also moving in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have outstanding problems, and on these we are more or less trying to do what we can. Citizens do not understand why Parliament should have three locations, they do not understand it, and they are not going to understand it because it is not easy to understand. This is another challenge for when the Council has a president: finding a solution. Parliament has, however, done its duty and reduced the cost of the three locations from EUR 203 million in 2002 to EUR 155 million. We have cut the bill by 24%, which is good.</p>
      <p sl="es">What challenges are we going to tackle, as I mention in this report? As I have just said, giving our assistants a definitive statute, as we have ourselves. There is also the challenge of legislating better. Parliament is going to play a much greater qualitative role and have a much larger workload with the Lisbon Treaty when it comes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us hope that the Belgian Government, now that we have a Belgian Government, will treat us a little better in terms of buildings policy than it has up to now, as its treatment has been mediocre.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to finish by saying that we have had a prudent year in terms of our budgetary responsibilities, and this is why I am asking you to vote in favour of these accounts for 2006.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I have been the rapporteur for these other institutions as they have been called, seven of them, in other words the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I have had no serious objections to anything I have looked at. It has been a matter of normal comments on what can and should be improved. There have been no revelations which could in any way call into question granting of discharge to any of these seven institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that granting discharge, exacting responsibility, is fundamental to democracy. I have no faith in this chamber’s way of handling this task, as I had precisely the same job of examining these seven institutions two years ago and then, ladies and gentlemen, discovered the most appalling things going on in the Committee of the Regions. I found that fraud of the most serious nature had been committed there. I obtained material which you were all able to read in the secret reading room.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There were three separate investigations into this: one by OLAF, our Anti-Fraud Office, one by the Court of Auditors, and the Committee of the Regions itself also conducted an internal investigation. They had dismissed their internal auditors. The list of complaints was endless.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I therefore naturally proposed that we should not grant discharge in those circumstances. I said this in the committee. The committee still voted to discharge. I said the same thing here in Parliament two years ago, and you voted to discharge by a large majority.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This shows that when you should be voting to discharge here today on my recommendation, you are not doing so because I say so but purely out of habit. This assembly is not accepting its responsibility. It is thinking more of the EU’s reputation. You are thinking more about deceiving the citizens, the voters. They must not be allowed to know what is going on. Therefore, it is with considerable sadness that I say ‘yes, this time these other institutions can be granted discharge’. I can do so with a clear conscience. Most of you cannot.</p>

      <p sl="de">What I have to present here is an object lesson for all those who are interested in the way political decisions are actually made, a didactic play about the failure of control to function in this Parliament. When the political science students of the future or citizens who are interested in politics get wind of it, it will be a classic. As part of the discharge report, we took over, word for word, passages provided by members of the main Groups expressing opinions that were critical of the agencies. For example, that it is clear that decentralisation and devolution were one of the main results of the process of Commission reform that was started in 1999, but that the Commission has still not produced a study or report or interim financial statement on this form of administrative management. This was then included in my main considerations.</p>
      <p sl="de">The author of this text, Mrs Gräßle, comes from a large group. Her amendment to the report was to remove precisely those statements. There are many other examples, including Mrs Haug’s contribution, which also related to critical remarks about the agencies, highlighting, for example, that only two of the agencies are completely independent of EU grants, while most of them are financed exclusively from EU funds – that is in one of Mrs Haug’s documents. However, here it has been cut out!</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Bösch, frequently makes very critical remarks about the agencies – but not in committee. Then when it really matters, when it is the appropriate time, when there is a real opportunity to pinpoint that there has been irresponsible proliferation amongst the agencies, that so much is in a sorry state, then, at the request of the large groups, it is simply deleted. As if that were not enough, what others are allowed to do, I, as rapporteur, may not do. Thus the whole explanatory statement is simply censored, so I will therefore take the liberty to read out what otherwise would no longer be accessible to the public from the plenary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The part that was cut out reads: ‘Decentralisation and devolution were key objectives of the Commission reform process starting in 1999. To date, no assessment of this process has been submitted. In addition, the Commission has never given a convincing explanation of the added value provided by the decentralised agencies, why their tasks could not equally well be performed within the Commission, or, as in many cases, why action by the European Union was required in the area concerned in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, the result has been irresponsible proliferation. New agencies have been set up on the basis of bizarre political decisions. These new agencies are not subject to control and are often uncontrollable, mostly inefficient and, above all, they give rise to significant burdens on European taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, an unprecedented range of staff privileges has become established. In other words, the Commission's reform efforts, whose aims were linked to assurances concerning responsibility, accountability, efficiency, a new European service culture and transparency, have proved a spectacular failure. The unacceptable confusion in the area of devolution and decentralisation policy is now clear for all to see. Responsible action this is not.’</p>
      <p sl="de">Even a rapporteur is not allowed to include this in an explanatory statement. Of course, it fits with this political scenario that, when the debate began on the twenty reports that I presented to the Committee, every time anyone else spoke, the amendments had been prepared and also censored behind their back.</p>

    <intervention id="2-027" speaker_id="28126" name="Christofer Fjellner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I shall begin by discussing discharge regarding the European Development Fund. Many of you here were perhaps expecting another tall, Nordic young man to be doing this job, namely our colleague Alexander Stubb, but, as some of you will know, Alexander is unable to be here with us today as he has been appointed Finland’s new Minister of Foreign Affairs. He therefore asked me to take over and present his work and his report here today. I believe that I am speaking for the majority here when I say that we are sad to lose Alexander, but that it is great news for Alexander and especially great news for Finland.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I would like to start by congratulating him on the work he has done here on the European Development Fund. Work in committee went very well, and it is a united committee which is discussing discharging the development funds today. The European Development Funds are, of course, one of the means of promoting democracy and economic development in the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States. It is for this reason that I think it is gratifying to be able to see that the money is being used in a correct and responsible manner. In 2006 they had considerable resources, EUR 3 billion in commitments, and managed to pay out just under 90% of this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the fact that here today we are pleased to be able to grant, and propose the granting of discharge to the Commission which has managed these development funds – and this is something we really are pleased about – does not mean that there are no challenges or that there are no areas which we need to work on in the future. I would just like to bring up a few of these. For example, unlike last year, we can state that the Court of Auditors did not present an entirely clean statement of assurance, but pointed out a number of problems, for example regarding evidence of transactions which could have been better documented and regarding payments from different delegations. However, I would like to give the Commission credit for having taken these problems seriously and presented concrete, correct and important solutions to these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Furthermore, in our report we also highlight the problems incurred by the delay in implementing the modern IT system. This is a matter which we take seriously, and we hope that the Commission is working on it further.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Enough of the more administrative and economic aspects, as there are also a number of politically important issues which I would like to raise. Firstly, the fact that the work of the European Development Fund could be made considerably easier if it were incorporated in the ordinary budget. Similarly, we believe that if we had one financial regulation which controlled all current and future development funds, that would also make work easier.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That is enough about the European Development Fund. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly mention something about discharge of the independent agencies. I bring this up partly because I have been responsible for this work in the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, but possibly mainly because the rapporteur, as we heard just now, has an unusual attitude, to say the least, and has not exactly taken the line the committee chose to follow. I think it is very strange that Hans-Peter Martin has not chosen to remove his name from all these reports, considering that it is not his opinion which we will be voting on in plenary here today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If, nevertheless, I am to say something about the work itself, about some of the important opinions that, despite everything, we have in these reports – and which we have obtained thanks to successful and close cooperation between the Socialist Group, our group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – I would just like to highlight the fact that we grant discharge because we think that there are grounds in the Court of Auditors’ statement for approving the management of the finances of these independent agencies. However, alongside that, there are also problems there, which we hope will be worked on further. This particularly involves all the institutions – the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – being better at examining the agencies’ requests. I hope that everyone will take responsibility for this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will return next year, when I will be the rapporteur on this issue and hope to be able to discuss it with the Commission in greater depth.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Mr Jørgensen, rapporteurs, Honourable Members of Parliament, allow me to thank Parliament, the Budget Control Committee, the rapporteur Mr Jørgensen, and his fellow rapporteurs on the report they have produced and the Committee’s recommendation that the budget for 2006 should be discharged. I would also like to thank Alexander Stubb for his report dealing with the discharge in respect of the use of instruments under the European Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="et">Despite the fact that the European Court of Auditors was unable to give a statement of full assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions for the year 2006, the results of its audit are the best since the practice of giving a statement of assurance began. The Court of Auditors acknowledged the progress we have made. I am pleased to say that Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee also acknowledged this.</p>
      <p sl="et">This year’s debate focuses on the Structural Funds, Member States’ obligations, recoveries and adjustments, and the sensitive area of external aid. Efforts must be made in all those areas. We agree that follow-up action must be taken regularly, not only because of the discharge procedure, but also because of the conditions laid down in the founding Treaty and their importance.</p>
      <p sl="et">I propose that members or representatives of the Commission should participate regularly in parliamentary meetings to discuss one of the three areas at the heart of the discharge procedure this year and to report on it. Those areas are: increasing the responsibilities of Member States in areas where responsibility is shared by the European Union and the Member States, the implementation of structural funds and monitoring funding of external actions (primarily control of funding channelled through international organisations).</p>
      <p sl="et">For May the plan is to open the usual discussion on political strategy for the year ahead in the sectors falling within my competence.</p>
      <p sl="et">In June the Commissioners responsible for the Structural Funds or their representatives and the Budgetary Control Committee should consider the preliminary results under the Structural Funds action plan. The first quarterly report on the Structural Funds action plan will be sent to Parliament in May.</p>
      <p sl="et">In July or September, the Commissioner for External Relations or her representative should give honourable members some fresher information about the Trust Funds set aside for improving external action, the transparency of European Union funding channelled through international organisations, and the controls carried out on it.</p>
      <p sl="et">As regards the Commission’s 2007 synthesis report and the results of the internal auditors’ report for 2007, I will be able to provide information in July or September, and we should continue our debate on discharging the budget, recoveries and costs of checks in conjunction with this. The Commission will issue a report on these areas in October. The latter will provide a basis on which to develop interinstitutional debate on the subject of permissible risk of error.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Commission’s official replies to the recommendations of Parliament and the Council will be given to Parliament and the Council in autumn as is customary.</p>
      <p sl="et">My colleagues Danuta Hübner and Vladimír Špidla have already given Parliament an overview of the action plan to improve the management of funds for structural actions.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Commission and the Member States plan to apply tailored measures to reduce multiple errors in the implementation of structural actions.</p>
      <p sl="et">As regards the Structural Funds, the Commission has been firm with the Member States responsible for checks on costs, and has where necessary stopped payments and carried out financial corrections. The Commission is committed to strengthening those actions and achieving tangible, measurable results.</p>
      <p sl="et">In the area of shared management, the Member States have presented summaries for declarations and audits. Member States who have failed to present summaries will be subject to legal action as provided for in Article 226 of the founding Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="et">The consistent requirement for Member States to present those summaries at the beginning of each year has begun to bear fruit.</p>
      <p sl="et">Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner has explained to Parliament the principles of European Union funding by way of aid to Iraq, and has tabled proposals on how better checks should be made on specific funding and on how to ensure greater traceability and transparency in funding. The director in charge of this process will report to Parliament during the summer.</p>
      <p sl="et">Some results have already been forthcoming.</p>
      <p sl="et">At the beginning of April a meeting was held between the Commission and the UN in Geneva; prior to the meeting there were discussions between Members of Parliament and a Commission representative, and agreement was reached on joint guidelines to be followed in all external offices with the objective of increasing the visibility of joint work. Both the UN and the Commission undertook to apply specific guidelines and to monitor their application closely.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Commission places a high value on the decisions approved by Parliament. Those decisions send citizens the message about communication and the practical use of financial instruments. We must continue on this path and convince the public that their money, which is funding the European Union budget, is in good hands.</p>

      <p sl="de">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, I would like to thank Dan Jørgensen and Alexander Stubb, as they matched the intentions of the Committee on Development one to one. We are very thankful for this because we in the Committee on Development worked very hard on this question.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union – the budgets of the European Union itself, combined with the budgets of the Member States – is by far the largest donor of development aid in the world. Nevertheless, with what is happening currently, we find that it is still far too little, and that we really ought to do more. We cannot wait until food and energy shortages in the world blow up in our face and then be surprised that people take to the streets. The money that we donate – and, as I said, we are already the world’s largest donor – needs to be targeted more precisely so that we know that the money actually reaches those who need it and that it is not dissipated and does not disappear. Therefore, we have devoted a great deal of energy to checking whether the funds that we deploy are in fact used for the intended purpose. A key emphasis for Parliament and the Committee is that 20% of the funds have to be used for basic health care and basic and further education, so as to establish a foundation for the future. Thus we have made some progress, but the Commission is still a long way from where we would like it to be. You need to do more work on it; we will keep at you.</p>
      <p sl="de">We called on you to reduce backlogs of payments from the past and indeed, arrears from before 2001 have been reduced by 39% for Europe Aid and by 49% for the European Development Fund. These are good figures, but of course they can only ever be an interim stage. In relation to development policy, we have repeatedly pointed out that it makes no sense at all to maintain two complete systems running in parallel – one for the European Development Fund and one for development aid. It must be integrated in the budget! This is a demand that we are making now and that we will make in future negotiations on financial forecasts.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns budget assistance. Increasingly, the Commission is granting countries general budget assistance. It is possible to do this, but be careful that you do not experience what we experienced with the current Member States in relation to the Structural Funds – that we transfer responsibility because the states are supposed to take responsibility, and then find out that the systems are not functioning and that ‘nobody’ was responsible for this. Hence my advice: please be certain about what you are doing from the very start.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will be with you all the way, critical but also positive. Overall, sincere congratulations to the rapporteurs and thank you very much for the cooperation.</p>

    <intervention id="2-030" speaker_id="28317" name="Jamila Madeira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and with regard to budget management, I would like to begin by expressing our concern at the fact that outstanding budgetary commitments have continued to rise and that this, combined with the replacement of the n+2 rule by n+3, a change which some Member States are due to implement for the period 2007 to 2013, might worsen the situation, with the result that funds may take longer to reach their ultimate recipients. What we are dealing with here are policies that directly affect citizens, such as the European Social Fund, and the delays could have disastrous effects in terms of the efficient and successful use of the funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards structural policies, we agree with the Court of Auditors on the need to improve control systems so as to forestall errors in projects carried out in the area of Structural Funds. More supervision, more efficient audits and effective monitoring of projects from beginning to end are needed to enable any shortcomings or errors to be remedied in good time. For this reason, the European Commission should have the logistical capacity and adequate resources to make feedback mechanisms genuinely operational and to keep auditing procedures properly under review.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is essential to use meaningful indicators and targets which should lend themselves to comparison and, as far as possible, aggregation in the short term, so that the analysis of structural policy trends can be carried out in such a way as to avoid what would inevitably be rough and hazy assessments that would not therefore be very conclusive concerning the effective application of those funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I consider it important to mention the timeliness of the Commission’s recommendation to Member States that they should make use of the simplifications provided for in the new Structural Funds regulations, for instance by using flat-rate amounts for indirect costs under the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should also like to congratulate the European Commission on the investment in the EURES network and to applaud the virtues of holding the European Year of Workers’ Mobility. They naturally highlighted the mobility-related issues we all recognise and still face. As for the European agencies that are being analysed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would just like to thank them briefly for the work they have done and, as we have all seen, we can on the whole give a very positive assessment of their activities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by drawing attention to the need to increase the appropriation for the Dublin Agency, which is now entrusted with analysing anticipated changes in employment and the business world, the aim being to bolster the socio-economic project through the assessment of applications under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. We all know how important this could be. It is therefore an area of the utmost sensitivity and importance, which should merit special attention from the European Union, namely by means of this analysis conducted by the Dublin Agency, which may in some way help to anticipate the potential crises that we can all envisage on the horizon in any one of the 27 Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="2-031" speaker_id="1914" name="Jutta Haug" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on the Environment was pleased with the work done by the Directorate-General for the Environment and the Directorate-General for Health. I know that is something you do not hear from me very often. Usually I criticise the Commission, but in this case ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Those responsible for budgets in both Directorates-General are very cooperative. Thank you very much.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Dan Jørgensen. He worked hard throughout the entire budget discharge procedure, has presented an excellent report and generously took on board all the conclusions of the Committee on the Environment on granting discharge for 2006. The Committee on Budgetary Control has thereby acknowledged what the Committee on the Environment adopted unanimously. Thank you very much for that, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I now to say a few words about our agencies. We in the Committee on the Environment were also pleased with the work and budget management of the four agencies: the European Environment Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we advised the Committee on Budgetary Control to grant discharge for the 2006 financial year, it was not done lightly. Quite to the contrary! There was frequent exchange of information with members of the management board and with the directors in the committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, several delegations from our committee visited the agencies to satisfy themselves as to the activities on the ground. Therefore it was all the more incomprehensible to us all when the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to grant discharge for three of the four agencies, for the most incredible reasons – particularly as, even if they were valid, the agencies themselves were not responsible for those points, for example staff regulations relating to temporary staff of the institution, or the location of the head office of the relevant agency, or even the way the principle of subsidiarity was observed. Phrases like: ‘There has been irresponsible proliferation,’ ‘new agencies have been set up on the basis of bizarre political decisions, these new agencies are not subject to control and are often uncontrollable, mostly inefficient and, above all, they give rise to significant burdens on European taxpayers,’ and ‘at the same time, an unprecedented range of staff privileges has become established’ – have nothing but shock value. We are all well aware that there is a deliberate scheme afoot to whip up a scandal about work at European level. I utterly abhor this scandal-mongering.</p>
      <p sl="de">Agencies are European administrative units, although they have a unique nature. They do not just drop out of the sky; they do not just occur spontaneously to the Commission alone; they are established by a proper regulatory procedure, either by codecision or in consultation or, depending on the policy field, by regulation, i.e. by legislation. This means that these agencies are brought into being by the European legislator, which means that we are the ‘adventurers’ being referred to. The budget for the agencies is part of the budget of the European Union itself. Each financial year, we discharge the director. I believe there is no section of the administration that is controlled as well as the agencies and I am therefore delighted and thankful that the committee has put a stop to this attempt to create a scandal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few moments to underline the fact that for the implementation of the budget of the European Agencies for the financial year 2006, we can support what the Court of Auditors says, since the accounts and transactions are legitimate and regular.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, I recommend greater compliance with the principles and rules in subsequent years. In the case of the Maritime Safety Agency, 43% of payment appropriations were cancelled and a concentration of transactions was recorded towards the end of the financial year. I also expressed puzzlement about the low utilisation rate for payment appropriations for anti-polluting measures at sea, despite Parliament’s continuing support for these measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">For the Aviation Safety Agency, the high rate of appropriations carried over, at 40% of operational expenditure, was also noted, as was the use of carry-overs of non-differentiated appropriations, which is a breach of the budgetary principle of annuality. The Commission is therefore called upon to review the Agency’s fee structure to bring costs and revenue for certification activities into balance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, for the Railway Agency, the use of expired contracts and irregular extensions to regular existing contracts means that it cannot be stated that all transactions were legal.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore recommend greater transparency and accuracy in future; however, in the light of the Court of Auditors’ observations I propose that Parliament grant the discharge to the executive directors of the agencies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, I would like to state that our goal is to promote cultural diversity in Europe. Our culture programme reaches citizens where they live, which is our stated goal. Accordingly, we expect extremely good management from our national cultural agencies, and I would like to add that the revision of financial regulation will improve our ability to target finance and support for small projects that citizens apply for in their own areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this also means that we have to find the right balance between cutting bureaucracy and preventing fraud which, in turn, means that we need rules that are appropriate. If citizens who need small sums in order to be able to carry out their cultural projects are not to have to fill out endless application documents, we need to simplify procedures and move to flat-rate financing. That way, we will find greater acceptance amongst the citizens of Europe for our culture programmes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs decided to give an opinion in favour of giving discharge to the Commission in this field and to the five agencies that it is responsible for.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the Commission’s management, we welcome the substantial increase in the execution of payments and we hope that this trend will continue in 2007, although we know that this year is going to be the start of a new programming period and our experience shows us that it is more difficult to fulfil this goal and that there is a degree of delay.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Civil Liberties welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors – and I quote – ‘has been able to obtain reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 are reliable’ for the five agencies that are fall within the competence of the Committee on Civil Liberties.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said this, I would like to make some observations on some points that are still not very clear regarding the implementation of budgets. Firstly, the agency Frontex, which had a low rate of implementation of the allocated funds, but this should not cause us to be pessimistic. We need to take into account that 2006 was the first year that it was actually in operation and that in the following year it showed that it could spend its whole budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">The visit by the Committee on Civil Liberties to Warsaw, to the headquarters of Frontex, was very positive. We therefore hope that in future financial years it will be able to be granted discharge with no reservations, despite the fact that the lack of political vision on the part of the Council and the Commission has made the budgetary life of this agency quite hazardous.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although perhaps this debate is not the most appropriate forum, I would like to take advantage of it to point out that the proper operation of Frontex depends, to a large extent, on the cooperation of the Member States, given the hybrid nature of the agency. If the Member States do not make the appropriate resources available, Frontex will not be able to meet its commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regarding the Eurojust agency, I would simply like to say that there is just one negative note, regarding its high number of transfers between headings, which should be better justified.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have also criticised some problems with hiring staff at the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, and we regret that the Court of Auditors considers that the situation pointed out in 2005 has still not been resolved regarding a member of staff at the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction who was sent to Brussels on a long-term mission without any clearly defined goal.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally I want to mention the case of CEPOL, the European Police College. There we do have some doubts. Mr Kallas, we have asked the European Commission to closely monitor the implementation of its budget, as there are considerable suspicions that it is not fully and strictly complying with European legislation on public procurement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, with respect to this year’s budget discharge procedure, we should be pleased with the progress made by the Commission towards more efficient utilisation of EU funds, especially in the area of the common agricultural policy. Also worthy of support is the initiative taken by some Member States to draft and publish national statements that constitute a new element in the process managing Community funds, and the remaining States should also see to this formality as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission’s undertaking to get to the bottom of all cases of violation of the procedures for placing public orders mentioned in the annual report of the Court of Auditors, and to introduce a policy of suspension of payments following the detection of serious transgressions in the system, is also significant.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As an expert in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to emphasise the continuing lack of budget planning with regard to the gender issue and am once again calling for this aspect to be taken into account as part of budget planning and the funding of Community programmes. Information on actions favouring gender equality that have received support from the social fund should be reflected in reports on budget implementation in the years to come.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin with the discharge by Parliament and by thanking our rapporteur and all Members who wanted to achieve progress on the secretarial assistance allowance, because this point is crucial, in the public’s opinion, and should also form the focus of our observations. It is in the interest of all of us as MEPs to find a way out of this dirty corner of corruption.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European People’s Party has suggested ways by which the secretarial assistance allowance could be managed more efficiently in future. These proposals were approved by a large majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control, including that the paying agents in the Member States should be notified by Parliament itself and thereby become more professional. These paying agents would then also administer the contracts for services and ensure that taxes are paid and social security contributions are deducted. These amendments protect Parliament’s reputation, as does the point that MEPs should no longer be able to employ family members in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under the rules of the EU, this means a very significant conflict of interests. Therefore, I call upon all Members to avoid further damage to ourselves and to Parliament. I note with concern that the Socialist Group, along with some of the Liberals, wants to vote against this passage of text. If they prevail, it will mean that we complete the discharge process without making any progress in this very important aspect, and that would be the absolute worst case scenario for us all, because a cheery ‘carry on’ will not get us through the latest report by the Court of Auditors on the secretarial assistance allowance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also with regard to the Parliamentary assistants’ allowance, which we agreed on together, we want to keep to the view that it is no cure-all. I want to recommend that you all read the fine print. It is all still up in the air, which means that saying at this point that the Parliamentary assistants’ allowance will help us solve every problem is simply a lie – and also a lie to the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say one last thing about the Commission budget. Commissioner, it was certainly close, and I hope that your colleagues have bought you a drink, because you have earned it. Thank you very much for the good cooperation!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs and also all my socialist colleagues, and those from other groups as well, who took part in this discharge process and who did so much to ensure it was concluded. In fact, it is precisely this European Parliament issue that I would like to comment on. I would like to say that it seems clear to me that the fundamental conclusion we can draw from the internal audit report is that there are serious shortcomings in the way the parliamentary assistance payments system works. There is no shadow of a doubt that these require the introduction of an Assistants’ Statute and the financial management tasks for payments being handed over to the European Parliament’s administration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the next parliamentary term, it is imperative that not only MEPs have a statute, but also that their assistants’ work is regulated and financed through the European institutional framework, leaving no justification for the continued existence of a publicly-funded voluntary pension scheme and making the rules on travel expenses and other general expenses clearer. The Council needs to vote in favour of this matter and prevent the institution of the European Parliament being held to ransom by trifling perks of position. In the same way it is vital that Members are guaranteed the best working conditions, while still bearing in mind the need to be governed by rules of total transparency and rigour fully in line with the general rules applicable to society.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would especially like to call on our colleagues in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats not to block this reform process. It is absolutely crucial that we reach a consensus in this Parliament on an Assistants’ Statute and that this statute is clear and governs an issue that has unnecessarily contributed to our institution losing credibility. It is paramount we achieve this and we will need everyone’s support to do so.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs who have contributed to this discharge procedure. I would like to use the two minutes available to me to discuss the Commission’s discharge report drawn up by Mr Jørgensen. The Court of Auditors published its report last November and that report was considerably better than in previous years, owing to the fact that this time, the report cited percentages. This should be continued in future reports. When the report was published, it was almost as if the Commission had triumphed. The report had never been so good. The Court of Auditors approved 44% of the Commission’s expenditure. I must say that I did not feel this was the time to sit back contently and say: ‘This is the best we have ever done’. No, we can do much better.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is striking is that the Commission actually disregarded Parliament’s recommendations in previous discharge resolutions. What has been significant for Parliament over the past three years? The national declarations. What does the Commission say? We will not respect the national declarations. This is too much. Furthermore, this is included in the financial perspective, in an interinstitutional agreement. Fortunately, the Commission has retraced its footsteps and this will now take place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is a second issue, however. The Commissioners cannot countersign the declarations of the Directors-General. It puzzles me why that is so. We can receive the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as offered by the Commission, and regularly hear their views with regard to how much progress has been made, yet the Commissioners are not permitted to sign anything with Parliament. How can this be explained from a legal perspective? I can only say, Mr President, that we hope that next year will be even better. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will adopt a constructive attitude in all of this, as it has in the past.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, for the ninth time, I have had the opportunity to participate in the process whereby Parliament approves the accounts for the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the other EU bodies. Once again, this year we have found major irregularities. The situation was particularly bad in connection with the Commission’s management of the money in the Structural Funds, where nearly EUR 4 billion (almost DKK 30 million) was paid out incorrectly. For reasons of time, I will focus my remarks on this.</p>
      <p sl="da">Once again this year we are saying that there is something wrong, and once again we are receiving assurances that things will indeed be improved. We have received such assurances every year and yet the situation continues because the entire support system is so complicated, so unreasonable and so impossible to manage. In the Committee on Budgetary Control we have raised the pivotal question: for the EU as a whole, what is the effect of the enormous reallocation of money between the Member States? After all, there are no visible improvements in the countries that receive support. Next year they will again be behind and they will receive support once again. Of the 15 old EU Member States, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have received support every single year since they became members. There are 11 Member States, all old Member States, paying for the entire net difference. Naturally, all new members receive support.</p>
      <p sl="da">Countries that implement economic reforms and work effectively, and where the citizens are willing to pay high taxes, must pay countries that will not reform their obsolete structures or demand particularly high taxes. The EU’s support policy is to a large extent doing nothing! Why carry out reforms when it is possible to send the bill for not doing so to the citizens of other countries? The entire reallocation is foolish. Not only do many billions end up in the wrong hands, but the support philosophy itself is sick because it rewards countries that will not implement reforms and punishes those that are doing just that, countries that the EU needs. The EU could perform its tasks with 15% of the current budget! In addition, we would also be free of all such cases of economic scandal. Therefore, I personally intend to vote against approval of the Commission’s accounts.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control for the considerable amount of good work that they have done.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will limit my contribution to the Commission’s discharge and that of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to the Commission’s discharge, we are faced with problems that have been sufficiently explained, particularly by the rapporteurs: the fact that the Court of Auditors reported a great many problems in relation to the structural funds, that in fact 12% should not have been paid out (EUR 4 billion, which is an enormous amount) and, with regard to external relations, the fact that, among other things, cooperation with the United Nations is going poorly and awkwardly. These are the problems that we have discussed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This was a significant discharge, because it is the last discharge before the elections. We have another discharge next year, but this will be held during a pre-election phase. It was therefore a significant discharge and we have had to exact dialogue. I am delighted that we did this in a highly constructive manner, across the groups. The fact that we have twice organised a hearing with Commissioners Špidla and Hübner and the fact that we – Mr Jørgensen, Mr Mulder, Mrs Gräßle and I – have been able to exact information from the Commission by means of a joint letter, has led to an excellent result. I sincerely hope that we can achieve a better result next year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to Parliament, I would like to concentrate on two major problems. In relation to the assistants’ statute, we have the internal audit, conducted by the internal auditor. I must commend him on this; it is an excellent document. I still do not understand, Mr President, why you and the Bureau have not published this audit. After all, this is currently surrounded by secrecy and this is not necessary, because we, as Parliament, have always requested that this audit be carried out and that an inquiry be conducted into how the secretariat allowances are managed. I now firmly believe that we must implement that statute. I have submitted a number of other amendments to reinforce Mr Pomés Ruiz’s existing text. This must take place in dialogue with the Commission, but also in dialogue with the Council in particular, because if, in the near future, we approach the Council with a problem that it fails to follow up on, then we are not where we need to be. This must therefore be done in dialogue with the Commission and with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One final item that I would like to mention is that the voluntary pension fund causes me a great deal of concern. Firstly, the actuarial shortfall is continuing to increase, and secondly, I would also like the list of participants in that voluntary pension fund to finally be published.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole Parliament and all my colleagues are pleased about the progress made in using European appropriations more effectively. We cannot avoid pointing out, however, that there are still some major deficiencies. The Commission should launch infringement proceedings and penalties against Member States that do not apply, or only partially apply, the regulations on the Structural Funds. The Member States should provide all information about corrections and financial recoveries, especially for forthcoming financial management.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission should present Parliament with an evaluation of the quality of annual reports received from individual countries, especially broken down by area of intervention and by different policies. The most important area is that of the Structural Funds, where there is still a significant volume of improper repayments, at 12%.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission must explain how it will ensure this money will be recovered, especially in cases where projects have not been accepted through the use of tendering procedures. Faster and more effective suspension procedures should be used against Member States that do not carry out adequate checks.</p>
      <p sl="it">The thing I want to emphasise, which seems to me the greatest deficiency of this budget, is external actions: there is not enough information on these, though they benefit from a number of European activities. In particular the Commission should provide greater visibility over projects financed by the European Union for reconstruction in Iraq in 2006; for example, it should list the projects, what they are, the anticipated costs, and the agencies involved.</p>
      <p sl="it">This information has been supplied, rather late, but I still do not think it is satisfactory. Specifically, I think that for this type of use of funds, we should look at the idea of using the European Agency for Reconstruction, as Parliament has highlighted in the past.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will quickly come to Parliament’s discharge. First of all, there is the issue of the three sites, raised by the rapporteur, for which the environmental cost should also be added to the financial cost. Finally, the internal report on the management of expenditure for assistants: I believe it was wrong to keep it confidential, because this has led to a whole series of articles in the press that are damaging transparency and the proper functioning of Parliament. For this reason, we ask for this internal audit to be published.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the limited time I am allowed to comment on this lengthy report, I would like to make two observations. First, it contains a great many empty platitudes about the supporting paperwork MEPs should provide to support claims from their parliamentary assistants’ allowance. In the light of recent events it is painfully clear that the arrangements currently in place are wholly inadequate, as they are subject to gross serial abuse by many Members. Furthermore, it is equally clear that there is no serious intention to do anything about these abuses, as I understand the system will not change before the new Parliament convenes in autumn 2009. Therefore I cannot take the report’s censorious tones at all seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I draw Members’ attention to the rather sinister clause 55 of the report, which reveals that, as from 2008, European political parties may be financed up to 85% from the European Parliament budget. It then goes on to point out that this high level of subsidy entails an additional degree of responsibility with regard to their activities. In other words, the EU finances political parties and also controls their activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is Big Brother writ large and provides even more evidence of the disastrous decline of democracy in Europe generated by this increasingly totalitarian European Union. As a democrat I abhor it, and to those who support it: shame on you.</p>

The BBC faces a prima facie charge of breaching its Royal Charter, specifically in its failure to provide balanced and objective reporting of current affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EIB’s claims that the BBC’s editorial policy has not been influenced by these loans is simply beyond belief. As a result of many years’ research, not least by Lord Pearson – at his considerable expense – it has become obvious that the BBC has, in effect, been bought by the EIB on behalf of the EU. As a result of that, BBC senior management now seem to regard themselves as above the law. We shall see shortly whether Scotland Yard police agree.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will keep to the report on the discharge for the other institutions and thank the rapporteur, Mr Lundgren, for his cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the institutions are concerned, I would like to point out first and foremost that we must at last find the legal basis for their discharge in the Financial Regulation – and this applies particularly to the Council. The current practice, that Parliament undertakes discharge of the Secretary-General of the Council and the other institutions, is not enshrined in the Financial Regulation, nor is it consistent with Article 274 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particularly in sensitive areas such as budgetary control, reference to a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ dating back to the 1970s is no longer appropriate and contradicts the principles of legal clarity and legal truth. We therefore call upon the Commission to submit a suitable proposal by September 2008, so as to rectify this shortcoming. That is why I am asking that all Members back our amendment No 1 on discharge of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">that these costs will be lost sight of? that administrative costs will predominate over these costs?</p>
      <p sl="de">Now I will address the costs for common external and security policy again. It is imperative, for the greatest possible transparency, that the Council resists the temptation to prioritise administrative costs at the expense of these costs in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">hit the jackpot?</p>
      <p sl="de">This year, as every year, building policies of the institutions is an area in which budgetary control has proved worthwhile. Take the Court of Auditors, for example, which did not even bother to put its own extension building out to tender or negotiate contracts for it, even though it is responsible for financing.</p>
      <p sl="de">am a bit worried that this may be meant to be 'procurement' except I would expect to see Beschaffung, so have stuck with award/vergabe</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to bring up again the regulations on awarding of contracts. It is unthinkable to convey to our citizens that every small municipality, when it has a contract of more than 200 000 euros to award, must call for tenders throughout all of Europe, when the institutions themselves do not observe the regulations on awarding of contracts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me a last word on the Court of Auditors. I greatly regret that, according to our report, the Court of Auditors should be organised according to the European Central Bank model. I fear renationalisation of this institution, which ought to be kept free of all political influence from Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone who worked to prepare this important discharge for 2006 and supported our rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is perhaps the most important discharge that we have undertaken during this term. We see the problems, and we still have time to resolve those problems. I would like at this point to convey our particular thanks to the European Court of Auditors, the authority of whose reports grows from year to year. It would just be good if, from time to time, the Court of Auditors could withstand the temptation to populism. We remember the stud farm associations and the golf clubs, and all that goes with them. Those were more political assessments than the assessments of a court of auditors.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the European Commission which, in the end, negotiated a tight follow-up with us, also under pressure from a tough-talking rapporteur from this committee. Commissioner Kallas has already mentioned how we want to proceed in the coming months. National declarations by the Member States are important. Council is not here today – we can see that – they are not paying attention to how their taxpayers’ taxes are being used, so we have to do it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will make progress in structural policies. Commissioner Kallas, we will continue to have difficulties in external policy. We pointed out the first time that this external policy was not sufficiently monitored, even though we are spending billions on it. In the world of international finance, it is usual for voting rights to be allocated according to the obligations to make contributions. If the European Union contributes more than 40% to rebuilding Iraq, for example, I would have liked us to have more than 40% of the participation rights and codecision rights. There is still a long way to go, so there is much to be done here.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control for doing an excellent job. Now before us are 30 reports on discharge pertaining to the year 2006. The most important of them is the Commission’s, which relates to 97% of the EU’s budget. The rest relate to the EU’s other institutions and separate agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my opinion, the way the matter of discharge is dealt with by Parliament should be improved. The Committee on Budgetary Control cannot be a Court of Auditors and still less a firm of accountants. It is a physical impossibility for it to conduct a detailed examination of the administration and accounts of 30 units. Parliament has to put its trust in experts and the opinions of official bodies. Of these, the European Court of Auditors, internal monitoring bodies, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are the most important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even the most stringent detailed examination of accounts and administration only results in what is an apparent degree of accuracy, and that does not make the outcome any more reliable. There is no direct correlation between the way discharge is dealt with and the number of reports produced. On the contrary, when Parliament grants discharge to a single agency, for example, that might be too strong an assurance that the accounts and administration were meticulously attended to.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If Parliament really wants to strengthen its role in the discharge process it should revise its practices. Otherwise, the Committee on Budgetary Control will be inundated with work.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in Mr Jørgensen’s report consideration has quite rightly been given – following the opinion of the Court of Auditors – to the problems of funding the common agricultural policy, and specifically to the fact that some of its beneficiaries have nothing to do with agriculture. Golf clubs, cricket clubs, horse riding clubs, leisure parks – may they prosper, but not on common agricultural policy funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This afternoon in this House we shall be debating the food crisis and the rise in food prices, and surely one of the reasons for this crisis is that EU funds that should be used to to support agriculture are being used to support completely different businesses that can manage perfectly well without this help. This is why I am fully behind the conclusions contained in Articles 99 and 100 of Mr Jørgensen’s report, which point to the need for changes in the funding of the common agricultural policy to ensure that aid is chanelled only to real farmers – those who use the land for agricultural purposes – and these changes must be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

He said: ‘The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing’. That is the case here in Parliament as well. We have known for decades that a great deal of tampering has been taking place with regard to assistants’ allowances, travel allowances, allowances for general expenditure, daily allowances, funds for visiting groups and funds for political groups. I hope that Parliament is finally going to do something about this before the 2009 elections, and that these will not be just empty promises as has been the case over the past few decades.

The call to publicise EU single payments deserves special recognition. In my country, Finland, national subsidies are nevertheless twice the value of EU aid. Unfortunately, the data on the recipients of EU aid do not tell the whole truth about single payments.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Under pressure from the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Commission has improved the way in which the accounts are inspected and has promised to put more effort into clawing back payments made for the wrong reasons. Similarly, there is better quality information now available on financing under external actions, thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, we have come a long way in terms of openness and the battle against fraud within the EU. When I was first elected in 1979, the group chairmen led the way in taking from the till. First a chauffer-driven limousine paid for by Parliament, and then a dip into the Members’ funds to get business-class travel for the same journey plus a little extra! Nowadays, the chairmen are leading the way in the clean-up operation. However, there is a long way to go and we have been dealt a severe knock-back with the majority decision to not make the internal audit report public. How can we be the guardians of others when we dare not address our own problems? The large groups carry a heavy burden of responsibility, as the voting percentage for Parliament next time may fall below 40%, seriously weakening the legitimacy of the election.</p>
      <p sl="da">I had hoped that one day I would be able to vote in favour of a set of annual accounts because there was no longer anything to criticise. However, the large groups are again recommending that we rubber-stamp the Commission’s accounts even though we still do not have complete access to them in order to check them. What would an auditor say to a set of accounts if he did not have access to all the annexes? For 14 years in a row, the Court of Auditors have declared that they cannot verify the correctness of the underlying transactions, and therefore unfortunately for the 29th year in a row I must again vote against approval.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on Budgetary Control and others in the House for their joint initiative over many years aimed at cleaning up the EU. When I first began, during the budget I met a person who was known as ‘Skimmed milk’. He received DKK 1.3 billion and was the biggest Danish beneficiary of EU funds. I could not even obtain a statistical breakdown of what the biggest recipients of the money were receiving for example. From next year onwards, all recipients of agricultural support will be disclosed on the Internet. Four years ago the Commission’s working groups were a big secret. Now we will also be able to see on the internet who the consultants are, thanks to our combined pressure. In addition, we have also enjoyed good support within the Commission from Mr Kallas. I would like to express my thanks for this. I will miss those I work with when I leave Parliament on 9 May. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! We have come a long way, but not yet far enough. However, I am certain that you will continue the work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in 1944 Friedrich Hayek made the prescient observation that the delegation of particular technical tasks to separate bodies, while a regular feature, is the first step by which a democracy progressively relinquishes its powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues should ask themselves how much democratic control there is over the various European agencies. We might get the odd committee visit to them, or express general opinions on what their mandates should be, but, in general, the role of this Parliament is to vote through the necessary supply, annually and unconditionally. Thus, the European Union is being run by a standing apparat.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be fair, it is not alone. Within many of the Member States, my own included, there has been a similar process, whereby elected representatives have given away their powers. What makes the EU unusual is that these various bodies have only the flimsiest of legal bases. True, they would have been authorised by the European Constitution. But that constitution – it seems necessary periodically to remind this House – was rejected at the ballot box. Therefore, many of these agencies – the Human Rights Agency, the Defence Agency, the External Borders Agency and so on – are at best irregular, and at worst illegal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, much has already been said today on the subject of Parliament’s discharge. I would therefore like to limit myself to the observation that I, most certainly as a former assistant, hope that the assistants’ statute, which has already been discussed in such detail, will finally materialise, because if we are honest, the current regulations offer too much room for manoeuvre. That is the problem. Many Members manage this correctly, yet there is no guarantee at present. The rules must therefore be tightened up and Parliament’s departments will have to take more consistent action in cases where the rules are not correctly applied. This is an area in which our departments have sometimes made errors, including in the past.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having said that, I would like to focus on granting the Commission discharge and on what, in my opinion, is the main problem, which occurs every year and is the cause of many a headache: to be specific, the difficult position in which we currently find ourselves between European and national level; a position that is due to the fact that the Commission is fully accountable for European expenditures, whilst 80% of these are managed by the Member States. It has already been stated that there have indeed been positive developments, for example in the agricultural sector. However, the only way we can get ourselves out of this difficult position is via the national management declarations, which are already currently being submitted by four Member States. In the Jørgensen report, we as Parliament state in plain language that, in this regard, the current annual summaries are just an initial cautious step towards these management declarations. I am also aware, however, that an amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation is required in order to implement the national declarations. In any case, I am content for the moment with the Commission’s promise of last month, that it will also encourage the other Member States to submit national declarations. I deliberately say ‘content for the moment’, Commissioner, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating and my group will follow up on how the Commission fulfils this promise by means of concrete actions in the coming months. Moreover, the fact that the Council is not present today indicates that a great deal has yet to be achieved. We will consider these conclusions, if we are here again next year for the 2007 discharge.

Every year the European Parliament examines the management of the European agencies and relies on the work done by the European Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office to do so. As a result of our joint long, meticulous, analytical and preparatory work we are now in a position to give a decision on the 2006 management of the Community agencies and it is indeed fortunate that with the agreement of the European Court of Auditors we can propose all the agencies for acceptance. This does not mean that we did not find any faults in the management but that we did not find any faults serious enough to prevent acceptance. I would also like to point out that the political groupings have already voted in favour, with a wide democratic majority, and I now propose here, in plenary, that we accept the work of the agencies even if the rapporteur is not entirely at one with the report.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, since the beginning of the term of office, I have been analysing the results of the work of the EU agencies on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. I would like to point out that the number of agencies has nearly doubled in the current year. Despite some critical remarks in the speech of the rapporteur regarding the work of these agencies, I find it necessary to mention certain positive changes compared with last year. There is an increase in transparency and democratic responsibility as a result of the implementation of Parliament’s suggestion to have the agencies’ work assessed by the relevant committees.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nevertheless, some problems still remain. In this regard we should determine the position of the agencies’ activities within the EU management system. As I have already mentioned, the number of agencies has grown considerably and we get the blame for that; and even Parliament sometimes shares the opinion that it is an indirect way of increasing bureaucracy. Perhaps, however, it highlights the need to review the EU management system along with that of the European Commission, especially the system of management and administration. A series of projects are currently being implemented with the aim of improving the system. It seems that we should consider a more radical reform, which would yield positive results and contribute to achieving more transparency in the work of both the agencies and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, there are three matters to which I would like to draw attention in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Although the Court of Auditors has acknowledged that in general terms the financial report of the European Communities is an honest representation of the financial situation at the end of December 2006, and that it did not find any flagrant inaccuracies concerning own funds and expenditure incurred, it did find many errors both in sums recorded in accounts ledgers and in reports supplied by the Member States. One cause for particular concern is that some types of inaccuracy are repeated year on year, despite critical comments from the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another cause for concern is the continuing rise in outstanding budget commitments still to be paid, especially in respect of the old Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, in view of those comments, I would like to record my satisfaction with the overall improvement in expenditure on the common agricultural policy, which has been achieved largely through application of the AJAX system, which significantly limits the risk of improper expenditure.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, in 2006 the European Union devoted 39% of its budget, EUR 38.9 billion in all, to structural spending. The annual European Court of Auditors report established that the European Commission had taken numerous steps concerning the use of structural and cohesion funds as part of its far-reaching supervision. While financial absorption has manifestly improved, the report draws attention to the fact that in 2006 at least 12% of allocations to structural projects could not be recovered. This represents around EUR 4 billion, and there were performance errors with 20% of the projects.</p>
      <p sl="hu">For years there have been numerous problems with the multi-layer management of the Structural Funds and their shared management. A cause of the relatively high proportion of the irregularities discovered and incorrect reimbursements is, primarily, the poor efficiency of the Member State control systems and the supervisory systems based on them. The greatest problem I see is that there is no unified evaluation model used by everyone, no yardstick or benchmarking system, and there is no effective way of measuring the projects.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Although the Structural Funds are an extremely important source that can be allocated for mutual development, we can only attain a reduction in the number of abuses of the common purse if the Member States and the European Commission act jointly and in harmony to cut back on the illegal use of money. The efficiency of the Member States’ supervisory systems also needs to be improved and standardised. Moreover, it is essential that the Commission makes its supervision of structural spending more effective, setting up suspension and adjustment procedures and developing a new Member State reporting system, bearing in mind that there are problems with 40% of the Commission audits. Given all this, our delegation proposes a discharge. Thank you for your attention.</p>

It is, however, true that, through a very constructive dialogue – arduous but very constructive – with the Commission, in which we must especially recognise the efforts made by the Commissioners for Regional Development and Employment, there has been real progress made on aspects of improving monitoring of all aspects related to both employment and the Structural Funds.</p>

Why do we keep secret the names of the 407 Members who benefit from EUR 27 000 each paid into a voluntary pension fund, amongst them myself? Why do we have no controls over those Members who embezzle nearly EUR 14 000 each year by making private payments into that pension fund from the public purse?

      <p sl="fr">As regards the update of the actuarial position (paragraph 71), this exists but will first be presented to the fund’s board of directors. Allow me to point out here that Parliament wasted EUR 36 000 having a so-called independent actuarial report done. Where is it? What are its conclusions? As far as I know, they are no different from those of the fund’s actuaries.</p>

As the shadow rapporteur for the ENVI opinion (Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) on exemption for 2006, I would like to thank Jutta Haug and the rapporteur for a very solid piece of work. I feel that the work of the four agencies we dealt with is extremely important, that what they do is without any doubt of great help to the European Parliament and the various EU bodies, and so improves the quality of life of EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control plays an important part in opinion formation on disease control and the risk of new and emerging infectious diseases. I could add my thanks that this year Hungary was first in disease prevention, as we had the smallest number of people infected with diseases against which there had been a vaccination campaign.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The work of the European Environment Agency is indispensable in the gathering and collation of information on environmental protection, and the European Medicines Agency plays a significant role in the protection of public health and animal health. I feel the agency’s collaboration in the development of new medicines is extremely important. The European Food Safety Authority offers indispensable support in the areas of animal health and plant protection.</p>
      <p sl="hu">An important point is that all the agencies have redistributed their available annual budget. As the rapporteur points out, this is because of the complexity of the tasks. It would be useful to highlight this more in future planning. I welcome the rapporteur’s proposals on the importance of internal control and the need to strengthen it. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the importance of the committee material explaining the role of the agencies. The agencies have a necessary role to play, but transparency and effectiveness dictate the need for clarification of their place in the governance of the Union. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor. We have arrived at the end of the long, tension-filled process and at today’s long-anticipated vote on the 2006 discharge, which can deservedly be regarded as a red letter day and a milestone in the annals of the European Parliament. A red letter day, as this is the first time that the European Court of Auditors has confronted us all with the 12% fault rate for the Structural Funds, which the sensation-hungry tabloid press naturally dished up as four billion missing euros. The Committee on Budgetary Control, which has responsibility in this matter, carried out the resulting work in full awareness of its political and professional responsibilities, with the assistance of Mr Jørgensen, the Danish rapporteur. Its aim was not to cause a scandal or stir up a sensation with unforeseeable consequences, but to apply the principles of transparent disclosure and come up with proposals which would offer a guarantee for avoiding such problems in the future And here we found a very good partner in the person of Vice-President Siim Kallas, to whom I would like to give particular thanks, and I am sure that we will in all probability be able to resolve all such issues in the future. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention an aspect of importance concerning the discharge, namely the evaluation of actions through sampling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When I was preparing my working document on the Commission’s management of the CARDS programme on assistance for the Balkans, as part of the discharge, only 2.32% of operations could be audited by the Court of Auditors in order to evaluate the management methods used by the European Union for external actions in this region of Europe. One of the effects of the small sample size was that the Court of Auditors was unable to analyse the impact of external action on Montenegro because, out of the 256 actions financed, not one was examined.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under these circumstances, how can impact really be measured? What scientific and financial reliability should be accorded to these evaluation reports? Although, from a statistical point of view, small samples can be used to estimate the behaviour of the systems, the samples still need to be representative, which was not the case with the appropriations used to finance actions in Montenegro under the CARDS programme. Collectively, European taxpayers would gain from an improvement in the Court of Auditor’s methods for analysing samples in order to identify more clearly the effectiveness of appropriations from our budget.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasize two issues I consider very important as regards the discharge of the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The first issue refers to the co-involvement of Member States in implementing the European budget. Although we have a joint management procedure between the Commission and Member States for 80% of the European budget, I believe new measures should be introduced in order to increase participation in all the budgetary process phases.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As regards control, I support the introduction of national declarations, endorsed by the Court of Accounts of each Member State, which would force the governments and payment agencies to take responsibility for the correct and objective assignment of Community funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, the action of suspending all payments in the case of detecting any deficiency should be used with considerable caution and only if serious problems are found in managing European funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The worryingly low absorption rates in the new Member States are the second extremely important aspect of budgetary discharge. It is not normal for all new Member States to have absorption rates 30% lower than initially expected in average.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For me, this signals not their incapacity to absorb European funds, but possible excessive bureaucracy from European institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I find myself in the very unusual situation of agreeing partly with something that Mr Hannan said just now, which was when he voiced his concern about the proliferation of agencies. We seem to create agencies more according to the desire of every Member State to have one on its territory, and then spread them like confetti around the Union, than according to a real and genuine need to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">If this trend continues, it will indeed lead to governance by agency at the expense, frankly, of the Commission, which is our executive and which is accountable to Parliament, and much more directly than the agencies, even if we do have more means than Mr Hannan admitted to control them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where I depart from him of course is when he goes over the top, as he usually does, and claims that these agencies have been created illegally. That is, of course, absolute nonsense. They were all created on the basis of the current Treaties, with a proper and due legal base. Whether it was wise to do so is another question, and we should certainly be very careful before we create any new agencies in the future.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Parliament is a political body and I think we ought to consider the issues we are debating in a political manner. The measure which ought to link our activities, in my view, tells us two things. Let me take two examples from our discussions. The first is the matter of independent authorities or agencies. Of course, there is the question of major expansion of all these agencies, but it is impossible to say that the decentralisation of the independent agencies is not particularly useful. As there is a problem with great expansion, we will say no to all the independent agencies? Naturally this would not be possible.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second relates to the infamous issue of our colleagues’ salaries. This certainly is a problem, and we said so in committee. There is a vast difference, however, between saying that there is a problem and not giving exemption to Parliament for an entire year, and also between making very populist remarks, such as that we are all responsible and that claiming that there is no transparency. How can there be no transparency? We, the members of the committee, have seen the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">The discussion on discharge has been very intensive this year, and the Commission has made several commitments to follow up Parliament’s observations and recommendations. We will continue this intensive process, starting in May, when there will be a discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control about our plans for next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an intensive process, and I would like to assure Parliament that we take our commitments very seriously and are going ahead with the proposals and ideas we have in common on increasing accountability, on cooperation with Member States and on increasing the responsibility of Member States in shared management issues. That is our common line, and we will work seriously on all those action plans and proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are different types of agencies. Firstly, there are executive agencies, which are clearly the responsibility of the Commission, and for which you give discharge to the Commission. We have some executive agencies, but have decided to have a moratorium on the establishment of new executive agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are the concerns surrounding traditional agencies? The problem of governance is a serious one, and there are several weak points as regards how to administer and handle those agencies. We should probably hold serious discussions on governance issues, but we should also not underestimate the political observations on their work – what they are doing and what the real benefits are – and Parliament has a very important role to play in evaluating and assessing how successful they are. Neither should we underestimate the positive aspects of both decentralisation and of having European bodies spread across Europe. That is not such a bad idea, if everybody considers his or her own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank you once again for all your contributions, remarks, debates and discussions. We will continue with our commitments and action plans.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kallas. It is clear that we have been through a process where the waves have been a little choppy at times. There has been conflict between ourselves in Parliament and the Commission. However, it is a conflict that we have managed to transform into a dialogue. It has led to some good results and some good pledges from the Commission, and also to some very concrete action plans with specific deadlines and specific success criteria. We must persist during times when some Members from the more EU-sceptic groups say: ‘it is just words, and words that have been said before’. This is not true! It is certainly not just about words, but about specific actions, which the Commission is now promising to implement. Some measures have already been implemented. In addition, some very specific deadlines have also been established, which we will be able to monitor. A key element is that we will now have a commissioner who will meet with the committee once a month in order to follow this process. This really is a great stride forward.</p>
      <p sl="da">That said, by way of conclusion I would like to remind people why these problems arise. One of the reasons is that a considerable proportion of the funds is administered under shared management, i.e. 80% of the EU’s funds are managed by the Member States. It is the responsibility of the Commission to follow the Treaty and it is a cross that it must bear. Therefore, we strongly criticise the Commission. However, in reality, much of the problem lies with the Member States. This is the reason why here in Parliament we are such staunch supporters of the idea of annual national audit declarations, signed at the appropriate political level, i.e. by the finance minister. This is happening already in a number of countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden. If we could achieve something similar in all EU countries, we would find that these auditing obligations would be taken more seriously in the individual countries. I think that we would actually gain a really good tool for eliminating those areas where things are not working in the individual countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, sometimes we cannot see the wood for the trees. In this discharge procedure we have to say what is going wrong, and sometimes we forget how many things are going well, how many extremely competent staff we have in the Commission and in this House, in Parliament, including the ushers, so many services, the translators, the interpreters , who provide an excellent service. We forget how we are able to stretch the budget that we have in order to fulfil our objectives, how Parliament and the Commission have made more and more progress on the transparency policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is still a challenge, a very important challenge for Parliament, which is the communication and information policy. It was one of the objectives that Parliament had for 2006, and I am not happy with how it has developed. We have elections in a year’s time, and we need to know how to get there, which means improving our information procedures and continuing to be transparent, as we are being. Transparency, and I was rapporteur for this report, is compatible with having documents that are not public, as occurs in the Member States, for journalists, in businesses and in families. It is good for our work if there are levels of drafting criteria that have not passed through the sieve of public approval, and must therefore logically be the secret of those of us who are working on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am entirely satisfied with the access that I have had to all of the information, and I think that the report that I am presenting on Parliament’s accounts is a responsible report. I say that Parliament’s accounts should be discharged, because Parliament, if you will allow me to say so, operates very well, and much better than some national parliaments, in a much more transparent way and with staff who work more hours than may be worked in similar parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is not to say, therefore, that it is perfect: we need to keep working. We still have a long way to go, but in this political year, we have a positive picture of how we have used the money that our citizens have given us; we have used it well, transparently and coherently.</p>

      <p sl="de">Jutta Haug described my critical comments in the explanatory statement and in the main text as abhorrent and as scandal-mongering. I would like to read out a few quotations: ‘The Heads of State and Government are inventing one agency after another. The agencies are eating up our money. There are no proper checks as to whether the agencies are really necessary. There is an extensive area free of control where nobody is really accountable. No planning is apparent. One agency after another is created, in order to be paid for consent to difficult topics by an undertaking for an interesting agency.’</p>
      <p sl="de">These are all quotations from Herbert Bösch. They are much more critical than what I wrote. Aha! When I write it, it is called ‘scandal-mongering’, but Herbert Bösch, or course, is a member of the party and fits in with it. Yes, I have experienced this before. This is what I mean when I talk about the ‘doublespeak’ that rules here. This is the hypocrisy of the ‘special’ class, that people say ‘it is dreadful to mention a scandal explicitly in an official Parliamentary paper’ but then make critical comments publicly. This is one of the fundamental problems in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, people may have different opinions on whether or not to grant discharge, but that is not what these passages, which I read out at the beginning, were about – not at all. Rather, they were about basic considerations where, when it comes down to it, there is a real opportunity to show their true colours, people once again cover up what is going on here. That is the truly great problem for democracy in Europe, that the system here is not self-regulating, that it merely involves mutual backslapping.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I would like to take this opportunity to provide a little constructive criticism to the Commission and to the decentralised agencies, as I still think that the rapporteur, Hans-Peter Martin, has not managed to do so. As the rapporteur responsible for this question next year, I would like to focus on three main issues. They are also raised in the reports.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The first is evaluating the opportunities of grouping together the administrative functions of a majority of the smaller agencies, and so releasing resources and expertise in complying with the complicated regulatory framework surrounding the agencies. Many of these decentralised agencies have problems complying with overriding budgetary principles, for example, or the Financial Regulation, procurement legislation, etc. This is a recurring opinion here, and one which I hope the Commission will take further.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also propose that the independent agencies, like other institutions, have their staff appropriations reduced by a percentage equivalent to posts which it is believed will not be filled. I believe that this too could free up considerable resources.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last but not least, we propose that the assigned revenue which agencies pay in to the Commission each year and which is returned be deducted against the proposal in the budget on which the European Parliament is reaching a decision.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These are the three issues on which I would like to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Commission and the decentralised agencies during this period, until I take over the discharge process.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would also like to say something about the Court of Auditors’ special report on the control, inspection and sanction systems relating to the rules on conservation of Community fisheries resources. It is, after all, part and parcel with discharge of the Commission which we are addressing today, and the Court of Auditors delivers a devastating criticism, which must lead to wide-ranging reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Three conclusions which I have drawn, and which can also be found in the report we will be voting on, are first and foremost that it is unacceptable for Member States, year after year, to set quotas at a higher level than recommended by researchers for sustainable fisheries, secondly that the Commission and the Member States must be tougher when it comes to combating breaches of or fraud against the quota system and, thirdly, that we must draw up a new fisheries policy which strengthens the incentives and reasons for professional fishermen to protect stocks. These are three additional thoughts which I would like you to take seriously in the report we are voting on today.</p>

      <p sl="de">You cut me off, Mr President, when I called you a despot. I would like to justify why I do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been waiting for this answer since March 2007, in relation to a very, very important matter regarding an error by this Parliament which is serious for me personally and for my political work – when I was assigned to a group against which I have always fought, because I hold them to be Nazis in disguise – and I made a lengthy personal submission to you. In the meantime, I have lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to one-minute speeches, Mr President, you have all your constructions off pat, and when it is supposed to be my turn, you do not allow me to take my turn, so I call you a despot. I also call you a despotic President because you arbitrarily singled out certain Members in the so-called incidents on 12 December, not those who were members of the party you still belonged to at the time, but apparently those who caught your eye.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also call you a despot because you keep on cutting me off while I am speaking and say ‘no, you will not give me that answer’. It is surprising that you are letting me finish speaking now.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, I call you a despotic president because, on the basis of this additional enabling interpretation, and I am not the only one who believes this is untenable, procedures can in fact take place here that truly have no place in a proper Parliament, at least not the way I learned about it in school. However, for me, that is a very long time ago – if you read my curriculum vitae – to make me choose such an expression. A great deal must have taken place for that to happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am, however, convinced that you allow this despotic approach precisely because in fact it was not a matter of seeking clarification on the question of the secretarial assistance allowance. You allowed me to be put in the pillory due to ludicrous errors of form that could happen to anybody – yes anybody, and I am sure they happen to every Member of this House. However, they obscure the fact that, according to internal investigations, at least EUR 80 million would have to be claimed back from Members of Parliament if there were equal treatment and proportionality of funds. These do not exist and therefore I maintain that indeed, in my opinion, you – as the political representative of 14% of Austrian voters – are, unfortunately, a despotic president who is inflicting unnecessary damage on this Parliament and the important underlying idea of Europe. I long to see a true, fair, democratic Parliament, where it would be neither necessary nor desirable to use such an expression.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, new forms of crime and specialised criminal groups of an international nature present an enormous challenge to prosecuting agencies in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Effective prosecution of offenders and the fight against the most alarming manifestations of lawbreaking are not possible without the creation of appropriate tools that the police can use to enforce the law. In the case of a problem such as cross-border crime, the rapid exchange of information between services in individual countries is essential if offenders are to be identified and actions coordinated. DNA databases and digital fingerprint records are a very important tool in the fight against crime. They enable an offender to be identified regardless of where the crime was committed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Dührkop Dührkop report on the stepping up of cooperation between prosecution agencies in combating terrorism and cross-border crime is a valuable initiative that reinforces the action in favour of greater security for US citizens that was initiated in 2005 by the Prüm Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we know, this report calls for an extension of the Prüm Treaty into the fight against cross-border terrorism. We all agree on the need to combat terrorism. That goes without saying. We all agree on the need for cross-border cooperation. However, the Prüm Treaty is about the enforced sharing of data, regardless of concerns over the protection and security of that data. Judging by the newspaper stories on the integrity of police forces in certain Member States, we should all be concerned about that sharing of data.</p>
      <p sl="en">The actual content of the report would in fact significantly breach the civil liberties of citizens right across the EU, because the collection and passing-on of DNA data to other EU Member States becomes obligatory for the first time.</p>

The time taken for matters to be examined at Ombudsman level should be reduced to the bare minimum.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I voted for the report by my fellow Member Mr Adamou on organ donation and transplantation. We need to tackle the problem of the shortage of organs for transplants in Europe, which is the chief factor affecting transplantation programme.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There are some 60 000 patients in need of transplants on waiting lists across Europe. Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15% to 30%. According to a 2006 Eurobarometer poll, 56% of Europeans wish to donate their organs for transplantation purposes after their death. People should be encouraged to speak about organ donation and to communicate their wishes to their relatives. The training of medical experts should also be improved.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Statistics show that up to 81% of citizens of the European Union Member States support the use of a donor card, which makes it easier to identify the donor. In spite of that only 12% of Europeans have this card at present. I support the Commission’s initiative to launch the European Donor Card.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, human life and health constitute the highest value for those responsible for health services in the Member States. All steps aimed at protecting them should meet with the express approval of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Transplantology is one of the most rapidly growing branches of medicine. Thousands of people are given the chance to return to life, the chance, as it were, of a second life. The number of transplants carried out in the European Union in relation to the number of people awaiting them is still inadequate, and many patients awaiting a transplant die before an operation can be performed because of a lack of organs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Action aimed at increasing the number of transplants performed is particularly important. One of the key methods of doing this is to promote transplantology among the public and to encourage potential donors to express their consent to their organs being taken after death. It is also important to set up and monitor an extensive system to control transplants carried out, in order to combat the unpleasant illegal trade in organs, which is not just the province of the poor regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, the Adamou report is an important signal for Member States who are stressing the gravity of the problem.</p>

    <intervention id="2-161" speaker_id="23787" name="Czesław Adam Siekierski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report, as this is an exceptionally important, albeit difficult problem. The declaration of one’s willingness to have one’s organs transferred after death for transplantation into others is a gift of life; it is saving the lives of other people; it is something of exceptional worth to mankind.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be pointed out that there is a link between the shortage of organs and the illegal trade in them. An organ deficiency sometimes prompts people to break the law and acquire organs illegally in order to save a life. This is an ethical and moral problem as well as a legal one.</p>
      <p sl="pl">High requirements in terms of quality and safety in the fields of donation and the taking, testing, storage and transport of organs are not subject to discussion, as they constitute the basis for the success of a transplant.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, we must bear in mind that an effective information policy at EU level must be conducted in order to increase our citizens’ awareness of this subject. The problem in question should be a fundamental challenge for the Member States. Finally, the problem we are discussing today demands appropriate debate, further research, as well as solutions of a moral and ethical nature.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to thank my fellow Members for supporting the European People’s Party proposals concerning Europol and research. We are disappointed that Europol under-estimated the importance of monitoring international human organ trafficking. Even in Europe children vanish because of trade in organs, and not only in China but in Moldova, too, human organs are bought and subsequently sold at a high price to Europeans on the black market. This is of course why Europol must monitor the situation. We cannot prevent international transplant tourism without better coordination of the transplantation programmes across the Union. To achieve this, we must first of all agree on a common approach regarding informed consent for organ donation. I personally believe that experiments in the area of human embryo transfers are unethical and irresponsible. On the other hand, clinical research on adult stem cell produces excellent results in tissue transplantation, for example for heart patients, and this procedure does not violate respect for the uniqueness of human beings. Our report sends a strong signal to the Commission, which will soon proposal for a binding text.</p>

It is a tribute to James that there are people across the European Union who now live because of his generosity.

A transplantation system cannot become an economic category and lead to organs being treated as goods on an internal market.

I recognise that a lot of work has been going on within the Commission to try and sort out its own accounts.

There is still to this day a culture of ‘let’s keep our heads down and not report wrongdoings’ in the European Commission.

To think that the majority of this Parliament has just voted that members cannot employ their spouse, but can employ their lover, mistress or toy boy. Personally I have none of these, but I would still like to point out how absurd it is.</p>

Apart from the fact that it is absurd for a report on 2006 to demand the presentation of accounts for 2007, I can reassure the authors. The update for 2007 has been done, but it will first be presented to the board of directors of the fund, which is a Luxembourg non-profit organisation.

      <p sl="en">I think, as Members, we should all be as open and transparent as we possibly can. The best way to have dealt with the report would have been to put it in the public domain, because then people would have realised that it is not millions of pounds that are at issue, but a very small amount of money – still worth chasing and policing, and giving the Members that abuse the system a great deal of hassle and taking them to the courts over, but not as bad as the general public now think this whole place is.</p>

There are now so many agencies that not all of us know what they are and what they do. In fact, I am surprised that anybody in the House, apart from those who sat on the appropriate committee, knew what the GNSS Supervisory Authority does, or even what its budget was. I have great concerns that some of these agencies that we have voted to discharge the accounts for do not actually have any legal basis until the Lisbon Treaty is passed by all Member States. I wonder where the legal basis of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights comes from, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are now passing accounts for agencies that do not have a legal basis in this place, and no one particularly cares. I find that quite upsetting.

The second objective remains the protection of fundamental rights on which Europe is built.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The adoption by all Member States of the Prüm Treaty proposed in 2007 by Germany forms part of the much needed improvement of police cooperation within the EU.

Consequently, these issues should be handled in a very sensitive manner. We need to reconsider Amendment 3 to the draft Council decision, which states that special categories of data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical belief, party or trade union membership, sexual orientation or health should be processed only if absolutely necessary and in proportion to the purpose of the specific case and in compliance with specific safeguards. I see this as potentially seriously flawed. Who will decide what is necessary and in proportion and how will they reach that decision? Will it be some kind of ‘Big Brother’? Or an anonymous police officer for whom protection of human rights may be a very minor issue? How is health or sexual orientation relevant to combating terrorism?

The potential to develop such activities is of particular importance in countries where an active civil society runs up against persecution from elites who are exercising power. I supported Mrs Harkin’s report because I agree that the European Commission should promote cross-border projects in the sphere of voluntary work where our nearest neighbour, Belarus, is concerned.

      <p sl="en">There can be no doubt that what is known as ‘volunteering’ fulfils a very important social role as a contribution to finding answers to citizens’ problems and needs, namely by promoting effective solidarity and mutual assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason we disagree with the idea of ‘volunteering’ as a matter of ‘significant savings for public services’. On the contrary, we consider that the more States improve the public services offered and guaranteed to their citizens, the more important the role of volunteering will be.</p>
      <p sl="en">As is mentioned, it is vital to ensure that ‘voluntary activity is additional to public services and not a replacement of them’. ‘Volunteering’ cannot be used as a pretext or a means of encouraging States to neglect their responsibilities, specifically their social duties, by handing them over to pseudo-charitable organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is with this backdrop in mind that we are fighting for the need for effective and adequate support for non-profit organisations, among many others, the cooperative movement, local bodies and companies, residents’ committees and sports, recreational, cultural, youth or children’s associations.</p>

The contribution made by the voluntary sector to promoting intercultural dialogue and social integration and to rebuilding social trust and reintegrating those previously excluded from society is also invaluable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw your attention to what, in my opinion, is the very significant economic aspect of voluntary work. Volunteering is an excellent opportunity to acquire new abilities and skills, thus improving one’s chances in the employment market and enabling a smooth transition to be made from study to occupational activities, which is invaluable to young people in particular. Moreover, as the report’s author remarks, voluntary work plays a significant part in shaping gross domestic product, which should not be overlooked.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In the Youth in Action Programme, the European Union has launched the European Voluntary Service. It gives young people the possibility to undergo training courses in various professions or to work with non-governmental organizations in another Member State.

This is an amount that does not exceed 42 million euros every year, an amount that should finance the travel costs of a few tens of thousands of European volunteers, as well as the minimum related expenses. The interest of young people is very high and there are many organizations that want to implement this programme. In Romania only, a new Member State, there are over 60 organizations accredited for the exchange of volunteers and over 5,000 applications for this training course.</p>

The reasons for this include a shorter period of community service in lieu of military service, families relocating and pressure at work or school. For example, as a result of staff shortages voluntary fire service members are not being allowed to leave their workplace, even if the country reimburses their employer for their wages. Companies need a strong message that they also benefit from voluntary labour and we must make best-practice comparisons as to how voluntary activity can continue to be made attractive, so that we can achieve our goals.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Voluntary work does not receive the support and attention it deserves in the European Union. This is why I voted in favour of the report by the rapporteur, Mrs Marian Harkin, on the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion. I agree with the rapporteur that the European institutions must set up a flexible and non-bureaucratic support system.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Voluntary work must not be underestimated since it represents an important part of democratic life in Europe and involves more than 100 million Europeans of different ages, faiths and nationalities. It reflects the huge determination of individuals and strengthens the bond between citizens and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Volunteering has a long-standing tradition in the countries of Western Europe and in the US. In contrast, non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations in post-communist countries introduced voluntary activities only after the democracies had been installed. The World Organisation of the Scout Movement was completely banned by the totalitarian communist regime. At present, its activities are attracting more and more enthusiasts into its ranks: people of different ages and from different parts of the EU. Today we cannot imagine an event without the presence of church and charity organisations, without the presence of the Red Cross. Volunteers also help to invigorate and mobilise citizens from disadvantaged communities, for example in the European Volunteer Centre and in the European Youth Forum, as regards the principle of civil society, through development and by reviving and promoting traditions, originality and diversity of the regions.</p>

      <p sl="en">The clarifications included in the report seem important to me and the measures suggested for shedding light on the existing data on this type of activity are necessary as this is an unpaid activity, which thus needs to be clearly differentiated from the activities of non-governmental organisations. The added value of these voluntary activities is very important for our societies, and it is therefore legitimate to recognise and distinguish it. However, we should not take advantage of its altruistic nature to replace the efforts that societies, responsible authorities or the private sector should make to boost the opportunities offered at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The various Community funds are designed to stimulate the European economy and foster, socio-economic cohesion and growth and sustainable development of European societies. Voluntary activity is a bonus that we, as citizens, offer others.

Small organisations that carry out very useful activities at local and regional level need special help to draw up applications.

We have to protect Community programmes from being abused but caution and prevention must not make them less accessible to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Secondly, based on my personal experience as a member of the board of the Forum for Life, I can testify that volunteering contributes to social cohesion by creating human capital, regardless of the volunteer’s age. In the Forum for Life young people learn responsibility and generosity and gain experience in building interpersonal relationships. Human capital is volunteering’s greatest contribution to social cohesion. Therefore, the Member States and the regions are asked to apply this unsurpassed form of investment in our future.</p>

The men and women who devote their time to voluntary work while coping with changes in the labour market and in the importance of intergenerational solidarity in families and society must receive official recognition.

      <p sl="en">I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget for the financial year 2006, based on the report by Mr Lundgren recommending that the European Parliament should grant discharge to the Secretary-General of the Council. I regret that, unlike other institutions, the Council does not publish an annual activity report, citing the Gentlemen’s Agreement of 1970. However, it seems essential to do so in order for the Council be more accountable to European citizens. Under this Gentlemen’s Agreement, the Council undertakes to make no amendments to the estimate of expenditure of the European Parliament. This undertaking is only binding in so far as this estimate of expenditure does not conflict with Community provisions, in particular with regard to the Staff Regulations of Officials and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, and to the seat of the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), I support the call for maximum transparency and to make sure that, in accordance with point 42 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, no operating CFSP expenditure should appear in the Council's budget. Nevertheless, I believe that the Council should have a discretionary budget for the CFSP.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of discharge for the Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2006 on the basis of the report by my Austrian colleague Mr Hans-Peter Martin, which recommends to Parliament to give discharge. The discharge procedure should be simplified and streamlined for the decentralised agencies, which are growing in number (from 8 in 2000, to 20 in 2006) and represent a total budget of around EUR 1 billion. I support the request for the Commission to present a study every five years on the added value of each agency and not to hesitate to close an agency if the analysis concludes that it is not useful. The internal audit procedures of the agencies also need urgent improvement and I support the possibility of having a common disciplinary board for all the agencies. I cannot understand the concerns of the board of the European Medicines Agency that the new tasks being allocated to it are not sufficiently funded. Indeed, the Agency’s financial situation appears to be flourishing, with a low level of use of funds (less than 60%) and considerable accounting surpluses associated with accumulations, and at the same time a subsidy from the Community and fees paid by the undertakings to maintain Community marketing authorisations for medicines (in other words revenue of EUR 119 million in 2006 plus a Community subsidy of EUR 31 million).</p>

      <p sl="en">Among other possible pertinent considerations on the discharge of this Agency’s budget, one should point out the considerable sums left over at the end of 2006, and what is more, that two amending budgets were approved in that same year, the objective being to increase its budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">After these amending budgets, this Agency’s budget increased to EUR 19.2 million. Yet at the end of 2006, and based on the Agency’s own accounts, it held EUR 14.3 million in cash!</p>

      <p sl="en">Such is the political desire to make progress with the communitarisation of “border management” at EU level and to set up Frontex – which we obviously oppose – that financial resources have been provided over and above the proven capacity.

This would include, for example, limiting ourselves to one location for Parliament, as well as more sensible use of funds by EU agencies.

    <intervention id="2-245" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic rise in food prices since the start of the year has triggered a worldwide awareness of the global food crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a few hours’ time, a meeting is scheduled to start in London which will bring together the main parties involved in food aid. At the beginning of May, an international conference will be held on the subject of ‘Towards a green revolution in Africa’. All political players, operators and experts in this sector have now been mobilised. For several years now the world has seen a steady increase in food prices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since 2000, the dollar price of wheat has tripled, and rice and maize prices have doubled. The start of 2008 brought a further 20% increase, which has, in our industrialised countries, resulted in worries over purchasing power and in developing countries in the risk of famine for entire populations. When you live on less than a dollar a day and you spend most of your income on food, these increases are quite simply untenable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is at the root of the food protests that have taken place in recent weeks all over the world: in Haiti, Mexico, Egypt, Morocco, Cameroon, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia. Studies show that the era of cheap food on the international market is over. We will not see food prices returning to their former levels, and volatility could increase if measures are not taken swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current climate of rocketing food prices is a serious threat in terms of political, financial and social destabilisation in many countries around the world, so we must react quickly. It goes far beyond the capacity of the European Commission, or even of the European Union. The entire international community must act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking at the possible solutions, we have identified two key options. Firstly, we need to save lives and respond to the social crises created by the soaring prices, sometimes exacerbated by the national political situation. Secondly, we evidently need a medium and long term strategy. I believe that we need to act on both fronts. Clearly the biggest mistake would be to offer a humanitarian response to a structural problem such as food security in the form of food aid. Doubtless this would ease some people’s consciences in the short term, but emergency food aid is not enough to tackle a structural problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the short term therefore, it is clearly necessary, along with national responses aimed at ensuring better control of food prices, to meet the needs of the most vulnerable populations who are in real humanitarian distress. This is why we must mobilise additional emergency humanitarian aid to increase the capacity of ECHO to deliver emergency food aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this is no ordinary food crisis. This is a purchasing power crisis, which hits the most destitute who can no longer afford to buy food. Therefore, our response must also be based on other forms of food aid, designed, for example, to offset the negative effects on infant malnutrition and to support the purchasing power of the most vulnerable households. We must also promote the rapid growth of local agricultural supply, thus giving local farmers access to agricultural inputs, seeds and fertilisers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of the scale of the crisis and its probable duration, it is absolutely crucial that the European Union also engages in a medium-term approach, supporting social protection policies in the countries most at risk, particularly in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the medium and long term, the only valid response is that we do everything we can to ensure agricultural supply. Production must increase globally to keep pace with international demand, although this must not be left to the main exporting countries. The European Union has already taken concrete measures in this regard. Set-aside has been frozen, milk quotas have been increased and customs duty on cereals has been abolished.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Africa must play its part, with our support, and instigate a green revolution so that it can reduce its overall dependency on the international market. African agriculture is currently the least productive in the world, but it offers enormous potential for development, provided that policies in favour of domestic smallholdings are maintained and priority is given to investments, to boosting productivity and to facilitating access for farmers to national and regional markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is already making this approach a key priority. We were the first to highlight the importance of agriculture in development policies, long before other international players did so. We have reviewed our own programmes based on those of the African Union, proposing to align European aid for agriculture and rural development with the African Union’s agricultural development programme unveiled in June 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the programming of the 10th European Development Fund, we made sure that the rural development sector as a whole would see a twofold increase in aid – EUR 650 million for the 9th EDF, EUR 1 250 billion for the 10th EDF. This has not been easy, since, as you know, it is up to the development partners to choose the sectors in which aid is to be concentrated. This is a significant increase, a 100% rise in absolute terms, although it does not translate as a percentage increase in the amount set aside for agriculture and rural development. The amount of money available has doubled, but the percentage of the European Development Fund remains more or less the same.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, we note with satisfaction the renewed interest of the donor community in the agricultural sector, which has been ignored over the last 25 years. The Commission as a whole, and I in particular, as Commissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid, are only too aware of the political importance of the current crisis. I had the chance to speak to the Secretary-General of the United Nations about this at the last meeting of the Africa MDG Steering Group in New York last month. I also discussed it with the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr Ping. It was during this meeting that I used the expression ‘humanitarian tsunami’, because I felt that it was necessary to shock political leaders into action, rather than simply talking and making promises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The causes of the crisis are varied and complex, although we must take care not to get lost in the finer details. There is increased demand, particularly in Asia, due to the improved living standards of many people who can now afford to eat more and to eat better. There is also the increase in oil prices, which has a direct impact on the cost of transport and fertilisers. Add to this the problems on the supply side caused by the impact of climate change, and we have some of the ingredients for the current crisis right there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the Commission doing? It is working on a long term strategy, which as I said earlier is crucial. However, it will be two years before we see the results on the ground. Increasing agricultural production is not simply a question of turning on a tap, so we are also looking at the short term and at emergency aid. Last March, we decided on a further EUR 160 million in food aid; we have just decided to release an additional EUR 57 million, budgeted for 2008 but which will be made available much earlier in the year. We will be mobilising EUR 60 million of fresh money, which will either come from a rejigging of Heading 4, or from a request made to Parliament to mobilise the emergency reserve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission will continue to monitor this situation very closely and is ready, as needs develop, to consider additional funding if necessary.</p>

    <intervention id="2-246" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Lenarčič" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="sl">First of all I would like to apologise to Members for my late arrival. I have just been at a meeting with the Conference of Committee Chairman and I am grateful to you for having arranged the debate so as to enable me to speak now.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European Union is very concerned about the increase in the prices of agricultural produce, which is becoming a problem not just in the European Union but elsewhere in the world as well. We are aware of the seriousness and scale of the potential consequences, in particular for the poorest countries of the world.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Where do the reasons for this lie? On the supply side, the price rise is mainly due to a shortfall in yields, partly as a result of the impact of climate change, particularly in the case of cereals, and higher production costs. On the other hand, world population growth and the rapid development of a number of major countries, such as China, India and Brazil, is increasing demand. Increased purchasing power and higher living standards in these countries are leading to changes in dietary habits. The increase in demand for meat and dairy products is having an indirect effect on prices for feed grain.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Some, or rather many, people are also citing as a reason the expanding biofuels market and the concomitant demand for agricultural products for non-food purposes. It is precisely for this reason that we in the European Union are making efforts, through the working groups established specifically for that purpose, to draw up clear sustainability criteria, which will facilitate the sustainable production of biofuels with a minimum impact on factors such as food prices.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since, on both the supply and demand sides, the reasons cited for higher food prices are structural in nature, prices and price increases can be expected, in the long term as well, to remain at a level higher than that to which we have become accustomed in the past decade. Globally, the rise in food prices is having a particularly harmful impact on countries where agricultural produce and food account for a significant proportion of imports. This issue is particularly acute in countries with low and medium gross domestic products and less competitive structures in terms of the production of and trade in food.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In order to ensure basic food supplies, it is necessary, among other things, to encourage agricultural production in poorer countries. At the same time, wealthier countries should be encouraged to allocate funds for development aid to the poorest countries and to become more actively involved in humanitarian organisations.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European Union is seeking to curb rising food prices in various ways. The purpose of the recent reforms of the common agricultural policy was to make European agriculture more sustainable and market-oriented. The European Union has already adopted the set-aside requirement for 2008 and thereby increased the volume of arable land given over to food production in the European Union. The final abolition of this obligation and the withdrawal of energy crop premiums were also proposed as part of the review of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Efforts to promote research paving the way for the production of second-generation biofuels are also important. By-products, such as straw, parings and waste in general, would be used in their production.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In addition, as part of the World Trade Organisation negotiations, the EU is willing to remove export subsidies by 2013. In any event, the issue of the instability of agricultural markets is becoming one of the main challenges facing European Union agriculture and agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In view of the scale of the possible consequences, the European Union Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the issue of high prices at its meeting in April. It is most likely that it will discuss this further at future meetings and ministers will also address the problem in other Council formations.</p>
      <p sl="sl">International organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Food Programme, and other agencies, are also making active efforts to curb the rise in food prices. The Slovenian Presidency will take part in the international Conference on World Food Security and the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy to be held at the beginning of June in Rome under the auspices of the FAO.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In conclusion, the rise in food prices is a global problem and therefore needs to be addressed with due consideration and with intensified efforts in all related areas. Our aim is to restore market price stability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I welcome your report. You are absolutely right, particularly when it comes to Africa. The PPE-DE Group is extremely concerned by the food shortage which affects numerous poor countries around the world, but also by the significant increase in the cost of the consumer’s shopping basket in Europe. We do not hear enough about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, the food crisis calls for emergency measures to help starving populations. In this respect, I welcome the release of funds to the World Food Programme. However, these measures, as positive as they are, will only bring temporary relief to the problem. In reality, it is the world’s agriculture which must undergo root-and-branch structural reform. The food crisis is a chance to have an in-depth discussion the desired position of food and agriculture in the world economy and in the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, Europe is aware that, more than ever, it needs agriculture to guarantee its food security. To meet the increased demand of emerging economies, we need to encourage the agricultural development of those countries. The major challenge for poor countries is food self-sufficiency, so we must help them establish agriculture which is economically viable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The freeze on production in Europe is no longer appropriate, as you pointed out. In terms of the number of days of consumption, the EU’s cereal reserve has halved since 2005, and in a crisis would only last a month. Imports would not be enough, since many third countries tend to keep their production for the domestic market. They are right to do so. Commodities have become the subject of speculation. A tonne of wheat might be resold several times before it gets to the mill.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many people think that agrofuels are to blame for the current food crisis. This is far from being the case. They represent only 2% of current agricultural production in Europe. What I would like to say is that I do not want to defend the lobby in favour of agrochemicals, but we should not give up straightaway. We should hang on to this 2%, so that Europe is also involved in the development of agrochemicals for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to turn to plant varieties that are resistant to the new challenges presented by climate change and the increasing shortage of water resources. To do this, we must invest in agricultural research and reflect realistically and responsibly, and I mean properly reflect, on the issue of GM crops. Let us open our eyes. The Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy is the ideal time to launch a real debate on Europe’s agricultural and food policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Remember the old US policy? Two sacrosanct policies that no one could touch, defence and food security; that is what Congress told us. We should stop advocating simplistic and purely economic solutions which do not provide long-term solutions to the current crisis. Let us also recognise that the answer to the food problem can only be global. Europe must find solutions in collaboration with international organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF and, of course, the WTO. We must find a way of limiting the harmful effects of financial speculation while populations are hit by famine. Some countries have significant reserves which they continue to restrict to export. Speculators are gambling with the lives of entire populations. We must do everything to quash these phenomena and to facilitate trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there needs to be an inquiry into why the price increase is so high, when agricultural commodities only represent a very small percentage of the total price of processed food. Responsibilities are not yet clearly defined, and it would seem that not everyone is doing badly out of the food crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, we have to take things in hand, we have to carry out the various studies needed so that no one can profit at the expense of the world’s poorest or Europe’s most disadvantaged citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="2-248" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group requested this debate because we believe that action is urgently required. Commissioner Michel made some pertinent and good remarks about what the Commission can do straight away. However, we also requested this debate because we want to discuss the basic principles behind the way food prices are developing, and the consequences of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many explanatory factors. The world’s population is increasing, the amount of land available for cultivation is limited, the standard of living – and with it the ability to purchase and consume food – is rising in many parts of the world. In itself, that is a positive development. Consumption of meat in China, for example, is increasing rapidly. However, this decreases the amount available worldwide. The increase in energy prices and political goals – including our political goals in relation to climate, for example the fact that production of biofuels is becoming more attractive – all bring the results that Mr Daul has just described.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are all explanatory models that we are all familiar with. However, there is one point I would like to deal with that I feel is not mentioned frequently enough. My fellow Members will go into the various points that I have just described in more detail in their remarks, but I want to introduce one point into our deliberations that we do not talk about at all and which I believe is essential in the crisis, and that is that the major mutual funds that have taken possession of all levels of economic life and move hundreds of billions of dollars around the world every day – these mutual funds, the hedge funds, have taken control of the food sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not mean to criticise the people who have been trading internationally in commodities for the last 140 years. That is completely normal, but what is happening now is no longer normal, and that is that enormous sums are being wagered on increases in food prices and huge gambling is going on. This means that the banks in Europe are advising their clients: ‘make the most of increasing food prices so that you can make a profit on your investments’. By implication, this means ‘create a food shortage so that prices will rise and you can make a profit’. Ladies and gentlemen, that is nothing less than watching ‘casino capitalism’, which is a concern for us at all levels, drawing up its chair at the tables of the world’s poor. That is the real moral scandal behind this crisis and that is why we want to discuss it in this forum.</p>
      <p sl="de">More than ever, this crisis provides good grounds for the necessity for international control of the financial markets. I can live with enormous profits being made within a few seconds in any area, in gold trading, if you like, but not when it comes to feeding large proportions of the world’s population. That is immorality taken to the extreme and that should not be underestimated in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point we must discuss the immediate consequences this has for us. What repercussions does it have for the reform of the agricultural commodity market policy here in Europe? What role does our own export subsidy policy play? Are we, with our exporters, contributing to food shortages because agriculture in the affected regions of this world cannot develop sufficiently on its own? What is our answer to the question of greater availability of bioenergy? Must this automatically be accompanied by shortages and limited production of food? Or will there, in the next generation, be technological developments in the area of biochemistry – and Mr Daul is right here – that could bring us to the point where we no longer needed to use only land that has been used until now to produce food?</p>
      <p sl="de">We must consider all these questions, but they must not distract us from one thing, and that is that we cannot allow a financial system that is coming apart at the seams to exacerbate hunger in this world, just so that a few capitalists can make even greater profits.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Michel spoke for the Commission but in the place of the Council. He has considerable experience of both institutions, fortunately, which is to our benefit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the past year has seen startling hikes in the cost of basic foods, such that 100 million people are being pushed into poverty and hundreds of thousands put at risk of starvation. So grave is the threat that it will cancel out all progress towards the goal of halving world poverty by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe’s rise in living standards has been rapid, so rapid that even my generation remembers, on our continent, gardens where little grew except the appetites of young children. We must not stand idly by in our privileged position as disaster unfolds. We must give more money to the World Food Programme now, so that it can feed the destitute, and my group welcomes the Commissioner’s commitments in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many lay the blame on biofuels. Indeed, the United Nations special rapporteur has called agrofuels a ‘crime against humanity’. Yet the reasons for the recent food price rises are many and varied, and so must be the international community’s response.</p>
      <p sl="fr">World population growth, poor growing conditions linked to climate change, loss of agricultural land to industrial use, immoral commodities speculation and changing eating habits have all contributed to the current crisis. Meat consumption in China, for example, has risen from 20 kg per capita in 1980 to 50 kg per capita in 2007, and if every kilogram of beef requires 2 000 square feet of land and 13 000 litres of water, while the same nutritional content can be found from soya at 1% of the land and water use, we begin to see the complexity of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Far and away the worst offender is market distortion, which traps poor farmers in a cycle of poverty and gives them little incentive to increase food production. The high standards of sustainability for sourcing and manufacture, written into the European Union’s biofuels proposals, effectively insure Europe against non-sustainable use. So, rather than using biofuels as a scapegoat, we must move to end agricultural protectionism and export restrictions; we must move to enhance agricultural development in the poorest countries and to ensure the success of the Doha Development Round to encourage free, fair and sustainable farm trade at global level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is the common agricultural policy, not European biofuels, that are the root cause of this problem, and it is CAP reform, not dropping biofuels targets, that will solve it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also use our collective weight to ensure that climate change and sustainability criteria are integrated with trade policy. The truth is we can afford to feed the world and, as Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said, ‘global cooperation can deliver the macroeconomic framework and the incentives needed to address the problem’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group believes that with the right political will and the right international cooperation, globalisation can be the solution, not the problem. It is up to the European Union to lead the way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, just to say I am not going to go over the reasons why we are where we are; the reason the world is suffering or going to suffer from huge food shortages has been well documented here by many people. But it is in many ways going to challenge us in trying to eradicate world hunger by 2015. I think that an enormous challenge lies ahead of us here at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a global problem and it is going to need a global response. We have tackled other problems, and we have tried to tackle other problems like global warming at that level. I believe that the only way we can tackle this problem is through a global response.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has already been said, there are many reasons – increased population – and, yes, I think it is important that we increase aid immediately. But we have got to look at a more long-term solution, to try and find out exactly why the food market has ended up like this. As I said, many reasons have already been outlined, but I think we have to look for a long-term solution, and I believe that in this Chamber we have the political will.</p>
      <p sl="en">The one group we should encourage to do more about this is the United Nations. It should convene a conference on the situation at the moment, and we should support it in any way we can. That is the only way to try and do this, because people are saying the cause is perhaps hedge funds, or people speculating, or drought or whatever the case may be, but I think we are going to have to pool all our resources and all our political will globally to try and tackle this problem in the years ahead, because it is a very serious problem, especially for poor people living around the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the years and decades that now lie behind us, we had a disastrously low price for agricultural products and it was essential, and urgent, for it to increase worldwide. This is a very good development because the price level was below the production costs for organic/rural agriculture, and that has destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of farmers, not only in the third world but also here in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If, as Mr Schulz says, this is being fuelled by speculation, then that has something to do with the fact that now, after the European Union did away with export subsidies and allowed premiums to run down, we have something more like an intervention mechanism, where food and feedstuff are linked to the price of oil, because we are starting to make petrol from food and feedstuff. This promotes speculation because, all around the world, the possibility and necessity of transporting feedstuff is increasing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is the world’s largest importer of food and feedstuff, which means that we have no surpluses and that the mechanism by which we convert the imports – which amount to 50 million tonnes of grain units, bought almost below the poverty threshold from third world countries – into food, which is then dumped and exported at a cost of billions and undersold on regional markets in third world countries, has ultimately destroyed rural agriculture and regional subsistence farming.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we must see this as an opportunity. This does not mean that I believe that agrifuels are the panacea, because the energy balance is negative and because that gives rise to speculation, but we must try to convert material which is actually available, as waste, into energy. To put it more bluntly, we must make gold from shit rather than thinking that we are competing with food for humans. It is not possible for everyone in the world to have full gas tanks and full plates based only on the plants that grow. It might be possible in Europe, because we are rich enough to purchase these products and these crop harvests for ourselves, but the rest of the world would go hungry.</p>
      <p sl="de">In closing I would like to add one further thought: We have 850 million people who are starving, and these 850 million people were already starving when the price level was disastrously low. What has now happened is that the purchasing power of the middle classes in third world countries has decreased so that these people are finding it difficult to buy other consumer goods. This thwarts the strategy of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Now people are calling for more money, but the 850 million starving people were already in need of that money.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food is a right and should not therefore be subject solely to market rules or financial speculation. We are witnessing a crisis and protests that recall our riots for bread, people being killed because they are hungry.</p>
      <p sl="it">The causes are many and they have already been mentioned: the rise in the price of oil, subsidies for the production of biofuels, bad weather, the increase in meat consumption, futures speculation on foods. What are our responsibilities? Mr Ziegler sums up the problem when he says that globalisation is monopolising the Earth’s riches. The multinationals are responsible for structural violence; they have built a world of inequality and horror. We need to end all this, he says. Will we listen to him?</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition to the WTO rules, the European Union has opted for a common agricultural policy of subsidies that, although it once seemed inadequate, now appears rather destructive of international equilibrium. The application of quotas to our cereal production, along with set-aside measures, is also responsible for the situation we are facing today.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us watch out for the easy appeal of a pro-GMO lobby that promises to rid the world of famine, but which is an ephemeral shortcut that instead would cause enormous damage. British law has been described as madness because, although perhaps less polluting, it certainly does include biofuel quotas that do not prevent the destruction of natural habitats.</p>
      <p sl="it">Among the possible actions, I would support Mr Ziegler’s suggestion of a five-year moratorium on the production of biofuels. We need to keep the promise we made to halve the number of people who die of hunger by 2015, and Louis Michel is right: increasing finance for the World Food Programme, even if it is our duty, is not the solution, and we welcome the emergency package and USD 10 million contributed for Haiti.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the finance that has already been announced for African agriculture, I am delighted to hear Louis Michel, if I have understood him correctly, say that it will go to smaller producers and therefore to help subsistence farming, which contributes to overcoming the crisis particularly for the poorest, and not to multinationals dedicated to exporting, which would actually make countries even poorer and more dependent on imports.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU has decided that we can now grow fuel and is telling countries in the developing world that, instead of growing food, they should grow fuel so that the EU can continue to run its limousines. Since I became an MEP, it is hard to remember any issue which has provoked such a deluge of letters as the subject of biofuels. I have received over a hundred requests to vote against the Commission’s renewable energy target.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have not needed much persuading because as a UKIP MEP I vote against any imposition of EU targets on my country anyway. However, on this occasion, I am happy to vote against it because the dash to biofuels, an essential part of the Commission’s strategy, is a key factor in the surge in food prices around the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">British Government adviser Professor John Beddington has said that there are real problems with the unsustainability of biofuels. He is right. We have become so obsessed with global warming that we have overlooked the real elephant in the room – the global food crisis. For farmers in places like Africa there is now less land available for growing food because many people are growing fuel instead. It is also leading to the destruction of rainforests with devastating effects. So less land for food equals less food but an increase in the supply of people, which inevitably means an increase in food prices. Across the world, and in Europe in particular, food prices have been rising far more quickly than inflation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU prides itself on taking the lead in environmental matters. Will it therefore take the lead in recognising that biofuels are not the answer? Biofuels are pushing up prices in shopping baskets around the world. We in the West will groan, grin and bear it; in the developing world, it is a matter of life or death. The EU has never been a friend to the developing world. Giant factory ships have emptied the west African seas of fish. Dumping of subsidised agricultural surplus has devastated the profit margins of many of their farmers and now, while their populations are increasing, their land, rather than providing food for their own people, is being used to keep our cars on the road.</p>
      <p sl="de">Already there have been violent food riots across the world as desperate hungry people attack grain silos and supermarkets. In some countries troops are on the streets to protect what is left of the food. The risk of armed conflict between and within states is greatly increased by the EU’s policies – so much for the EU keeping the peace. What is more useful to a villager in Africa? A full petrol tank or a full stomach? Please listen to common sense and reverse your policy on biofuels immediately.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Rising food prices are caused by the present volatility of the agricultural markets, which are naturally unstable in any case. The main task of the agricultural policies has therefore always been, and still is, to eliminate this instability.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should remember the biblical story of the seven fat cows and seven thin cows: thousands of years ago society was already capable of organising agricultural markets and thereby preventing fluctuations of these markets and giving Egypt the conditions for prosperity, while other societies suffered famine and wars because of the lack of food.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Over the course of its history, mankind has to a large extent developed in line with each society’s ability to accept the priority of agricultural policies. However, the current struggles we are witnessing in the WTO, focusing on military and control policies or on national commercial and economic interests, unfortunately confirm that the today’s agricultural policies have entirely different priorities.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ensuring the stability of the agricultural markets must therefore become a priority for the WTO if any national policies, including our common agricultural policy, are to make sense. Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, we are flogging a dead horse and will continue doing so until a global food crisis makes us adopt radical measures, which will of course be to the detriment of farmers and the public but to the benefit of speculators. Therefore, the most important thing is to have enough courage to grab the bull by its horns.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think this is one of the most important debates we have had in this Parliament in my time here. However, I would ask everyone to suspend their hang-ups, misconceptions and perhaps their conceptions, because kicking around the CAP – beating ourselves up about where we are at – will not solve this problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nobody thought we would be here – none of the experts in the Commission predicted that food security would be a problem, none of the great political leaders ever spoke about it – but suddenly Europeans are paying more for food and they are terrified. Well, maybe it is a good day that we are at this stage because maybe, in this knowledge, we will take real account of the needs of the world’s poorest of the poor, who are paying through the nose for food at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to make a few suggestions, starting at European level, which might frighten some who have already spoken. While commodity prices are increasing, can I just ask you to reflect that so, too, are the costs of production. Farmers use fuel and energy to grow food and their costs are going up. Farmers will only increase production if they make a profit, and we have a real problem here. Look at fertiliser prices and the trends in that direction. Climate change – we have actually pulled back on food production in Europe because of it. We cannot have it both ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let me go to the developing world. I have on other occasions – not on this platform but elsewhere – said that Africa needs a common agricultural policy. That is how Europe developed its food production base – that is how we fed ourselves – and we need to acknowledge, as has been done in this House today, that we have underinvested in agricultural research, in development and in the advisory service.</p>
      <p sl="en">I repeat my point: it is a good day if high food prices in Europe make us realise that we need to invest in the very basics of civilisation, which is food production, and we need firstly to look after the developing world. So, while I come here anxious about the state we are in, I come here too in hope that finally we might actually do something and take seriously the question of global food security. But do not kick the CAP!</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-257" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a number of objective factors contribute to or cause the rise in prices. There is also speculation, as Mr Schulz has explained in detail. Does all this mean that we are helpless, that all we can do is sit and watch? I do not believe so. The Commissioner and representatives of the Council Presidency have mentioned certain points. I would now ask you, Commissioner, together with your Commission colleagues, to draw up a comprehensive plan over the coming weeks as to what answers we can provide, as citizens – both globally and in Europe – want an answer to the question of what we can do and what we cannot do.</p>
      <p sl="de">One point is the development of thriving, sustainable agriculture. This is a vital aspect. I do not want to repeat what has already been said, simply to make a brief additional comment: We were recently in Kosovo, where there are many areas of land where we as the European Union are, however, not doing anything to enable the simple people there to develop appropriate agriculture. We must do more in our own region therefore – in the Balkans, Ukraine and in other countries – to promote the development of sustainable agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: we cannot simply say ‘well, prices are rising, and that is all there is to it’ because we know who is worst affected. We know that the poorer people are, the greater the proportion of their income they have to spend on food, and that they are more seriously affected. Therefore we must give clear signals on distribution and social welfare awareness so that when there are wage increases, and especially pension increases, these support in particular lower income groups here in Europe. Of course, we must also support those on low incomes throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also point out that although there is social unrest, the response to famine and shortages is, of course, much better in democratic countries. The development of democracy, in all our countries but particularly in the third world, is an important aspect of counteracting these privations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly – as has already been mentioned – the effects of speculation. Does this mean then, that we cannot do anything? Could Europe, perhaps within the framework of the UNDP, the World Bank, etc. not be proactive so that, by appropriately warehousing and releasing stores, we could at least partially lessen the effects of speculation? We cannot say ‘oh well, that is just how speculation works,’ but we must see what we can do in this area. Perhaps the same applies to oil and gas; there is work to be done there too.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as our energy policy goals are concerned, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is absolutely true that there are exaggerated expectations, particularly as regards the first couple of technologies that were developed. However, this is exactly where we must conduct more energy research, leading towards a second or third technology – I agree wholeheartedly – and especially the use of biomass and other raw materials that do not have the harmful displacement effect that is currently the case. Here, too, the Commission must join with us in reflecting on this, and not abandon the goals but rather adapt them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally I will restate my clear, firm message: let us help the poorest of the poor – worldwide, but also in Europe – to access healthier food despite this difficult situation. That is our important social-democratic goal.</p>

    <intervention id="2-258" speaker_id="4338" name="Thierry Cornillet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, other speakers here today have debated the subject at length, but it is better to repeat ourselves than to contradict each other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When you have a dollar a day to live on and it costs 75 cents to feed yourself, and then this increases by 40%, you have nowhere to go. You cannot redistribute your costs, so you reduce your food ration, you stop sending your children to school because it costs money and your main priority is to feed them, and then you get all the attendant social problems that come with this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are seeing is the human problem on an individual scale. The causes have mostly been covered. I think we should refrain from having an ideological interpretation of these causes, because there is not just one interpretation. Obviously biofuels might be one cause but, as Mr Daul said, this represents 2% of production, 1% of surface area, so we should stop overstating this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Climate change is not necessarily harmful everywhere, even though the consequences are disastrous in some countries. As for the change in eating habits, I believe that the fact that some of the world’s population are eating better is rather good news. As for speculation, yes of course we should find a way to stop western capitalists from making money that should be going to rice growers in Vietnam.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The money issue will be resolved. We will of course find the EUR 315 million to be added to the EUR 2.9 billion of the World Food Programme. However, the real solution, as the Commissioner said in his report, the solution lies with production issues. We must improve agriculture, improve productivity, especially in Africa, which of course requires investment into hybrid research, and we should stop demonising GMOs, which can be part of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to invest in training. It was Mr Dumont who said ‘give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’. I think that applies here too. Above all, we need to invest in infrastructure, because improving agriculture means improving irrigation, improving transport, making it possible for produce to sent from point A to be sold at point B, and we need to improve storage and the cold chain, if we want to export this produce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone needs to act, not just humanitarian resources. All aid measures – the IMF, World Bank, ADB, etc. – must be mobilised in order to put agriculture back at the heart of development strategy. It is also an opportunity for us to rethink food security in humanitarian aid. Let us be humble enough to admit that years of humanitarian aid have not reduced dependency. We need to ask questions about humanitarian aid to ease our consciences. This is not the time for ideological interpretation. Let us examine the external causes, population density, natural disasters, the loss of human life through HIV and AIDS and, more importantly, the links between poor governance and the humanitarian consequences.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is not so long ago that the European Union’s main concern was the overproduction of food, and our debates were mainly concentrated on how to produce less. Separating subsidies off from production, eliminating export premiums and maintaining production quotas all helped to restrict the potential of European agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Reality verified this policy. The first signs of a food crisis have appeared more rapidly than anyone could have expected. Foodstuffs are becoming more expensive, we have less and less food of our own, and imports are becoming increasingly expensive and increasingly less secure. These are in large measure the consequences of that policy, which is based on persuading agriculture to produce less.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must radically alter our approach to agricultural policy. We must recognise that agriculture is one of the pillars of European security. Alongside physical security and energy security, food security is a fundamental security pillar that is important for both peoples and states and for every individual.

This was the trade-off between pressure from the automobile industry to move the Commission to be less ambitious on car efficiency and to buy or to compensate this less ambitious policy with the higher target on agrofuels.

      <p sl="en">This is factually not possible on a planet which has limited resources, so I urge the Commission to reconsider this. Be more ambitious on car efficiency. We need to go from a unidimensional agrofuel policy to a holistic policy for energy from biomass, and concentrate biomass where it is most efficient, which is in electricity and heat production. By the way, that is cheaper than using agrofuels which are inefficient.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, according to the UN a veritable tidal wave of high prices is threatening more than 40 countries and over 100 million people with famine. Members of the Commission and the Council, it is also bumping up inflation for the poor in the EU much more quickly than overall inflation. For this reason you must move on from discoveries to coordinated public intervention. We are not a theoretical institution here, whose responsibility is merely analysis. Coordinated action is needed, and at a European level. The UN Security Council must also be urgently convened.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, today the headline of the French newspaper Le Monde read: ‘You cannot buy much more for 1 euro’. Increasing food prices, inflation and increasing oil prices are eating away at the family budget. The social consequences of the recession are increasingly making themselves felt. Le Monde’s analysis undoubtedly applies to other Member States too. Some speakers have already pointed out in this debate that, it is all too often forgotten that the purchasing power problem also constitutes a problem for Europe. We all welcome solidarity with the Third World, myself included. As the old saying goes, however: charity begins at home. If we forget that, Europeans will once again be at risk of turning their backs on a policy that they do not understand, particularly if it is not also tailored towards them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have heard it all: the Commission is monitoring the situation. The Commission has allocated hundreds of millions in emergency aid for the people most affected. We could only applaud all these acts of good will, were it not for the fact that they again attest to this typically European malady Kurieren am Symptom. At this moment, I would like to point to just two paradoxes. The Commission says that it is doing all it can to put a stop to the decline in purchasing power. Yet how do you explain to Europeans that you want to maintain the purchasing power, when they are the only ones who will have to raise EUR 200 per family per year for an ambitious climate plan? How do you intend to develop biofuels for our energy requirements and at the same time combat the food shortage? These are just two elements in a major debate, to which too little attention is paid.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion has indeed already moved further on. I should therefore like to concentrate on two points. I believe Mr Schulz is absolutely right in pointing out that the markets – particularly the capital and investment markets – have reacted very strongly to the growing uncertainties, not only following the subprime crisis, nor merely in Europe in recent months, and that many investors have therefore switched over to longer-term and more reliable investments. Ultimately, this is producing truly dramatic consequences for consumers throughout the world because food prices among others have also shot up as a result.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we take a look at raw material funds, for example, we note that some raw material funds have made up to 30% profit in past years. However, it cannot be our idea of a fair world or, of course, of a sustainable policy, where we first of all inflate our prices, where the capital market drives up prices for raw materials and for food, and where we then try subsequently to create solidarity with the nations of southern Africa and of South America in order then to ship correspondingly expensive products out there.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is right that we must try to appeal to the ECB and the international capital markets to do everything they can to improve confidence in the existing conventional investment opportunities so that investors will find their way back to these strategies, to these investment opportunities. Unfortunately, Mr Schulz has not given any indication regarding how this is to be made possible. I believe we are not incapable, and therefore not completely without opportunities, but that we must above all create the impression that the European Central Bank plays a central role here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that I believe that we must also warn against disproportionate alarmism. The rise in food prices is substantial, of course, at the moment – our fellow Member has pointed this out – and it is even of considerable significance for consumers in Europe and is creating dramatic cuts in budgets. Nevertheless, I believe that it has to be our duty to advocate dealing realistically on a sustained basis here in Parliament as well – some fellow Members have also addressed this – with the various sources of energy if we really want to make these aims our own.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, suddenly, a financial and property crisis in the North and a food crisis in the South have demonstrated all the contradictions of deregulated globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Suddenly the markets have begun speculating on food products, because there are enormous profit margins. When the price of rice increases from USD 400 to USD 1 000 in seven weeks no amount of biofuels can justify this massive price rise. This is purely and simply the market, the sacrosanct market, which having speculated on housing and ruined millions of people in debt is now speculating on food, because that is where the money is to be made: USD 1 000 for a tonne of rice!</p>
      <p sl="es">This does not have anything to do with a rational structural problem that can be justified in terms of an increase in demand from the Chinese, or which can be justified in terms of a decrease in supply due to drought.</p>
      <p sl="es">This world needs a little less market and a little more regulation. Globalisation cannot continue to progress through blows that cause catastrophes such as these; it needs to be governed, and governing globalisation now means, among other things, boosting Africa’s capacity for agricultural production.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the Commissioner said, entirely rightly, a continent such as Africa cannot import food. Africa must be self-sufficient, and in order to achieve this there are many policies that we need to change to enable them to develop their productivity, helping them to do what they know how to do and can do, and what they would do if it were not for the circumstances of the markets – once again the markets – which in the quest for competitiveness at all costs have caused massive human tragedies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Haiti imports 80% of the rice that it consumes. A few years ago it was fully self-sufficient. Why is it suddenly importing the rice that is produced in the United States, which is highly subsidised? Why have we put it in a situation of extreme dependency? It is true that biofuels have caused an increase in the price of American corn. When 30% of production is diverted, obviously prices will fluctuate.</p>
      <p sl="es">The price of wheat has not changed, however, as a result of biofuels: 1% cannot cause these sorts of changes. We cannot stop the technological development of what is now an alternative to liquid fuels, and perhaps the only one. Let us avoid excessive diversion, but let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater, or seek scapegoats for problems that are not caused by technological changes or variations in demand, but by speculative movements that the world should not allow and that we, together with all political forces, should fight against.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, since it was introduced in 1957, the common agricultural policy has provided us with abundant quantities of food at reasonable prices. However, consumers are now facing very large price increases for bread and milk owing to rising demand, particularly because there have been several years with very poor harvests around the world. Europeans are now beginning to notice this financially, and for the less fortunate this is already giving rise to difficult situations. For the poorest developing nations and for developing nations that are dependent on food imports, the situation is completely unsustainable. However, for the developing countries that export food, the high prices are beneficial, as their revenues are increasing.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to emphasise the fact that we should make a distinction between the supply shortages and high prices. Supply shortages are something that we should take seriously and react to. However, as long as a litre of cola costs more than a litre of milk, I do not think that the price of milk is unrealistically high. The World Bank has concluded that demand for food will increase by 60% during the period up until 2030, primarily as a result of increased demand from countries such as China and India, where the demand for food is increasing in line with the growth in prosperity. It should also be noted that our grain stocks are the lowest they have been in the last 60 years – stocks are now at a critically low level. Yet another poor harvest in 2008 could lead to a food supply shortage that no one ever thought was possible.</p>
      <p sl="da">We need to appreciate the seriousness of the situation; we need to trade, and we need to take the opportunities available to us. We must find the correct balance between environmental needs and the need to produce sufficient food in order to meet demand. In this connection we cannot progress unless we discuss biotechnology and confront the campaign of fear concerning genetically modified food with objective information. In my opinion, biotechnology offers a number of potential solutions to the current situation. The GMO scare so prevalent around Europe has consequences that are completely absurd. Instead of importing feed in the form of soya beans and maize for our animals, we are feeding them with cereal products that could be used for human food. The blaming of biofuels for the rise in food prices must also be the result of a lack of knowledge of the facts, as food crops are not generally used for biofuels in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have many good tools available. First and foremost, we should use the agricultural industry, which is ready to take up the challenge. We should develop the agricultural industry instead of tending to run it down, which has been the case in politics in recent years. We should retain the environmental benefits that we have achieved, but we have many opportunities to preserve these benefits whilst at the same time increasing production. For example, political decisions determine how much fertiliser we should add to a corn field. It should of course be factual and objective considerations that prevail.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, half way through this century the number of people living on our planet will exceed 9 billion. In addition to population growth we shall see an increase in the demand for food, something we are short of even now – and not just in third countries, but in European countries too. Europe and the world can look forward to a major food crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union’s common agricultural policy, which is based on orders, prohibitions, quotas and contingents, has meant that some states profit from a food crisis while others lose out. Only a few EU countries will come out well from this. Sadly the great majority will suffer losses, including Poland – until recently the EU’s third largest food producer, which in the past could have fed its population twice over.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Food shortages are going hand in glove with higher costs. According to the World Bank, in the last three years food prices have risen by a total of 83%; they are still rising and they will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the governments of many countries know that food shortages threaten the biological security of peoples. Following interventions by numerous representatives, including some from Poland, the European Union released 2 900 000 hectares of fallow land for cereal production and increased the milk quota by 2%. This did not solve the problem, though. The short-sighted EU agricultural policy is still in place. Processing plants are being closed, cultivation areas are dwindling, trees are being grown on arable land and many other actions are being taken that limit food production.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Who will provide us with healthy, cheap foods in the future? American producers certainly will, although they will not be healthy, as they will be genetically modified. Why, then, are we waiting? We already know, surely, that the EU’s agricultural policy as implemented to comply with the expectations of certain interest groups is a road to nowhere, or better, to a loss of biological security in the EU and a deterioration in the situation throughout the world. We therefore need not only a review of the common agricultural policy, but also a re-negotiation of the treaties concluded and a new solution for the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I think that we still need to review the policies that have been adopted in the north and south over the last 20 years: structural adjustment plans implemented by leading international financial institutions, which have undermined the ability of States to organise and regulate their own economies, the withdrawal from and lack of interest in agriculture in the context of public development aid, deregulation, the sudden liberalisation of global trade and financial flows that has led to a form of ecological social dumping and speculation. What makes me uncomfortable is that we offer advice and recommend solutions, but have not really criticised what has been done in previous decades.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, rather than talking about food security, we should allow the countries concerned, particularly in Africa, to develop their own agriculture, to organise their own regional markets and to protect these, yes, protect them in some way, just as the European Union did when it developed its common agricultural policy. To do this, we also need to listen more to farmers’ associations in these countries, which are taking action, which have ideas, which have simple demands that could be supported with resources that are not necessarily extortionate. Let us start, first of all, by listening to people on the ground who are proposing a whole series of initiatives that deserve to be encouraged and supported, especially by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Demonstrations are being bloodily suppressed in Egypt, Somalia, Bangladesh, India and elsewhere. There have been deaths, injuries and hundreds of arrests.

It seems absurd to me that anyone is thinking of feeding developing countries by making them grow plants for fuel rather than food. I cannot support the pro-GMO lobby at all, because biofuels are one thing and foods are another, and what especially concerns me is the monopoly outside Europe on patents and seeds that makes many highly dependent on the United States and European farmers.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, the rise in prices is not due either to climate change or to fuel being expensive, which – though it has an impact – does not do so to the extent that people are saying; it should be pointed out among other things that we are also enjoying a good euro/dollar exchange rate. Instead I am convinced that it is caused by speculation by the distribution sector, especially the major retailers, otherwise how do you explain that in Italy, prices for agricultural produce have changed little in the last seven years and certainly not to the extent by which consumer prices have increased?</p>
      <p sl="it">In Italy, either the multinational major retailers or the cooperatives are using a cartel strategy utterly speculatively to the detriment of consumers.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for 30 years we have had some degree of food stability in the world, and now that has come to an end. It is a dramatic end, it is a sudden end, and it is a shocking end. We see the food riots we have heard of in Haiti – 20 killed, and the price of rice, beans, fruit, going up 50% in a year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is, of course, partly population growth: in my lifetime the world’s population has gone up from two and a half billion to six and a half billion. We cannot do much about that. It is partly the consequence of new wealth in countries such as China, where the demand for, for example, chocolate is going up 15% a year, and that is unsustainable in terms of the supply. We cannot do much about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is partly because of climate change, desertification, changes in rainfall patterns, more flooding and so forth, and we are trying to do something about that. We have a package of measures to tackle that, and of course we have the measures we have heard about today from the Commissioner: food aid and farming support for the poorest countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is partly, though, a result of the rush into biofuels: the EU proposal of a 10% increase in fuel for transport; in America, the 30% of corn crops now going into ethanol, reducing the land available for food and pushing up the price of cornflour.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen the consequences highlighted by the statements by Jean Ziegler about the crime against humanity. That may be overstating it, but there is an element of truth there, and it is certainly true that we have to look for the second-generation biofuels. We have to look for the woody rather than liquid biofuels for transport. We have to grow biofuels sustainably. If we do that – not through monoculture – then we can find biofuels to be part of the solution. But at the moment they are at great risk of being part of the problem.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are aware of the different causes but we are a long way from knowing the contribution of each one to the present situation: a straightforward increase in demand, biofuels, the simple coincidence of bad harvests in several areas of the world, consequences of climate change, pure speculation arising from the previous causes? The Commission has to take action to provide us with answers to these questions quickly and thoroughly. Moreover, there is the added importance of deepening and speeding up the adjourned debate on the health check and the WTO negotiations.</p>

How can we produce more without risking the sustainability of resources and what alternatives can be found, especially for animal nutrition? What new intervention mechanisms should we adopt to prevent strategic public stocks being replaced by speculative private hoarding?

      <p sl="pl">Meanwhile, instead of asking ourselves how we can bring down food prices in the EU, we are subsidising expensive agriculture in the old countries, while in the new accession countries we are supporting the cheaper production of healthy foods only to a limited extent, and this is obviously going to restrict any growth in production in these countries.

Firstly, there have been violent protests against high food prices in Haiti, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries. Secondly, European farmers are demonstrating against the fall in prices in the dairy sector. To all appearances, there are two conflicting reports, but they do belong together and prove that there are many sides to the crisis. We need a package of measures because the temptation to resort to protectionism through food producers and retail chains is an aspect that should be taken seriously and policy must be determined here first.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unlike Mr Borrell, I do no believe that we should be regulating, but that we should be providing greater competition. That is the key! I do not therefore see the often quoted connection between food prices and the cultivation of renewable raw materials. This is disproportionate and not targeted. The fact is that demand for foodstuffs has increased, particularly in China and India. We cannot avoid this, but we do nevertheless have to state that there is still no shortage of food to justify this increase in prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do think, however, that we must introduce measures to increase food production. Our farmers’ benefit payments should therefore be increased along these lines. I believe the revision of our agricultural policy is wrong; it has to be developed further – that is an important principle.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also, however, be looking at our legislation to see whether it is at all appropriate for increasing production. We have a lot of regulations, which restrict the use of fertilisers and pesticides, which cause stresses and strains in the Water Framework Directive. These are not now causing price increases. Here we should once again be thinking about whether major developments are necessary.</p>

This is excellent news, but it is mainly by focusing on these structural causes that the Commission will show that it has grasped the extent of the crisis and that it recognises that both it and the EU are fully accountable for what happens today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For us European Socialists, the current crisis has nothing to do with fate; it is merely the result of very clear political decisions taken by northern countries in general in a whole range of areas. We need to realise that, while people are rioting and there are hunger demonstrations - and who can blame them - the Commission, which has several voices, is still continuing to subsidise exports of its agricultural produce at the expense of millions of small producers in the south who are incapable of competing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Bear in mind that some within the European Union are reducing the amount of public development aid, while continuing to promise and claim the exact opposite. We also need to remember that the Commission is still trying to impose so-called economic partnership agreements on ACP countries, the poorest countries in the world; agreements that they do not want, because it is clear to them that these agreements contain the seeds of other future crises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a long list of decisions that the Union and the European Commission are continuing to take which blatantly contradict the objectives announced regarding development cooperation. What more can be said about a system, our system, in which rice or wheat have become safe investments? Is it really fair to see European banks offer their customers investment products that speculate on the rise in commodity and food prices?</p>

No, we do not. This is why we are calling for greater cohesion between the various policies of the European Union and why we are fiercely lobbying the Commission and Mr Barroso so that we stop this rush towards biofuels by working towards the introduction of a moratorium, like the one proposed by Mr Ziegler before the United Nations, both on their use and production, as long as they compete with food.</p>

The curious thing is that the majority of these people live in the countryside and, would you believe, produce food themselves. This is bizarre. There is something very wrong there. We are now also faced with a tremendous increase in food prices. This is due to various developments, which have already been specified. Increasing prosperity in China and India and an increasing demand for meat products, the European and US objectives in relation to biofuels, rising energy prices … the list continues. The World Food Programme needs USD 7 million more this year in order to help the same number of people as last year. The consequences for the poorest people are immense.</p>
      <p sl="nl">New strategies will be required, first and foremost in the short term. In the near future we will have to supplement the shortfalls that exist within the World Food Programme. I am also happy with the Commissioner’s promises to deploy additional resources in order to achieve this, for example by bringing forward the expenditure on food aid that is anticipated for later this year and by drawing on the reserves for humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, according to an excellent proverb, prevention is better than cure. For that reason we must all look in particular at the longer term policy measures. How can we ensure that developing countries have a secure food supply? What can we encourage and how can we give them space? Do we know which of our policies or those of the IMF or World Bank support or pose a threat to food security? Can we not do more with our agricultural policy? I would like to ask the Commission to what extent food security has featured in the work programme up until now in recent years, because after all, globalisation has not come out of the blue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards prevention being better than cure, I would like to refer to the success formula of the Hunger Project, an international organisation that has already achieved excellent, lasting results in various countries by means of an integrated approach. I would also like to point to the implementation of the joint strategy for Africa, the EU-Africa strategy. That strategy specifically devotes attention to a partnership for the development of the African agricultural sector. My question is how the Commission is also active in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The consequences of speculation are that the cost of grain is in practice tied to the price of oil. The higher that is, the more grain will also be used as fuel, unless we intervene. Now only about 2% of grain is used in the production of biofuel, but that figure is rising. The Organization for Economic Development and the United Nations estimated that if the price of oil reached the 56 dollar level, the production of grain for food would go down by a couple of percentage points and the price of grain, which is to say food, would go up by around 10%. What about if the price of oil kept rising to reach the 100 dollar mark, which is where it is now? We urgently need international norms and agreements, so that the rise in the cost of food can be halted, as can the switch from the use of grain to make bread to the use of grain to make fuel for four-by-fours on our roads.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We might imagine all sorts of threatening scenarios, but there is some good news. Russia is working on a scheme to produce competitive renewable energy for the European market.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I am very much of the opinion that we have a serious problem to deal with here. I would, however, strongly advise that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water, but instead determine the real reasons behind this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am rather astonished that this debate about food comes as such a surprise to many of our fellow Members. The world’s population has been continually expanding over the last 20 years. Each year there are an additional 80 million people. Anyone who is now surprised, therefore, should be asking themselves where they have been recently.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to look at which points we can do something about and which ones we are unlikely to be able to do anything about. I believe that one objectionable item is the issue of worldwide stock market speculation on cereal and cocoa products. Assets on the stock markets are huge and speculators are now climbing aboard instead of investing in raw materials. This naturally leads to rising prices and human suffering, which, incidentally, also affects livestock farmers in Europe. We must provide aggressive measures here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The export rebate is dear to our hearts and everyone says this must now be abolished. This we have already done, by the way, and it expires in 2013. We should not forget, however, to say to the United States that it must likewise phase out its food aid, because only then, when we do this together, can the instrument work. If it is to work, then we must direct agricultural policy and production in the difficult countries of this world. For this we need stable political relations in these countries. Mismanagement is disappointing to many farmers, ownership rights are unclear, enormous basic taxes have to be paid to corrupt governments. We do unfortunately have race conflicts and there is no equity at all for seed and tractors. How is a farmer to produce crops – I am indeed one myself – when he has no seed? We have to turn our attention to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I could envisage the need for a European foreign agricultural policy. The European Union has to throw all its weight into the equation in order to pick up on these shortcomings.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Council representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to underline the severity of the food crisis and its dramatic consequences in terms of exacerbating poverty and famine for people in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most disadvantaged people in our western countries are also affected by the rise in food prices and have been struggling for months with the daily price increases. An urgent response is needed for this situation, as well as tailored solutions in the longer term, with the common agricultural policy recast as a development aid policy and a WTO-style trade policy preventing abuse of the dominant position by supermarkets in Europe, as well as food speculation, since agriculture is no ordinary economic sector. The risks of famine and social and political destabilisation are too great, and I should remind you that the right to food is a fundamental human right. We cannot leave agriculture to market economics alone, or to speculators who are today in search of safe investments following the property slump and the energy and mineral crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must equip ourselves with the tools of market regulation and solid and coherent agricultural and food policies, and replenish emergency stocks as soon as possible so that we can react to this kind of emergency. In developing countries, we must also prioritise food production and food crops over non-food production, particularly agrofuels.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the food crisis we are now facing risks setting mankind back a decade when it comes to poverty, and risks creating instability and human misery in a large part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that it is important to emphasise this, and also to state that we in the agriculture sector have not seen the same rapid development as experienced in the parts of the world’s economy which have been globalised. What we see is the failure of regulated agricultural markets, a lack of open trade, and regulation which prevents farmers from using their land. It is clear that, if we wish to, we can also decide to tackle many of the difficult problems we are currently struggling with. Greater use of the available areas of the earth’s surface is a good thing in the battle for a better climate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Having more cultivated products contributes towards biofuels as well as food. However, at the same time there is also an opportunity to open the doors to economic development in the developing world. At the same time this gives us in Europe the opportunity to pave the way for a more dynamic and open agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the answer to these problems does not lie in more regulation and more subsidies. Instead it lies in greater openness for Europe’s farmers and farmers the world over to produce the food and the biofuels which the world needs. This is freer agriculture, freer farmers and free trade.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If we manage to achieve this, we will also be able to make more progress in the international Doha negotiations, the free trade negotiations, while simultaneously doing something towards a better climate and a better world.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, social tensions in Europe, human catastrophe on other continents – and the effect of price increases in food in Europe, mostly in poor urban areas, has now reached the middle classes too. On the continent of Europe there are about one hundred million poor people in the Union, and in Hungary there are about three million people living below the poverty threshold whose difficult situation is exacerbated by the effect both of price increases for food containing fruit and of meat shortages. The EU programmes already in place, such as the school milk and school fruit programmes, are therefore extremely important. The current crisis shows that we need a new agricultural policy for 2013. The EU must produce the majority of its food, and food of good quality, and must also assist countries not in the EU with know-how, knowledge transfer and developments in agricultural production, so that this global problem of ever-increasing severity can be solved.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the rise in demand from emerging economies, the increase in the price of oil, and climate change are factors that have contributed to the rise in food prices throughout the world, yet they do not explain everything. The turbulent rise of the financial markets has contributed to increasing speculation, driven by the yields offered by raw material funds. The proof is in the increase not only in food prices, but also in the price of nickel, silver and gold.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Food prices have shot up 83% since 2005, which, when linked with the high percentage of income that the poorest spend on food, means that we are now faced with the most important factor in increasing poverty and inequality. Yet even more serious is the possibility that we may be on the cusp of a worldwide tragedy of incalculable proportions, which may lead to hunger and death for millions of people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The International Monetary Fund warned against this very situation when it stated that if food prices remain at their current levels, more than 100 million people could die, the majority in Africa. Concerted international intervention is thus urgently needed in order to step up aid to the most needy, because we are dealing with millions of life and death cases here. But this is not enough! Mechanisms to regulate international trade and for effective financial market supervision need to be created to prevent speculative operations that benefit only a small minority at the expense of hundreds of millions of poor and defenceless people. The European Union has an obligation to lead this process at the global level, as it is only through such a stance that the goal of eradicating poverty and promoting peace throughout the world will cease to be utopian.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I do not believe that poor people in developing countries would fare better if we allowed market forces greater scope to operate in the food markets without regulation, as has been proposed here. Global capitalism is headed for a moral crisis if it transpires that the origin of the food crisis lies with stock market speculators.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Here people have spoken of biofuels and the way they compete with food production for land. It has been stated here that this competition has not been very great, at least until now. Nevertheless, the problem needs to be analysed thoroughly, although we should not jump to any hasty conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need fuels obtainable from renewable sources, but obviously not in a way that deprives food production of space. Different countries and research institutes are now spending large sums of money on research into second and third generation biofuels. These fuels do not compete with food production. It has been estimated that the new generation fuels will be on the market in just a few years from now. There is no reason to prevent research in this field, and for that reason we need to draw up clear sustainability criteria for biofuels and produce second and third generation biofuels in a sustainable way.</p>

      <p sl="sk">When solving problems such as the one we are dealing with today, we should pause to think about what caused them in the first place. The demographic crisis, human trafficking, global warming, cancer or terrorism have not just appeared by chance or overnight, nor did the problem of rising food prices.</p>
      <p sl="sk">By the same token, when dealing with rising food prices and its impact on the population we are inclined more often than not to look for solutions to the consequences without thinking about the causes. The truth, however, is that we can only prevent the crisis from deteriorating if we get to the root of the problem. When dealing with rising food prices and food crises in some parts of the world we also have to address the issues of the quality and quantity of food, which is one of the fundamental aspects of the lives of every man, woman, family or nation on this planet.</p>
      <p sl="sk">How can a young person develop physically, intellectually and spiritually without access to the necessary nutrition? How can a mother and father provide for their family unless they have the food they need to do so? We must not forget that the richest countries are those that used to exploit, often without due consideration, the wealth of poor countries without any compensation. They did not respect an ecological balance, and today we can see the impact of their actions on the poorest populations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Perhaps we do not have to look too far. We should look at our own institutions, throwing away a lot of food every day because of internal regulations, while people suffering from hunger live nearby. Everywhere in the world, hungry people usually make bad partners.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is now one more challenge for us to meet: to secure our food supply. We have witnessed a massive rise in the price of food and this will remain the position for a considerable time to come. The supply of cheap food has disappeared. I have always been one of those who believed that there was never any such thing as cheap food, but when you direct grain away from food supply to produce energy, then you have changed the balance. What we are seeing now is the knock-on effect of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know the reason for this, but it will be those countries who can afford it least that will be affected the most. There is no need any more for set-aside, and we now have a moral duty to encourage our farmers to produce more to ensure that prices do not spiral out of total control and that many regions of the world do not suffer starvation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must look again at the Health Check to ensure that we can respond to the changed situation. This will have a bitter-sweet effect on farmers and their families. For years, they have been ridiculed about milk lakes and butter mountains. Where are they now? They are all gone. In Europe, we now have only 27 days of food supply left, as Mr Daul told us earlier this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, I believe we must look at the situation regarding the standards for GMOs. We cannot turn a blind eye to this any more. We are over-regulating ourselves out of the marketplace. We have placed such constraints on our farmers that many have just given up and walked away. We need more production or there will be a disaster. We must encourage our farmers to produce that extra food. This was not predicted, nor was it foreseen by anyone, no matter how hard they may now try to look back and tell us that they did. The truth is that it has come upon us. We must now respond to it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fairy tales usually begin with the words ‘once upon a time’. I should also like to begin my speech like this. Once upon a time there was a world trade organisation called the WTO, which wanted to create a worldwide balance between supply and demand through totally free trade. It promised people in the poorest countries a substantial increase in prosperity and people in the rich countries cheap food through the liberalisation of trade. This is the fairy tale; the reality is somewhat different.</p>
      <p sl="de">Worldwide free trade in agriculture is not appropriate for fighting global hunger and poverty on a sustained basis. The World Bank and the WTO need to be aware of this. Worldwide free trade in agriculture serves only a very few agricultural conglomerates, which export food from the poorest countries without any regard for the food situation itself. Poverty cannot be combated effectively through global agricultural trade. People in the poor regions are no longer able to afford food at high farm prices, and farmers in highly developed regions are no longer able to produce food at low farm prices because it is not profitable at that level. Both clash. Whether Mr Zoellick from the World Bank, Mr Lamy from the WTO and – unfortunately I do need to say this – my colleague Mr Hökmark from my own group grasp these connections, I very much doubt. Therefore, nothing much will change in the situation in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to farm prices in Europe, in 1961 I received 26 cents for 1 kilo of grain. Two years ago I received 8 cents. Farm prices cannot therefore be the cause of high food prices!</p>

      <p sl="sl">() I think that fundamental restructuring of agricultural policy is required regarding the various quotas, quantity allocations, restrictions and different incentives not to produce food. I am also interested to see how much untilled arable land there still is in Europe. I fully support the statement made by Mr Nicholson, that agricultural production in Europe should be stimulated, and that incentives for halting a reduction in the agricultural sector should be considered. The young are leaving, so who will remain to work the land?</p>
      <p sl="sl">The fact that there is a shortage of food does not mean that the gates should be opened wide to genetically modified agricultural products. Also, I think that we need to revise our expectations regarding biofuels, and that on domestic markets we ought to examine why it is that high prices always bring superstores the highest profits. In brief, I anticipate that the European Commission will prepare immediate measures, as well as a strategy for this new situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are facing a situation now that we have sleepwalked into, because for too long food was too cheap: it was below the cost of production. Three years ago wheat was EUR 90 per tonne, which was below the cost of production. Now it is about EUR 270 per tonne, and it is profitable to produce.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not as pessimistic as many speakers here today, because if the market is paying the right price for food, then it will be produced. Therefore, we have to free up that market. Europe can produce food: farmers in Europe have been dying for the opportunity to produce food, but for 20 years they have been told that there was too much food in the world and, therefore, food production had to be reduced. Therefore, we have to use biotechnology to help us increase food production, we have to reduce bureaucracy and, in the mean time, we have to help the poorest in the world through this short-term crisis, because that is what it is. In a country like Zimbabwe in Africa, it is also about good governance: if a madman is controlling the country, it will never be fed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is one of the most important debates – both political and economic – here in Parliament, as is borne out by the make-up of those who have contributed to it today. This debate concerns not only the rise in food prices, but also deaths caused by hunger. Today’s voices in this Chamber and the alarming analyses say what they say. The price of wheat has risen by 130% in the last year alone, that of soya by 87% and that of rice by 74% – these are facts. During the last 30 years we have brought prices down, but what has happened during the past year has trumped all the warning signals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The facts are as follows: there is a worldwide shortage of food; there is hunger – 850 million people are going hungry. In a dozen or more countries there have been riots, and these will get worse. Tropical forests have been felled en masse, along with the Amazon Rainforest – in other words, the desire for biofuels outweighs the desire for a reduction in world hunger. During the next few years there will be a global shortfall of 200 million tonnes of grain. Global inflation will rise, there will be a continuing water shortage, and consumers in Europe will be forking out 30-40% more from their wallets than they did a year ago.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What should we do? Urgently reform the common agricultural policy, as there are millions of farmers in Europe too who are suffering from poverty, and convene an international conference at the first available opportunity that will take certain decisions and draw certain conclusions from this discussion and this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Mandelson put that legislation in place and it is causing a huge problem, because you need three things to produce food: sun, water and also nitrogen, phosphate and potash. Third world countries cannot produce food unless they can get this at an affordable price, and at the moment it has risen from about GBP 80 a tonne to something like GBP 500 a tonne.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, for several years now we have been talking in the European Union and at the WTO about liberalisation of trade, which was meant to be understood as facilitation of trade, but in reality we are implementing a restriction on agricultural production. In Europe, and not only in Europe, we have been restricting production systematically for quite some time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The global rise in food prices is the result of a rise in production costs, energy and fuel costs and fertiliser and labour costs. Let us not forget, however, that little more than a year ago the price of a barrel of oil was USD 70, the profitability of agricultural production was different, and so was the profitability of biofuels, whereas today a barrel of oil costs USD 115. Biofuels are not the cause of the crisis, though. Biofuels account for only 2% of agricultural production, so they are only partly to blame.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I see much concern today, not to say fear, even here in this Chamber, but sudden, unconsidered action will not help. We need a stable agricultural policy, but we must seek stabilisation not only in agriculture, but also in financial markets. The lack of monitoring of financial markets is giving rise to speculation and the appearance of dangerous situations, firstly on the mortgage market, and then on the foodstuffs market. Stabilisation in financial markets.</p>

      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office. − () Mr Dillen, a Member of the European Parliament, said that in the situation concerning the food market, we should not just alleviate the symptoms, but cure the illness. In order to do that, we must establish the correct diagnosis. In my opinion this was a very useful debate and it will also help the Council in establishing the diagnosis, and in finding the right answers and cures.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, what are the reasons that caused the situation on the world food market and the dramatic rise in food prices? The main reason is greater demand. As has already been mentioned, the world’s population has grown, and a large part of this is now due to a higher standard of living. And no one has the right to expect them to return to their previous meagre nutrition patterns.</p>
      <p sl="sl">What is the answer to this great demand? Increasing supplies. I should like to mention here that the Council has already adopted certain measures. As I have already mentioned in my introductory speech, by temporarily abolishing the fallow land obligation we ensure that European farmers can productively use an additional 10% of agricultural land. The significance of this is also evident from the statement made by Joseph Daul on the amount of land in Europe currently dedicated to biofuel. More about this later.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have also increased the milk quota by 2%. These are only a few measures that the Council has adopted in order to increase supply. Apart from increasing supply in the European Union itself, it is, of course, necessary to act in order to increase food production in other parts of the world, in particular in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Another reason is more expensive production, because of higher energy prices, among other things. To find the answers we must look into more intensive research, rationalisation, new technologies, and innovative production in farming.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Climate change is definitely another reason. Long-term droughts in one of the world’s largest producers of cereals and rice have reduced the country’s yields and its contribution to supply on the world market. This is where the European Union is looking for answers, following the line that has been indicated in the batch of energy legislation currently under negotiation, and for which the Presidency has set itself a firm target of seeking to reach agreement by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Now a word or two about biofuels. No doubt there is some connection, but it is not possible to maintain that this is one of the main reasons for the current situation on the food market. In spite of this, the world is considering this aspect very seriously as well. For this reason, on the initiative of the Slovenian Presidency, an ad hoc task group was recently set up, its main task being to draw up permanent criteria for the production of biofuels. The purpose of the criteria would be that the production of biofuels should not replace food production, that the social aspects and impact of the production of biofuels are taken into consideration, and that biodiversity is preserved. However, these are just a few words about the Council’s activities and its approach to this serious problem.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I should like to add something else. A combination of high food prices and poverty is the worst possible combination. It is a lethal combination leading to unrest in a number of developing countries; it is a combination leading to starvation. Considering that we shall probably be faced with high food prices for some time to come, we must do more to eliminate poverty, and the Slovene Presidency will make efforts to this end. In our view, one of the important themes for the next session of the European Council is this millennium’s development objective. Europe’s progress towards realising these objectives has almost come to a halt. We would like to provide the European Union with fresh impetus to achieve these objectives, and, as I mentioned earlier, in our view this is one of the significant topics for the June European Union Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given the short time available to me, I would like to answer very briefly. However, first I would like to make one or two criticisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Evidently I share some of the considerations and points that have been made, although not all of them, so I will try to focus on the factors that need clarification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I clearly agree that solutions cannot be implemented effectively by the European Union alone; that is quite obvious but also rather enlightening. It is clear that these solutions must be implemented by all major stakeholders, and I believe that this process is under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to point out that what I have heard here today is excellent for democracy and for adversarial debate. However, I have still witnessed rather perfunctory ideological positions – and an extremely radical one, in one case – being adopted. I respect that, I have absolutely no prejudices on the subject, but if there is one thing that from my point of view is not a solution to the food crisis, it is short-sighted and narrow-minded ideological rhetoric. I do not believe that this will offer us a solution, because the problem is many-sided and multifaceted. There is a whole series of answers for a whole series of causes, as the Minister said. There is not one single cause.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Take biofuels, for example. The European Commission has always stressed that it is vital to ensure that investments in biofuel development translate into tangible effects for poverty, particularly in rural areas. We have never recommended or said that biofuels should be grown everywhere. We can only grow biofuels where there is evidence of possible overproduction. In countries where there is no self-sufficiency, it is obviously extremely dangerous and absolutely inadvisable to grow biofuels. Therefore, the solutions are not as simple as that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say something else, which is that basically I do not understand. I hear MEPs who, I think, still believe in the effectiveness, honour and values of Europe, as well as feeling a certain pride in being European. I hear them constantly complaining and apologising. Basically this is all meant to be Europe’s fault. I do not accept that. Someone said that Europe did not like or was not helping developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe today accounts for 56% of world aid. In terms of food aid, today Europe finances produce on local markets and does not send its agricultural surplus to developing countries. We also need to stop talking nonsense about the political responsibility of Europe. Personally, I am rather proud of what Europe has done over the last 50 years, particularly for developing countries even if no one else will say it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Biofuels: I have already answered that question. It is clear that the WTO must be reformed, that we must go further with the WTO. However, if there was no WTO, where would we be? What would happen to world poverty? The WTO is the first international organisation to try to restore some ethical principles to global trade. I am reminding you of this because it is all too easy to throw the baby out with the bathwater. This is one ideological prejudice that I would like to get rid of. We must be reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">GMOs: on this subject, I am of course speaking in a personal capacity, because it is frowned on to become unilaterally involved in this issue. Personally, I am not one of those people who thinks that this issue has already been settled. To say that GMOs are a bad thing, just like that, is an ideological prejudice. It is a kind of scientism, a kind of improvised scientism. I believe that there is nothing wrong with continuing research into trying to ensure food self-sufficiency, particularly in poor countries. It is intellectually rational. To do otherwise would not be intellectually rational, it would not be open-minded. I think this is something that needs to be said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not going to come back to you, Mr Hutchinson, on your constant refrain about EPAs, because I truly have too much admiration and esteem for you. Would you like me to tell you that if I am in favour of EPAs, of economic partnership agreements to create regional markets, then it is because I believe that to tackle the question of food security, economic partnership agreements are probably part of the solution, because until we have regional markets that are economically integrated, developing countries will not be able to benefit from globalisation? There is my answer. We cannot agree, in fact in my opinion we will never see eye to eye on this subject, although I think that it is important nonetheless to remind you of my position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have heard people talking today about capitalist barbarianism. I do not really understand what that is. For me, capitalism is an economic mechanism, it is an economic machine that, until proven otherwise, has demonstrated its benefits more than any other system. Of course, I have said it often before, I am no lover of capitalism. Capitalism is not an object of my affection, it is simply a means to an end.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, I do often like to distinguish between capitalism and liberalism. Clearly, my socialist friends are keen to combine these, yet the two things are not the same. Even I have to say it. Fine, so capitalism is a means to an end and nothing more than that. I agree that a market economy and capitalism cannot be virtuous without a government to lay down rules, to enforce them and to redistribute the wealth created properly and fairly, but please do not let us get bogged down in ideological simplification, because if we do there will be no end to this crisis. I think this has to be said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is pretty much what I wanted to say on the subject. This subject is not closed. I have heard valid and important arguments from both sides of the chamber. As the Minister said, we need to continue this discussion, but right now I am faced with an emergency. We need to help the WFP find ways of preventing an imminent food disaster. The second priority, in the medium term, is to give massive support to developing countries that are not self-sufficient so that they can produce more. Nevertheless, when I hear all these people saying that they want to introduce laws and regulations, I wonder whether we need to rein in the market economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I should remind you that our agriculture is one of the few economic sectors which has come under enormous regulation and I would even say improvised dirigisme. Dirigisme, when it is not improvised, can deliver results, but stop-and-go, improvised dirigisme is rather dangerous. If the effects of this policy in the agricultural sector have not been totally convincing, perhaps we should ask ourselves, as was said earlier, whether this is not precisely because there has been too much improvised dirigisme instead of natural globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not a fan of globalisation, I am simply saying that it is there, we cannot constrain it. Yes, we can introduce rules, through the WTO, through the United Nations, through any number of international organisations, but to say that we can legislate on all of this overnight and get rid of all the systemic abuses through regulations that you do not have the power to issue, then I do not really see how this can be done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I too wish to be pragmatic. We will pull out all the stops, and have already done so, in order to increase production in developing countries; this seems to me to be the only real solution to tackling this phenomenon, which admittedly I was critical of at first. I wanted to really raise awareness because, if nothing is done, there will be a humanitarian disaster, a food tsunami, with conflict, with truly unmanageable situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you for this debate. I think this is a subject we will return to. It has been extremely productive and interesting. What I will take away with me are the best arguments that I have heard from both sides, which I will try to use to defend a cause which is still, when all is said and done, a common cause.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">My country, Poland, which I represent here in the forum of the European Parliament, could be a major producer of agricultural products, and much healthier products than the food currently produced in the West. As a result of errors made by our negotiators when we acceded to the EU, we were obliged by the limits imposed on us to place significant restrictions on Polish agricultural production. This policy of artificially restricting food production is now having drastic consequences for the whole of Europe. The most pain inflicted by the increase in food prices, plus galloping inflation in energy prices, is being felt by pensioners. The poverty zone in Europe is growing alarmingly and embracing increasing numbers of people, particularly families with many children, who are currently finding it difficult to survive from one month to the next.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the new Member States, including Poland, there are many land areas that have so far never been managed. Through their use, industry could begin producing biofuels, for example, which are having a significant impact on the current rise in food prices. This requires a radical change in how the problem is approached by European Commission officials, however, as well as the taking of immediate steps to utilise the production potential of the new Member States.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-296" speaker_id="4466" name="Ilda Figueiredo" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="pt">The causes of rising food prices in the European Union and developing countries vary, but we cannot ignore the contribution of the CAP and of agriculture being diverted towards biofuel production.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Several bodies are highlighting this issue. For instance, the EEA Scientific Committee said it believed the EU should suspend the 10% target for biofuel use by 2020. Even the President of the World Bank talked about countries facing food shortages and called on producers of biofuel raw materials to temporarily cease their cultivation. The FAO itself has already issued a warning about food riots. There have been demonstrations and serious social tension in various African and Asian countries because of food shortages. Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, said that mass production of biofuels was a crime against humanity because of its impact on global food prices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore all the more baffling that the European Commission has confirmed that it will stand by the target of 10% of the fuel used in road transport being generated by biomass or plant oils.</p>

      <p sl="ro">According to Eurostat, in 2007, the real prices of agricultural products increased 5% in the Union as compared to 2006, and the biggest increase, of 15.8%, was recorded in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Europe, the increase in the price of milk and chicken was 7.8% and the greatest increase in the prices of agricultural products was recorded for cereals (45.4%) and fodder crops (11.5%). In this case too, Romania recorded the greatest increase (29.2%).</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last year in Europe the producer price of agricultural products increased by 4.6%, while producer costs increased by 5.3%, and the level of subsidies decreased by 3.1%. In the new Member States, the costs of agricultural producers increased dramatically, and the subsidies are very low. The largest declines of income per farmer were recorded in Bulgaria (-18.6%) and Romania (-16.1%). The low value, non-payment of agricultural subsidies and difficult access to agricultural loans made it impossible to implement the agricultural technologies and thus very small productions were obtained per hectare.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The competition for using agricultural land also contributes to the increase in the prices of food products and, in 2007, the area designed for biofuel cultures increased by 13.6% as compared to 2006, and by 31.5% as compared to 2002-2006.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The latest developments on the global markets of agricultural products have generated a situation that few governments are prepared to deal with. The spectacular price increases, especially for basic cereals, risk starvation for millions of people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This new reality should receive an answer from governments and European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This new level of agricultural prices presents new opportunities for producers, including for those of the EU Member States. In Romania, 40% of the population live in a rural environment, many of them being agricultural producers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The new realities of the markets of agricultural products represent a chance for them to improve their economic results and, implicitly, to increase their living standard.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, the agricultural segment reacts very slowly to price changes on global markets. Small producers deal with heavy bureaucracy and are disadvantaged when negotiating purchase contracts against big chains of distributors with dominant positions on the market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The EU should support small agricultural producers in order for them to benefit from higher income from their work. The access of small agricultural producers to the markets should be facilitated and global distributors should be subject to transparent regulations, which would prevent anti-competitive policies.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0144/2008) by Mrs Barsi-Pataky, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the further implementation of the European satellite radionavigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo) (COM(2007)0535 – C6-0345/2007 – 2004/0156(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office. − () I am delighted to be here with you in today’s plenary session dedicated to the debate on the Galileo Implementation Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We are all very much aware of the geostrategic and economic significance that the Galileo programme and EGNOS have for the European Union. However, before I address the text that has been tabled, allow me to mention briefly the decisive events that these two programmes have faced over the past year.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Under the German Presidency, in June 2007 the Council endorsed a courageous decision to discontinue the unsuccessful negotiations on concessions. This initiative was followed by the European Parliament's Resolution expressing strong support for the two programmes to be continued under the auspices of the European Union, and making an unequivocal call for the entire funding to be secured from the European Union’s budget.</p>
      <p sl="sl">When later on, in September 2007, the Commission tabled a bundle of proposals which would steer the projects towards 100% funding from the public sector, amongst the proposals was a regulation on implementation. Owing to the agreement reached in November last year between the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament on a resolution, and a general decision which the TTE Council endorsed a week later, through conclusions regarding the future development of Galileo, we have succeeded in getting the two programmes out of the cul-de-sac and returned them to the public domain.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am pleased that when they were looking for a compromise on the legal basis so that the Galileo project could be brought to life in its entirety, all three institutions engaged in constructive cooperation. I should especially like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur Mrs Barsi-Pataky, as well as to Mrs Angelika Niebler, the Chairman of the ITRE Committee. The Slovenian Presidency prides itself on having made all necessary efforts to reach agreement during its first reading.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I believe that the result of our negotiations is a balanced text. The text before us specifies the budgeted amount required for the programmes over the period 2007–2013, as well as the management and implementation of GNSS programmes, including the public procurement principles and structure. We have all accepted the responsibility which the European Parliament has towards citizens, as the budgetary authority</p>
      <p sl="sl">In order to facilitate the fulfilment of each task as regards programmes, we have formed an interinstitutional committee for Galileo. The committee will monitor progress in implementing these programmes, the international agreements associated with the two programmes, the preparation of markets, the efficiency of the management structure, and the annual programme review.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is not necessary to particularly emphasise the importance of the European satellite navigation programmes to the creation of new jobs and European competitiveness. The two programmes are completely consistent with the Lisbon strategy and other Community policies, and they will enable us to develop and protect European know-how, particularly in the area of applications, which will directly benefit our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I should like to thank you for your attention and, in particular, for your constructive cooperation in this important European project.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-302" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, clearly this part-session is of major importance. I believe that together we can congratulate ourselves for finally seeing Galileo emerge as a major European project able to be realised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the end of November 2007, two major political decisions were made in favour of this major European project. Since then, the European Parliament and the Council, conscious of the need to swiftly adopt regulations relating to the continuation of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes, examined the text of the Commission’s proposal with a view to adoption at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to pay homage to the constructive work of the three institutions, particularly Parliament. Thanks to the efforts of each and all of them, we have made enormous progress in the various tripartite dialogues and are today looking at a draft regulation that satisfies Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Council, at its sitting on 7 April 2008, under your presidency, Minister, expressed itself largely in favour. It is therefore crucial, ladies and gentlemen, that Parliament also expresses itself in favour today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can confirm that the proposal includes financing for programmes in complete accordance with the budgetary agreement reached in November 2007 between the European Parliament and the Council. I should again like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the European Parliament for the major role that it has played in bringing about this result. The text also establishes satisfactory governance of the programmes. It proposes a strict division of tasks between the Commission, the supervisory authority and the European Space Agency, with the Commission being assigned the role of owner and the European Space Agency the role of manager.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The future regulation also tackles the issue of safety and security of systems. This aspect of the programmes, while essential, had not previously been addressed so clearly and satisfactorily. The Commission will from now on ensure the management of the programme with the permanent and valuable support of the Member States, which have the requisite expertise in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this point, I can confirm that the Galileo infrastructure is designed to serve the five functions described in the annex to the future regulation. The provisions of the text relating to security in no way affect the scope of this annex. Any amendment that might undermine the civil nature of the Galileo programme should entail a revision of the regulation. We have been conscious of the question of procurement policy. We need both to assess the competencies of the industrial stakeholders in each Member State and at the same time, through fair competition of course, limit the attendant risks of excess and delay.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the question of fundamental ownership, for the three Community institutions, the regulation provides that the European Community must be the sole owner of all tangible and intangible assets developed under the EGNOS and Galileo programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, provisions relating to committee procedure and the specific framework established alongside the regulation satisfy Parliament’s wishes to be kept constantly informed of the progress of the programmes. Naturally, given the role played by Parliament so far, it is clearly preferable and even essential that Parliament, as budgetary authority, is closely involved in the future of this programme. The swift adoption of the text proposed would represent the first stage in governance reform of the programmes. The Commission should table a proposal amending the regulation in terms of the management structures of the European GNSS programmes. We will adapt the regulation to the new authority and supervision roles based on the text that you have negotiated with the Council. I will personally see to it that Parliament is closely involved in this second stage of public governance reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we are counting on you to support Galileo and to open up the way for effective and swift implementation of this vast Community project. Over the next few months, we will have the chance to cover all of the numerous applications that Galileo might have and, in this regard, an action plan will be unveiled by the Commission. However, for these applications to become a reality, clearly Galileo must materialise. Mr President, thanks to the European Parliament, and thanks to the Portuguese and Slovenian presidencies, Galileo now has, I believe, every chance of success.</p>

    <intervention id="2-303" speaker_id="28136" name="Etelka Barsi-Pataky" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Žerjav, Vice-President Barrot, ladies and gentlemen. The European Parliament has given continuous and positive support to the Galileo programme since its inception. In November last year, 2007, the European Parliament, in a bold step, moved the programme out of the doldrums and in December approved the financing for the development of the GNSS programmes from a revised Community budget.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are now discussing a regulation on the implementation of the Galileo and EGNOS GNSS programmes following a successful informal trialogue in the first reading. Financing, which will be completely from the Community budget, necessitates special responsibility to European taxpayers and the careful regulation that goes with it. This is particularly true for financing, programme governance, public procurement procedures and security. We have learned so much in the past few years, being confronted with so many problems. With regulations, too, we are going down an entirely new road, you could say we are blazing a trail, since this is the first common European infrastructure which is being built up jointly and is under common Community ownership.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Financing – the European Parliament recognises that the development cost of the programme is EUR 3.4 billion, assured by the budgetary authorities. The Commission will also be asked to submit a proposal by 2010 for post-2013 financing, in particular for common ownership commitments. Please note that keeping to schedules and avoiding further delay are pivotal in achieving the financial success of the programmes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Pricing policy will be determined after detailed analysis of the utilisation stage, bearing in mind that consumers will be getting a good quality service. Management of the programme will be designed for clear shared authority. The Commission is responsible for programme implementation and programme management and will be aided in its work, in committee procedures, by the Programme Committee. The European Space Agency (ESA) is the prime contractor, and it is to be noted that the contractual agreement between the Commission and the ESA will be a pledge of the programme’s success. After long debate, the GSA (the European GNSS Supervisory Authority) will oversee programme security.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Parliament, the Council and the committee recognise that new forms of cooperation must be found, in order for the programme to succeed. In future, in line with the declaration in the Annex we will jointly follow the progress of implementation of the programme quarterly, in the Interinstitutional Panel, and the work programme will be reviewed annually. The regulations on public procurement procedures were an important part of the November rapporteur’s report, and the key elements have been incorporated into the Council proposal. We are in complete agreement with the latter. With the Galileo programme we have hopes of new technology, development, new business opportunities and work, and we particularly stress the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises in all 27 Member States. The regulations provide for this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Parliament’s negotiating delegation, under the chairmanship of Angelika Niebler, ITRE Chairwoman (Committee on Industry, Research and Energy), and with the participation of shadow rapporteurs and representatives of opinion-giving committees, submitted the text approved in the first reading as part of the informal trialogue to the ITRE Committee. The ITRE Committee approved it unanimously. We now submit these regulations to the European Parliament in plenary. Finally, I am grateful to the Slovene Presidency for its commitment to the programme, to the Commission for its expert work, and to my colleagues for their support, which has made agreement possible. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, let me for my part express satisfaction with the result we have reached. This of course promises to be an anomaly: usually the Committee on Budgets is called on to find the money for a specific programme, but here the reverse has been the case. We had already found the money, and we were trying to determine the structure of the programme. After sitting for some 40 days in talks with the Council, we finally succeeded.</p>
      <p sl="el">The final approval of Galileo, in my view, demonstrates three important facts. Firstly, just when Europe is accused of having no ambitions of being in turmoil, our willingness to find the resources for such a technologically ambitious plan proves that the EU can more than answer its critics when it comes to benefiting citizens and business.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, as Commissioner Barrot has pointed out, without the European Parliament there would have been no Galileo. The European Parliament has played a key part in negotiating with the Council over finding the resources, particularly in view of the private sector’s failure to commit funds, in contrast to earlier promises.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly and finally, we now have a programme funded entirely by the Community. As this is a programme backed exclusively and solely by the European taxpayer, it places special obligations on the European Parliament, and on the managers of the programme, who are the European Commission, the ESA and the Galileo Supervisory Authority.</p>
      <p sl="el">We will not shrink from this responsibility. Until 2013 we will monitor the management of the programme very closely. A great deal of money is involved, so our responsibilities are particularly onerous.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thank you very much, and I congratulate all those who have worked to achieve this highly satisfactory result.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would also like to express my considerable satisfaction with the result that we have achieved today. In the future, Galileo will ensure more effective, secure and environmentally sound transport. For all modes of transport by road, rail, air and sea, this system will facilitate better management and control. This applies to private enterprises, to the authorities and to better information for us as citizens.</p>
      <p sl="da">Many people have asked: why do we need Galileo when we already have GPS? However, we only have GPS on loan. The EU has no control over the technology; as satellite navigation is becoming pivotal to our society, the EU should have both its own infrastructure and extensive knowledge and expertise. As we are now sending this EUR 3.5 billion of EU taxpayers’ money out into space for Galileo, we must ensure that it achieves the desired results. Therefore, it is important that Parliament has an influence on future processes.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for the excellent cooperation on this report. I would also like to thank Mr Schinas and the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler, for their good cooperation and for the fact that we have worked as a team during the negotiations. I would also like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his contribution in tying up the loose ends. Last but not least, I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on the excellent result that we have achieved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is a good day for Europe. We are giving the green light to one of the most important EU projects – the Galileo satellite navigation system. Like the previous speaker, I would also like to begin by saying a sincere thank you, thank you to our rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, and to the Members of the Committee on Budgets and of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their excellent cooperation. I think that as Parliament we have worked very well together on this dossier and, together with the Council and the Commission, have achieved a really good result.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether we need a European satellite navigation system has been discussed on many occasions. Mrs Jensen has been addressing this. We still have the American GPS, the Russians have GLONASS, and the Chinese are setting something up. This does indeed show that we also have to invest our own European satellite navigation system. We must have this technology in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need the know-how in order to build systems such as these independently in Europe and we also have to do something for the owners of our medium-sized enterprises, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will then, if the infrastructure has been set up, benefit from this by developing the applications in many sectors, to which we perhaps do not give much thought at all today: in the logistics sector, in the road haulage sector, in maritime, rail and air transport and in the security field. There are so many applications and I hope that we have done some good preparatory work today on behalf of the owners of our medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">Galileo has a long history. I do not want to repeat it; I would merely like to emphasise that Parliament is backing the Galileo project all the way. Last year we secured the funding on the European tax revenue and with tomorrow’s vote we shall be making an important contribution to ensuring that the project management runs smoothly here, that the management process is transparent in design and that we as Parliament, as co-legislators in Europe, are involved in the further development and management of this project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Galileo could also be subtitled ‘The Neverending Story’. I hope this subtitle will no longer be an issue after today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote. The neverending story is now becoming reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky specifically for her helpful cooperation, not only in the trialogue negotiations, but also in recent years. She has always been a fair partner and we have found reasonable and sound compromises. Thank you also, of course, to the Presidency and specifically to the representative of the Presidency, who has been conducting the five trialogue negotiations with us. A highly competent, committed woman who, it is safe to say, had quite simply – I suspect – not found this compromise in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has always backed the Galileo Project and we are now also backing the result that has been established. I can assure you that there will be no dissenting votes tomorrow from our group and we shall all be voting in favour of it. We must also register the fact – and I would ask you to register this just once more, and it must not appear in the Minutes – that some of the German representatives had to lead the battle with their own government in order to get this going. Mrs Niebler is smiling because she knows what I am talking about.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have managed with this regulation to define clear structures, to find clear responsibility between the Commission, the Supervisory Authority and the ESA. We have the Interinstitutional Panel, on which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have witnessed the progress of this project. We shall be meeting four times a year until 2013 and we all assume that 2013 is a date that we shall likewise be keeping to, and that we shall also be keeping to the budget of 3.4 billion, otherwise it will become difficult to argue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Galileo is – as my fellow Member Mrs Niebler has just stated – not only a satellite navigation system, which enables some citizens perhaps to arrive more quickly at their destination. Galileo is an important technological development for us in Europe and we must maintain our know-how in astronautics, in navigation technology and in electronics. It is therefore important for us to carry out this project here.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is now particularly important that the Commission finalises the call for tenders before the summer. This will be a very difficult task. There will be a decisive settlement. We must give the industry a second chance and the industry must grasp this second chance. I hope that the industry representatives know what is in store for them. We cannot afford a second failure as a result of industry difficulties. I am very anxious about the proposal, the Commission’s action plan and above all about the financial perspective from 2014.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us in conclusion together assert once again: the PPP is therefore not ultimately washed up. As from 2013/2014 we shall be able to apply the PPP again when using the model. I would not now want to write the PPP off entirely.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Minister, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, for experts in the aerospace sector, the name Galileo may conjure up not only an Italian astronomer, but a US space probe designed by NASA to study Jupiter and its dunes, due to be launched on 18 October 1989 from the Atlantis space shuttle. This launch was significantly delayed following a freeze on shuttle flights after the Challenger accident.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ultimately, the success of the Galileo mission within the Jupiter system was spectacular. There are similarities with the European Galileo programme. The programme has experienced setbacks. However, I hope that our programme will prove just as successful. What I hope for above all is that from now on, the name Galileo will be associated with the success of the European programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thinking back to the difficult times linked with the failure of the public-private partnership, we need to join forces to get this project off the ground. The European Parliament wanted to learn from the mistakes of the past and to assume its responsibilities as joint budgetary authority. The fact that the European Parliament has finally agreed to keeping a supervisory authority seems important. Expert supervision is in fact necessary, particularly because the Galileo programme is a first for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the first time that the European Union has invested in its own infrastructure. The European Commission will be owner and the European Space Agency will be manager. These responsibilities must be clearly defined and allocated, but also properly monitored. Since Parliament is closely involved in the project, it seems only right that it should be involved in supervising the programme. Therefore, I welcome the creation of this Interinstitutional Monitoring Group, which will be composed of representatives from Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and will allow each institution, particularly ours, to take ownership of the project. The project must succeed. The credibility of the European Union on the international stage and, more importantly, with its citizens, depends on it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To achieve this, I believe that the ESA must rely on the network of European experts, surround itself with the necessary expertise. It will be a case of coordinating the companies building the various parts, to ensure the system’s safety and to control costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to take the liberty of mentioning a personal view concerning the military use of Galileo. The European Parliament has been forced to severely curtail the possibilities of military use. This is a shame, although perhaps once the programme has matured, it will show that there is a place for careful military use of this tool. Galileo made scientific advances, but also indirectly brought about progress in philosophy and other areas of thinking. Galileo will have huge implications in terms of application, in terms of the independence of our continent, but also in terms of the commitment of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for having such an open attitude, including all those of us who have participated in the process.</p>
      <p sl="es">The last Galileo project, with private investment, failed, and we are now looking at a project that has solely European funding. This means greater social responsibility for the project.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect we can welcome the fact that Galileo is committing to offering a high-quality service at fair prices; fair prices, to ensure that the public investment benefits citizens, so that they do not have to pay twice for the future services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Something else that is very positive is the fact that Galileo will have to be interoperable with the current United States GPS system; that it is learning from this line of interoperable services.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also important that protection of personal data and the right to privacy are technically incorporated into Galileo. In short, Galileo has a new lease of life. We hope to take advantage of this opportunity to offer useful and innovative services to all the people of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a shadow rapporteur I am very glad that we have solved the main problems that were hindering the implementation of the Galileo system. I would like to stress the importance of the contribution by Mrs Barsi-Pataky, whose expertise and diplomatic tact helped to negotiate the renewed referral. I am saying this too as a participant in the trialogue with the Council and the Commission that was led, in my opinion with great success, by Mrs Niebler on behalf of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This is not my first time speaking here about Galileo. Like before, I do not deny that this is a project that is not only ambitious and costly, but also – or exactly for that reason – controversial for several of my colleagues in my group. Drawing on my experience with cosmonautics, I myself am still convinced that we in Europe are going in the right direction. However, the best argument in favour will definitely be for Galileo to function as quickly and as successfully as possible. After the attempt to rely on a consortium of private companies had failed, a prudent solution was eventually reached. Were we in Europe expected to deprive ourselves of the chance to be at the cutting edge of technology? Were we supposed to say no to the possibility of an increase in manufacturing productivity, enhanced safety of all types of transport, fuel savings, faster handling of industrial and other disasters, and other advantages that Galileo offers? I am convinced that the answer is no.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The text in question also provides answers to frequent questions, for example on protection of personal data and privacy, or on guarantees of fair economic competition. It also refers to small and medium-sized enterprises, which should be awarded at least 40% of subcontracted work. Galileo is not cheap but on the other hand it should provide approximately 140 000 new jobs in the EU Member States. I am convinced that when Galileo is up and running, the private sector will come back and will also want to profit from the project. In conclusion, I have already invited the authority that manages Galileo to visit us in Prague. We are still interested and the invitation still stands. The Czech Republic, one of the smaller countries in the Union, sees the Galileo project as an opportunity for the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let us be honest. The EU satellite radio navigation programmes are an unmitigated disaster. The private sector has been quick to spot the pig in a poke and has shown Galileo a clean pair of heels. But is the EU prepared to accept the obvious and abandon the project? No, far from it. Instead, we have this report, which advocates not only that the project should go charging ahead, but that the European taxpayer should pick up the entire cost. It asks for, in this case, a massive increase in the budget, from GBP 120 million to GBP 715 million. In other words, we are seeing the beginning of an open-cheque-book situation for this shameful project.</p>
      <p sl="de">The United States has its own satellite system, GPS, and therefore the EU must have one as well; this is the guiding principle behind Galileo. It is kindergarten policy-making which defies common sense, has no credible economic justification and is morally and environmentally corrupt.</p>
      <p sl="de">This institution spends a great deal of time discussing the environment and bringing forward hair-shirt measures designed to force people living in Europe into a kind of permanent guilt-ridden existence over their carbon footprint. Yet here we are pushing forward a project whose impact on the environment will be almost beyond calculation. Has anyone stopped to consider the carbon footprint of launching into orbit the 30 satellites required by the Galileo system, which will require the burning of massive amounts of rocket engine propellant? The EU’s environmental credentials are already highly questionable, because of the depredations of the CFP and the CAP, not to mention the unnecessary provisions of Parliament’s two buildings, here and in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call upon all Members here today, especially those who see themselves as environmental warriors, to examine their conscience and to oppose this colossal white elephant. We do not need to duplicate facilities already available from the American GPS, and we certainly should not inflict so much unnecessary carbon pollutant upon this environment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">To begin, allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, who has long been active in this area and has made a considerable contribution to the joint decisions and agreements on the successful implementation of the Galileo programme.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my speech I would like to stress two important aspects that are vital for the successful implementation of the European satellite radionavigation programmes. I very much welcome the joint agreement and the decision on the budget for these programmes and the fact that additional funds were found after the Public-Private Partnership model of financing the Galileo programme had fallen through. I think that this was a very responsible and rational decision by all the European institutions. We saw this as a very positive development in our Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think that the European Union must, using its public resources, participate in such programmes and in the development of this sector, which has significant potential for the development of new services with high added value, which are needed in almost all areas of society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The second aspect in the implementation of the programmes is the procurement process during the Galileo development phase. Here, too, I want to express my satisfaction with the proposals for a balanced participation on all levels, including the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Equally, the division of the procurement of infrastructure into six main work packages, as well as a number of additional work packages, will give more suppliers the opportunity to participate in public procurement, which can only enhance the entire implementation process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I want to take this opportunity to call on all the relevant institutions, at both European and national level, to launch a high-profile promotional campaign to ensure that all the relevant stakeholders are involved both during the development phase and once the Galileo system is operational.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am one of those who was present at the start of the Galileo project, and so I am perhaps rather better placed to gauge the extent of the delay. I believe that this project has two inherent defects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, it is the first major Community project of industrial interventionism. It has not been easy to persuade people that the EU could own a satellite navigation system, and it therefore took a long time to obtain a political consensus. Secondly, the business plan could not be how it was imagined initially, simply because GPS, our major competitor, is free and is fully financed by the US government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We needed to overcome these two initial problems and take stock of the situation, spurred on by the Slovenian presidency and by Mr Barrot, before establishing a remarkable consensus between the three institutions. This tripartite dialogue has brought us to a point where we now have a document and a text. Tomorrow will see the launch of Galileo, before the second satellite is launched on Saturday from Baikonur.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is a great deal of euphoria regarding Galileo. However, there are two enormous downers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the high costs, which EU taxpayers are taking on almost exclusively in the meantime. The talk is of at least EUR 3.4 billion, but it will certainly be even more.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the foreseeable military use of Galileo. Galileo has always been promoted as the civilian alternative to GPS. Its exclusively civilian use has even been agreed by contract. Funding now being planned in the EU budget does not allow any military use according to the contracts in force. Some are therefore waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon, which would make this possible, but which will hopefully be rejected by referendum in Ireland. Military use was planned long ago, however. Here we are hoping for funds to be made available for Galileo from the armaments sector. The fourth function of Galileo, to offer a public regulated service, is obviously planned as a dual use for military operations, just as for the police, coast guards and intelligence services. Please say something about this!</p>
      <p sl="de">Nobody needs a second military satellite programme unless it is used for EU geostrategic and military interests. Therefore, Galileo should simply be a civilian project.</p>

      <p sl="sl">() It would be difficult to find a European programme which would pursue the objectives of the Lisbon strategy as well as the activities within the framework of the European Global Navigation Satellite System do. These include research and development work in the area of highly sophisticated technologies, creation of new possibilities for the young, new and better jobs, development of enterprise, and I could go on …</p>
      <p sl="sl">The implementation of the system is so demanding that no Member State could carry it out on its own. This is precisely where the added value of European integration is clearly evident. Also, implementation of the system provides Europe with greater independence, as well as a competitive advantage.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Until only recently, the project was practically buried because of the difficulties with funding. I therefore congratulate Etelka Barsi-Pataky, the rapporteur, and the head of the European Parliament’s negotiating team, Angelika Niebler, who did an excellent job. I would also like to congratulate the Slovene Presidency of the European Council for the latter’s agreement with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, implementation is now running several years late. I would wish for the next stages, involving concrete activities, to be completed as soon as possible, and I appeal for this to be the case. The purpose of the system is performance of the most demanding and diverse applications. I know that in some Member States the feasible applications are already part of existing political strategies. In Slovenia, for instance, an action plan for free-flow tolling has been adopted, and I hope that we shall use the European satellites rather than those of other countries for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, we also have to establish a Supervisory Authority and its headquarters. The Member States should remember the Council decision of 2003, and they should award the Authority’s headquarters to one of the new Member States that have no European institutions as yet. One such candidate is Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This candidate’s proposal has substantial support and, in the hope that it will be successful, it has been carefully and thoroughly prepared.</p>

It is also a platform for multiple services in the future that now we can only imagine.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky, the rapporteur, for her will to help launch it and to ensure its continuation through monitoring, through this interinstitutional group that I think is a very positive innovation which maybe can be adopted for other matters.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wish to drop a few more flies into the ointment. After the major crisis we now have a good and balanced proposal for a regulation, which in my view will secure the construction phase. To do this, however, we should not run over the agenda. The project has been put back five years, with the operating phase planned to begin in 2013. Our industrial policy strategy is therefore failing, as regards being ahead of GPS 3 on the market with Galileo and setting the standards worldwide. I therefore believe that we still need a detailed analysis of the crisis the Commission itself has created, because we have to learn from the breakdown of the PPP model, since another PPP model is available with Caesar.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now no longer have any competitive edge with Galileo, so marketing the system is clearly becoming more difficult. For this reason we must have a discussion in sufficient time about the public costs of the operating phase after 2013 and we should concentrate on how we can establish publicly funded systems for Galileo such as tolls, eCall and Caesar. Finally, we are now already in need of a programme for the combined use of Galileo and GPS signals. We have to concentrate on this because therein lies the added value.</p>

      <p sl="fr">More than any other project, Galileo reflects Community spirit rather than national egos. The idea of funding based on national contributions, albeit even partially, was not a good idea. Fortunately today this argument has been settled in favour of complete financing from the Community budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the European Commission for finding an alternative solution in the absence of an agreement between companies, and for working on a proposal to allocate contracts in a way that would federate all the member states and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we finally have financial transparency. It is fortunate that our institution and the Council are ready to agree without delay.

With this amended report, we will arm ourselves with the tools for success based on a joint decision. Our new goal when building this global navigation system must be to look beyond the complexity of the regulations, the new architecture, clarified responsibilities and new governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Doing this could avoid adding to the existing five-year delay. We have a collective responsibility to monitor its actual application and to engage in and instigate market capture by aiding its development.

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to concentrate on the question of the site of the headquarters of the Galileo European GNSS Supervisory Authority. My answer is that the Czech Republic is the best-prepared country and, in addition to that, it is a Member State in which no European agency is yet based. Prague is strategically placed in the heart of Europe and the building suggested for the new headquarters currently houses the Ministry of Informatics in the former military zone in Klecany. Apart from that, the Czech Republic is a country that has a high level of security and whose science and research is at least comparable to the developed countries of the European Union. A project researching four applications of the system to railways, roads, airports and the transportation of dangerous goods has been up and running in the Czech Republic since 2001. The Czech Technical University in Prague is coordinating a project on a ground receiver, which would be compatible with both the American and the Russian navigation systems. In addition to that, Prague is also a well-established and beautiful European congress destination.</p>

It is a powerful tool that will enable the EU to play an important role in the international arena.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As regards the draft presented today, it should be remembered that Parliament introduced a very clear division of tasks and established the distribution of responsibility between the European Commission, the European Satellite Navigation System supervisory authority and the European Space Agency. The Commission is supposed to be responsible for project management only, while all actions and tasks undertaken by the GSA and ESA are to be implemented outside the scope of the Commission’s competence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, Parliament has made it very clear that in future no delays will be tolerated, and the setting up of the Galileo Interinstitutional Panel will contribute to this.

      <p sl="de">We need a functioning Galileo system as soon as possible and, what is more, our own European system. We have dozens of tasks that we want to handle with this system. We want to control our traffic flows more effectively, whether on the road or on water, and we also want to organise our air traffic in such a way that we save as much energy here as possible through better organisation, thus doing what is sensible to slow down climate change.</p>

We must also, however, take very critical account of the concerns that Mr Pflüger, for example, has expressed.

It will therefore be good when we are able to compare this with something.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is particularly good and important that this system is being adopted on a massive scale when imposing tolls on heavy goods vehicles and when shifting traffic flows from road to rail because there are so many possibilities associated with it.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, evidently the text that you will be adopting will allow the European Union to meet the challenge of developing one of the major technologies of this century.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would particularly like to thank everyone who contributed to this success here in Parliament. Firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky who, on the committee chaired by Mrs Niebler – and I also thank Mrs Niebler for her decisive role in the conclusion of the tripartite dialogue – never stopped believing in Galileo while continuing to set high standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and Mr Böge, who is not here today. Mr Skynas was rapporteur though, since at the time we needed Parliament’s support to secure funding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Jensen, thank you for being such an ardent supporter of Galileo on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. As Mrs Niebler said, this is a good day for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I cannot reply to all the speakers. I have listened to them carefully, I have taken notes. What I would like to say is that we must now approach our SMEs in all of the Member States so that these preparations can be implemented and we can finalise Galileo’s applications. I will have the chance to return before you to describe all of these applications, which include transport as well as civil protection. In any event, Galileo will be much more effective than the current GPS.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to reiterate my ambition to bring the Interinstitutional Monitoring Group into being, which is another way of galvanising our institutions on this project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would now like to tell you a bit about the work that awaits us. Thanks to the EP vote, we now have a budget, a legal basis, clear governance and a procurement plan. This plan was not easy, since the aim was to divide the work between all the major aerospace companies in our Member States, while at the same time organising the subcontracting that many of you quite rightly called for. Our SMEs must also be involved in the construction process. This is why we set aside 40% for subcontracting in the procurement plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will sign an agreement with the European Space Agency. We hope that this will be done before the summer and that we can issue calls for proposals for the six main work packages which have been identified. We would like to be able to sign contracts at the end of the year, so that construction can start on the satellites and the satellite system as soon as possible after the start of next year. The construction of the remaining 26 satellites will take between two and three years. It will then be another one or two years before the launch. Therefore, the Galileo roadmap needs to be very carefully followed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that the engineers and technicians are working very hard. As Mr Savary said earlier, I am pleased to announce that the second Galileo satellite, Giove-B, will be launched from a Soyuz launch vehicle in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at 0.15 a.m. this Sunday, 27 April 2008 (4.15 a.m. local time). Giove-B is already in Baikonur, where it will undergo final testing before launch day. The satellite should be placed on its final orbit around seven hours after the launch, and it will be controlled directly from the Fucino Control Centre in Italy. We must all hope that Giove-B will be as successful as Giove-A, particularly as Giove-B has all the technology in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Remek, allow me to thank you for being here, because you know what there is in space.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have thanked Parliament extensively, but these are not hollow gestures, believe me. I really feel that, if this European project sees the light of day, Parliament will have made an effective contribution. Therefore, I thank you again. Together we will make Galileo succeed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I cannot emphasis enough that European engineers and developers have carried out outstanding work and, as the Vice-President announced, we are awaiting the launch of Giove-B. The European Commission in the person of Vice-President Barrot brought a new proposal for an intensive one-year programme to the table for discussion, and the European Community implemented a new structure and promised the necessary funding. The Galileo programme is ready for its new START, in other words, the project has reached an end. More specifically, we still have many difficult tasks ahead of us. I would emphasise that the GNSS ‘made in Europe’ programme has not been carried out simply in the interests of one or another Member State or one or another industrial concern. In the implementation of this programme, this must always be borne in mind. And finally, Mr President, if you will permit me a personal comment – when the Galileo programme was launched, Hungary, where I was elected in 2004, was not yet a member of the EU, and neither was Slovenia. I am therefore particularly happy that we are cooperating in the new launch on the 27th. Galileo is a very important step in the creation of a strong Europe. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a witness to and participant in the lengthy process of agreeing the financial basis of the Galileo programme, I am following with interest the steps being taken by the European Union to implement this programme. The method of funding, which constitutes a major departure from the original principles, increases our joint responsibility for the success of the programme. The public-private initiative ended in fiasco. We are responsible for the sensible utilisation of European taxpayers’ money, without any risk-sharing with the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the project management system is of such importance. It is appropriate to have a clear statement, as contained in the draft report, that the European Community is the sole owner of all tangible and intangible assets created under the aegis of EGNOS and Galileo. Matters are, unfortunately, moving at a slow pace – 11 years have passed since the European Commission presented its first communication on a European satellite navigation system. Delays have certainly multiplied the cost of this programme and increased the risk to its competitiveness through the appearance of other initiatives on a global scale. The world does not stand still!</p>
      <p sl="en">The purely Community and public nature of the programme justifies the European Parliament’s claims, because of the democratic mandate it holds, for the strengthening of its controlling and operational influence in the preparatory and implementation phase of the Galileo system.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 45 by Manolis Mavrommatis (H-0218/08).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Exchange of information relating to bank accounts</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The recent tax scandal in Liechtenstein had repercussions in many Member States of the EU. According to investigations by the competent authorities, citizens of the Member States are allegedly involved in tax evasion. I am informed that the Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States urged the responsible Directorate-General of the Commission to carry out a rapid investigation and propose a revision of the legal framework to permit the exchange of information relating to citizens' bank accounts.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How will citizens' personal data be protected under such a framework whilst introducing transparency and preventing the transfer and laundering of illicit funds? What procedure will the Commission propose to ensure that the 'opening' of bank accounts is achieved with the greatest respect for legality? In what way is it envisaged that Member States' taxation systems will be harmonised in order to avoid similar situations in the future whereby illicit funds are laundered through bank accounts?</p>

    <intervention id="2-335" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to combat tax evasion. If we do not do this, the basis of our democratic society may erode.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every nation has the right to enact regulations to ensure that taxes are imposed efficiently with the assent of the people’s representatives. Individual measures in this sector, however, frequently do not have the desired effect nationally. International cooperation is therefore required between the tax authorities, involving the exchange of information on bank accounts. The Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States are working together on this at EU level. Some measures have already been introduced at European level. Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments is of particular note here.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the European Union has concluded agreements with third countries, including Liechtenstein, which pursue the same aim as this Directive. These agreements guarantee that interest received and paid to EU citizens in these third countries is liable either to income tax in their own Member State or to deduction at source. Deduction at source can be reimbursed to an individual liable to tax in their Member State of permanent residence if the corresponding income is disclosed for tax purposes.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council carried out an exchange of views on the application of the Directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments on 4 March 2008. As a result of the debate, the Ministers asked the Commission to push ahead with work on a report on the implementation of the Directive since it entered into force on 1 July 2005. The report should address the definition of the terms ‘payment of interest’ and ‘beneficial owners’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question rightly being asked here is to what extent systems for exchanging information are compatible with the protection of personal data. It may be pointed out in this context that the Community rules on data protection, which also apply in the European Economic Area, give Member States the opportunity to take legislative action. This action can restrict those concerned in some of their rights, such as the right of access or the right to information, if this is necessary for the protection of important financial or economic interests of the European Union or of a Member State. This also applies to the areas of finance, budgets and taxation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Comparable restrictions also apply to the effective implementation of the Third Money Laundering Directive. The Member States must at all events reasonably ensure that their competent bodies comply with the appropriate EU regulations and national data protection regulations when supplying and processing personal data.</p>
      <p sl="de">A balance has to be found here between the lawful pursuit of aims in terms of taxation policy and the protection of privacy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, taxation history is full of bogus bank accounts, which are even more harmful when such scandals come to light in European countries.

      <p sl="de">The honourable Member’s question can be answered with a simple no. The systems we currently have are not watertight; we know this. We are therefore making efforts to improve them. Specific regulations to combat money laundering are definitely open to improvement and we are also making efforts in cooperation with European countries that are part of the European Economic Area but not part of the European Union to achieve these respective improvements.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has requested and also received a negotiating mandate from the Council authorising it to negotiate specifically with Liechtenstein with regard to how existing weak spots in the system for combating money laundering and tax fraud can be eliminated. My hope is that the strong public opinion we have witnessed recently in Europe on this issue will help us to reach the necessary agreements. We are working hard on this, but as you know, tax issues are extraordinarily sensitive. Even within the Member States, there is definitely still room for improvement here.</p>

Commissioner, a system has emerged here that continues to benefit those who already ensure that large concerns pay less and less tax and who are now apparently giving up paying tax. I think this a development that cannot be accepted. It would interest me to know what exactly you are negotiating with Liechtenstein and what precisely you want to do to stop these crimes – and I say ‘crimes’ quite deliberately – in future.</p>

    <intervention id="2-341" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">To the first question I should like to reply that it is surely not the Commission’s job to deliver a judgment on which methods a Member State uses to combat tax evasion by its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have pointed out that the general rules also apply in tax matters to the protection of personal data, that the Member States are entitled to restrict these rules if this serves to protect their financial interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think the question you have asked is one that should be put to the German Government. To my knowledge it has investigated the issue of the legality of proceedings in the case you have described in great detail prior to the decision and has reached the conclusion that the German tax authorities were entitled to secure the data involved here.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the second, very general question, I agree with you that it is annoying that we do not have to guarantee the possibility in the existing EU Treaty that tax avoidance and tax evasion will be pursued in the same way everywhere in Europe and that it still cannot be guaranteed that nobody will aid and abet tax evasion or tax avoidance.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have in recent years achieved a great deal, particularly against the background of the necessary battle against money laundering and all forms of international crime and terrorism. I have already pointed out, however, that the Commission believes that there are opportunities for improvement here and what we want to achieve with Liechtenstein – as with other countries – is completely clear. We should like to maintain the same cooperation and the same exchange of information in relation to Liechtenstein as already exists between the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 46 by Saïd El Khadraoui (H-0234/08)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Particulate emissions from mopeds</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Research by Utrecht University has shown that mopeds and scooters are emitting large quantities of fine and ultra-fine dust particulates. The researchers measured emissions absorbed by cyclists and motorists in 12 medium-sized towns. This showed that cyclists were absorbing an excessive quantity of fine particulates when they were close to a moped. It seems that mopeds actually emit more particulates per second than heavy goods vehicles. Directive 2002/51/EClays down emission standards for vehicles of this type. But it does not mention particulates at all.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission aware of the pollution problem from scooters? What will the Commission be doing to deal with the problem in an adequate manner?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-343" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has been advocating the reduction of fine and ultra-fine dust particulates for years now. Since 2005 the Commission has proposed a raft of legislative measures for improving air quality, of which you are aware. As part of the Seventh Framework Research Programme, however, important aspects of an environmentally friendly transport policy are being examined.</p>
      <p sl="de">When laying down standards for vehicle particulate emissions, the Commission concentrated first on diesel cars and commercial vehicles, since the supply of these vehicles was considerably larger than the supply of motorised two-wheelers. We therefore concentrated to begin with on tackling the problem of where they occur in large quantities. Here we have reached some important milestones.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation on emissions from light and commercial vehicles in 2007. These are the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards. They have already been adopted and are coming into force. The additional particulate emissions from diesel vehicles are now being reduced by these Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards from the current 25 milligrams per kilometre to 5 milligrams per kilometre.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the Commission put forward a proposal on 21 December 2007 for a regulation on emissions from heavy commercial vehicles, and this is the Euro VI standard. It reduces the limits for nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% and particulate emissions by 66% compared with the Euro V standard in force today.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem of particulate emissions from two-wheelers essentially arises from two-stroke engines. Particulate emissions from four-stroke engines are very low in comparison, even when they correspond to the Euro 5 standard.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2004 the Commission commissioned a study intended to shed light on whether a legal provision is reasonable for limiting particulate emissions from two-stroke engines. The result of the study was that the particulates discharged from these engines are predominantly hydrocarbons. The limits for hydrocarbon emissions from motorbikes and mopeds – two-wheelers, therefore – were already tightened up here substantially in 2004 and in 2007, and the situation has already improved considerably for new cars. In addition, manufacturers are switching from two-stroke engines to four-stroke engines so that the hydrocarbon limits can generally be maintained. For this reason, the Commission has not put forward any specific measures for limiting particulate emissions from two-wheelers. I must say, however, that the situation is clearly more critical for older vehicles with two-stroke engines emitting hydrocarbons and particulates in larger quantities. These emissions can be significantly reduced, however, if synthetic oil is used for lubricating the engine instead of mineral oil. The Commission therefore supports the corresponding campaign by the Association of European Motorcycle Manufacturers and by the Motorcyclists’ Association. The Commission is nevertheless investigating the need for a revision of the legislative provisions for two- and three-wheeled motor vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="de">A study was commissioned at the beginning of this year, which will examine the findings of the study from 2004, taking account of the latest technical development. The results of this study will be available by the end of this year. If it emerges that a legislative proposal is needed from the Commission – and I am prepared to make one, should it be necessary – then this would take place in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the framework directive on ambient air quality assessment and management and the respective individual directives, which define emission limits for PM10 particulates and for benzene, the Member States must ensure by appropriate measures that the limits are maintained nationally on the appointed date. The Member States must also provide for emergency measures in the event that the limits are temporarily exceeded. In areas in which there is a considerably higher probability of two-stroke motors exceeding the limits, Member States will make allowance for this situation with their respective air quality plans and emergency measures after the Commission has carried out an assessment.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your elaborate response. You rightly referred to the efforts that the Commission has already made in relation to emissions from lorries and vans, yet a legislative proposal has not yet been developed in relation to mopeds. You refer to the industry’s effort to replace two-stroke motors with four-stroke motors, which would bring about a positive development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, I ask myself to what extent this is just a noncommittal agreement. Is this a genuine agreement? Secondly, we must be aware that the pollution is highly localised and, for example, has a major effect on cyclists in the immediate vicinity of mopeds, which constitutes a problem for public health.</p>

      <p sl="de">I understand the honourable Member’s question very well. We are concerned here not with an arrangement with industry brought about by the Commission, as was once the case, for example, with the reduction of CO2 emissions from motor cars, but rather with a sort of automatic development. As I have said, the manufacturers of two-wheelers cannot adhere to the tight limits already in existence for hydrocarbon emissions with conventional two-stroke engines. They are simply not able to. This is the reason why they are switching over to four-stroke engines, which raise a different problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The study I have been talking about will reveal the results of this technical development and I repeat once again: if it were to transpire that the problem about which I have just been speaking could not be resolved automatically, so to speak, then it would in fact be necessary to put forward a legislative proposal. I repeat once again: I am prepared to do this.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 47 by Johan Van Hecke (H-0243/08)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: 2.2 billion children in need</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Worldwide, 2.2 billion children are suffering as a result of poverty, illiteracy, sexual abuse and military conflicts. A child born in sub-Saharan Africa has a one in six chance of dying before age 5. According to the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, more than 27 000 children die each day, mainly from preventable diseases. UNICEF's latest figures show that, worldwide, 93 million children of primary school age do not go to school, including 41 million children in sub-Saharan Africa, 31.5 million in South Asia and 6.9 million in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of the fact that next year is the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, these figures make very sad reading. Will the Commission take tangible steps to combat exploitation of children, whether in the sex industry or in situations where they are used as soldiers? When the Treaty of Lisbon, into which the rights of the child have been incorporated, comes into force, will the Commission have more clout in this area?</p>

    <intervention id="2-347" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission agrees with the analysis by Mr Van Hecke, and I would like to reassure him that the Commission is very active in its efforts to fight child abuse. Children’s rights are among the main priorities of the Commission’s Strategic Objectives for 2005-2009. This priority was expressed in the 2006 Commission communication ‘Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child’, and recently in the Commission communication ‘A Special Place for Children in EU external action’, adopted on 5 February 2008. The aim of the recently adopted communication is to create a framework for a common EU approach to protecting and promoting the rights of the child in third countries, which would be reflected in all areas of our external relations including development assistance, humanitarian aid and trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Action plan on children’s rights in EU external action, included with this communication, identifies the main priority areas requiring action at regional and global level: child labour, child trafficking, violence against children, including sexual violence, and children affected by armed conflicts. In order to implement these policies, the Commission will make use of the EUR 25 million from the thematic programme ‘Investing in people’ to support initiatives in the following areas: child trafficking, children affected by armed conflicts, sexual and reproductive health, and rights of young people. The Commission will continue to support, within the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, projects implementing the EU’s basic principles of supporting and protecting the rights of the child, and the principles concerning children affected by armed conflicts. Although the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified, it is worth mentioning that it stipulates that in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child. In so doing the Union gives priority in its external policy to the issue of human rights of probably the most vulnerable group in society.</p>

However, I would like to bring my question up to date. UNICEF has recently published a report that shows that in the past week in Eastern Congo, 2 to 3 000 children have been kidnapped by militia and are being shamefully misused in military conflict. What more does the Commission think it can do to avoid such situations in the field? I appreciate all efforts and I appreciate what is in the plan of action.

In my opinion, the European Commission’s strategy is coherent and consistent, within the capacity and the legal basis available to the Commission. As regards action on situations that occur locally, I think that it is important to make a decision at the time and in the place where the risk exists, based on the structures available to the Commission and in accordance with the political and organisational options. Therefore, you are right: in order to strengthen the protection of children against similar violence, it is always necessary to make use of the structures and activities that exist where the events occur.</p>

At any rate, as regards the European Commission’s competence, it is up to the Member States to adopt measures that would prevent international adoption from being abused. This, of course, applies to the Republic of Austria, too. I would like to point out that the rules on international adoption are not uniform in all respects across the European Union, and that each country adopts its own national rules within the framework of international child protection conventions; these national rules could be changed and improved in various ways. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to repeat that in principle international adoption gives many children the opportunity to find a family and a normal life; on the other hand, however, it is a very sensitive area and it falls within the remit of the Member States.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-355" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is aware of the demographic issues facing the pension systems. Because the birth rate has been decreasing since the 1970s and because people live longer, an ever-smaller number of people of working age will have to support a ever-larger number of people who are outside working age. As you know, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, social protection falls within the remit of the Member States. The Commission therefore does not intervene in the Member States’ pension systems, nor does it even have an advisory role in relation to national adjustments. That is why the Member States and the Commission agreed to cooperate in the area of social protection and social inclusion, on the basis of the open method of coordination, which means that the Commission and the Council set up joint goals, the Member States report on these goals and the Commission compiles its findings in the report that is consequently adopted by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Member States submitted the first set of national strategic reports in 2002, and the second set in 2005. This second set was summed up by the Commission in the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion, adopted by the Council of Europe in 2006. The evaluation shows that although the recent reforms have resulted in more emphatic incentives for people to work longer, there is still the need for further measures to achieve higher employment rates, in particular among women and older workers. Achieving higher employment rates is the best way to ensure that pension systems remain adequate and sustainable. In Greece the risks of old-age poverty are significantly higher than the average: 26% in 2005 for persons over 65 years of age, compared with 19% for persons aged 64. The Greek pension system needs to be reformed to make it more appropriate and more sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Reforms are needed to encourage older people and women to work more and longer. Considering the low participation of women, we need to implement policies aiming at achieving higher employment rates among women in order to ensure that pension systems are adequate and sustainable in the long term. Since pension systems already wrestle with financial difficulties now, poverty among the elderly will continue to be a problem in the future until such time as those who are not involved in the basic pension system gain the right to claim a pension after a longer period of time.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is expected that the next set of national strategic reports will be prepared in 2008. The Commission will draw up a summary of the main developments in the Member States. This will provide the basis for the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion that will be presented in 2009.</p>

Now let me touch on the subject of the early retirement of mothers on the grounds that they have children who are still minors when they retire. The threshold for early retirement used to be at 50 years in Greece; it has been raised for future generations to the age of 55, but not of this case of mothers with children.

      <p sl="cs">As I mentioned at the start, under the Treaty establishing the European Community the overall structure of pension systems is the responsibility of the individual Member States and falls under their remit. The Member States have different methods for setting the retirement age. The most common age is 65 years but there are countries where the retirement age is higher, just as there are countries where it is lower. The same applies to pensions for women: different retirement ages are set on the basis of decisions and political debates in the individual Member States. The basic principle advocated by the Commission, and enshrined in the Treaty, is that these systems must not discriminate in any way. Once this condition has been met, it is fully the responsibility of the Member States to set the retirement age. This is why I do not want to comment in detail on the different retirement ages in individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is alarmed at the high unemployment rate among young people in the Member States, which was 15.2% at the end of 2007, i.e. almost double the overall unemployment rate. The Commission is also alarmed at the persistence of long-term unemployment, affecting approximately half (45%) of all unemployed people, although I must stress that we have witnessed a considerable decrease in long-term unemployment in recent times. This decrease varies from Member State to Member State but we there is certainly a downtrend across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, the situation is still worrying. Many young people finish their education without gaining the skills needed to enter the job market. This is because approximately one in six young people in the European Union drops out of school early and one in four does not complete secondary education.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In spite of significant efforts by Member States to improve the employment rate among young people, approximately half of the countries have not yet reached the goal of giving the young unemployed the chance of a ‘new start’ within six months, which was the stipulation for 2007, or within four months, which is the objective for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Member States are primarily responsible for implementing measures to reduce the youth unemployment rate and long-term unemployment. The European Union has a complementary role through coordination of the Member States’s national employment policies and through financial support under the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As you are aware, each year the Commission adopts its annual progress report on the employment strategy At its meeting in March 2008, the European Council adopted a number of recommendations to the Member States: 17 of them were recommendations in the area of education and professional training, and 15 in the area of employment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that there are three courses of action that are vital for improving the integration of young people in the labour market:</p>
      <p sl="cs">1. Improving education and training: it is important to concentrate efforts on developing key skills in childhood and on creating a support mechanism to prevent young people from dropping out of school early. The Lifelong Learning Programme, in operation since 2007, contributes to the development of the European Union as an advanced knowledge-based society by providing support for the modernisation and adjustment of education systems and professional training in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">2. Supporting social inclusion: in this context, particular attention should be paid to improving the situation of the most vulnerable young people and to eradicating child poverty.</p>
      <p sl="cs">3. Improving geographical mobility: at present unemployment sits alongside a shortage of labour on the job markets. This has prompted the Commission to support cooperation between the Member States, and in particular to encourage greater mobility of young people in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In implementing their labour market policies, the Member States also receive financial assistance under the Structural Funds, and in particular from the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Member States have EUR 75 billion at their disposal for the period 2007-2013. The European Social Fund is extremely important. Approximately 25% of unemployed people in the European Union were in some way involved in ESF projects in 2007. This means that each year assistance is provided to approximately 1 million people suffering from exclusion, including young people. Each year approximately 2 million people enter the labour market after having received assistance from the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Although the European Regional Development Fund does not concentrate on young people per se, it cofinances projects that directly involve young people, such as infrastructure for education and professional training, university research, and support for businesses, notably small and medium-sized enterprises. Under the Regions for Economic Change initiative the Commission supports an exchange of best practice through the regional network ‘Integrating marginalised youth’.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the fight against youth unemployment and against long-term unemployment is a priority for Europe and for the Member States. Integrating young people into working life and into society and making better use of their potential are the main preconditions for the reviving strong and sustainable growth in Europe.</p>

This is a typical and ideal opportunity to compare the various approaches of individual Member States. You are right: some Member States are quicker and more efficient in finding solutions for some questions than others.

At present, the Commission is concentrating, in particular through the work done by my colleague Commissioner Figeľ, on the early drop-out rates and the acquisition of basic skills. You are right: it is vital that people acquire the basic skills and the ability to learn in early childhood and adolescence because it makes it easier for them to pursue their careers with more ease and success later on in life. Under our programmes, such as those financed by the European Social Fund, we concentrate on something that I would call a ‘second chance’, in other words giving children who have had problems (and there are quite a few of them) the opportunity to go back to the formal structures and complete their education. This is one of the Commission’s focal points because, as already mentioned, it is a crucial matter.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 50 by Robert Evans (H-0185/08)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU anti-discrimination legislation</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Under current EU legislation, it is only in the field of employment and vocational training that EU citizens are protected against discrimination on grounds of age, religion or belief, disability and sexual orientation, whilst in the fields of education, social protection and access to goods and services, discrimination legislation only applies on grounds of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As legislation is broadened to include more categories in the goods and services field, what consideration has the Commission given to the unintended consequences this may cause?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">For example, in any new legislation, what safeguards has the Commission considered to ensure that reductions for elderly people and concessionary groups are not adversely affected?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-366" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has established a broad framework for the fight against discrimination and can be proud of the results that have been achieved. However, some groups enjoy a higher level of protection than others. Specifically this means that people are protected against discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation or religion but it is only in the workplace that they are protected in this complex manner. Only the scope of protection against discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin and gender is wider.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As announced in the Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008, the Commission is planning a proposal for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, implementing the principle of equal treatment outside employment and broadening the existing EU legal framework. The decisions on the details have yet to be made: for example, we are awaiting the results of an impact study that is currently being carried out and these results will be available soon. However, the Commission understands the need to achieve the balance the principles of non-discrimination and preferential treatment; under certain circumstances the latter may be justified.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Several types of preferential treatment exist in the Member States and they offer special treatment to certain groups for specific reasons without being discriminatory. An example of preferential treatment is free travel on public transport for older people: this supports mobility. The Commission does not deem these practices illegal if they have a legitimate basis in national law for social, educational, cultural or other reasons.</p>

I thank him for that assurance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The existing Directives provide for special regulations concerning religious communities and religious beliefs. In this context, when monitoring the measures the Commission also monitors the implementation of the regulations. This is a complex and extremely sensitive matter but, generally speaking, it is regulated under the European Directives and the Commission can judge whether or not individual Member States are implementing the legislation correctly or breaching the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I can give a very simple answer to the other question. The principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination is a fundamental European value that must be implemented, and when implementing it we have to make use of all the instruments available to the European Union. On the other hand, it is clear that when making decisions that are so significant for so many, we need to study the consequences and we need impact assessments. The European Commission applies this method rigorously in all areas, including the area of equal opportunities, fundamental rights and non-discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission is monitoring the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement. The figures concerning the first year of implementation of this agreement are not yet final since the first year only ended on 28 February 2008 and there is a six-month delay between the time that fishing operations take place and when the data are transmitted and analysed. Despite this time delay, the figures that we already have in our possession indicate the positive views of the fishing possibilities that show a utilisation rate of around 80% of the total fishing possibilities.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-376" speaker_id="1337" name="Manuel Medina Ortega" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">I thank the Commissioner for his response and acknowledge that it is difficult to have data so soon, but as I happen to live near the area where the fishing is done, the fishermen have told me that there are some structural problems in this fishing ground as a result of the excessive appearance of nets and other fishing gear that has been abandoned in the area, which make fishing extremely difficult.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not know whether the Commissioner is aware of the structural difficulties that have arisen in the Saharan fishing ground since the last agreement. This was a period during which the European fishing fleet was not present, but apparently this has caused a deterioration of fishing conditions as a result of a lack of conservation of the ground.</p>

    <intervention id="2-377" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joe Borg" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">If I can be a little more precise, during the first year of implementation for the main categories, more than 90% for small-scale categories and tuna have been fished, and around 80% for industrial pelagics.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the utilisation rate for the demersals is much worse. In this regard it is only about 23% utilisation. This is attributable mainly to certain problems that you have indicated, in particular the question concerning compulsory landings on the insistence of Morocco which was included in the fisheries partnership agreement, and also the problem regarding the recruitment of Moroccan seamen on board Community vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was in Morocco myself around two weeks ago and I had the occasion to discuss with the Moroccan Minister these teething problems – as one may call them – with regard to the implementation of the fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco. I think that there is a general understanding that we need to revisit the question concerning compulsory landings, given that in the fisheries partnership agreement the intention was that these landings would be required for re-exportation purposes. Community vessels would be required to land fish that was caught in Morocco and they would be re-exported after processing.</p>
      <p sl="en">In actual fact the landing of fish is now being utilised for local consumption. That means that since the fish are caught outside the territorial limit they are considered to be imported into Morocco and therefore there is a hefty duty being charged.</p>
      <p sl="en">I raised this issue and there is understanding, and I hope that in the very short-term we will find a solution to it. In a similar way with regard to the recruitment of Moroccan seamen, we have raised this issue with the Moroccan authorities – with the Minister himself – and there has been a widening of the list of persons that are included and from which the European Community vessel owners can choose.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are trying to expand this list further so that in that way we will try to lessen as much as possible the inconvenience of a very restricted list of persons from which the vessel owners can chose fishers to operate on board their vessels.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s number one concern is the safety of the Spanish fishermen on board. It goes on to say that it deplores all acts of piracy and armed robbery. The maintenance of security in the waters off the coast of Somalia cannot be adequately ensured by the Somali authorities. As a result, there is a serious problem with piracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It concludes by saying that the Commission is of the view that a coordinated approach to the protection of EU merchant and fishing vessels cruising in unsecured maritime zones might legitimately form part of a European maritime policy, but it also relates to European security and defence policy.

      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission aware of the establishment of the Small Boat Fishermen's Association in the UK following the fishing quotas imposed this year? Is the Commission aware that these new quotas for some areas of the UK has meant some small fleets can only catch one cod per boat each day? Although it is up to the UK Government to decide on the distribution of the fishing quotas amongst large and small boats, does the Commission recognise the local and traditional importance of small fleets, some of which have received sustainability awards? Does it believe more should be done in Europe to protect them? If so, how?</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the honourable Member, Ms Bowles, for her question, which gives me the opportunity to express the Commission’s position concerning the important issue of small-scale vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am aware of the creation of an association bringing together owners of vessels under 10 metres long in the UK fleet. I am also aware that the low cod quota allocation is at the root of this association, since the share of the UK’s cod quota for this part of the fleet is only about 3% of the total, despite the fact that the relative catch potential of this part of the fleet may be considerably larger.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you rightly pointed out in your question, Member States – in this case the United Kingdom – are responsible for distributing fishing opportunities amongst their vessels. I would, furthermore, like to add that Member States are also responsible for adjusting the size of the fleet, whether it is made up of small or large vessels, to the fishing opportunities available to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline that the Commission does recognise the specific circumstances of small-scale fleets, more precisely of vessels with a length of under 12 metres that do not use towed gear. For this part of the fleet, the European Fisheries Fund provides a very favourable financial framework, which allows Member States to adopt measures to protect it.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, I would like to point out that, on the basis of the information I have concerning vessels of under 10 metres in the UK, there are indications that this fleet sector has recently developed a harvesting capacity well beyond the fishing opportunities that were traditionally allocated to it. The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">If that is the case, then the fishermen from the south-east coast of England will become even more irritated by being told they cannot catch cod that theoretically do not exist, although, in fact, the supply there is quite plentiful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could you resolve this for me and let me know to what extent the cod in the Channel have been taken into account in the latest EU statistics? I appreciate you may not come with all this information prepared, so I will accept it in writing if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="en">I presented a proposal for a new cod recovery plan in Council on Monday of last week, when we held an initial exchange of views on the plan, which is also intended to cover the Irish Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, we are extending the reach of the cod recovery plan further. However, we are trying to fine-tune it to make it more sensitive to the particular realities found in the different waters, so that if there is a particular area of Community waters where cod stocks are more plentiful, then certain measures can be taken. In other areas, where cod stocks are in much worse shape, more stringent measures are obviously needed in order to give stocks a chance to recover.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cod stocks in general are in very bad shape. I think they are among the worst as regards mortality, and very tough measures are therefore needed to enable these very valuable stocks to recover.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Honourable Member, Mr Ó Neachtain, for his question, which gives me the opportunity to address the issue of the decommissioning of fishing vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">By letter dated 6 August 2007, the Irish authorities notified the Commission of the state aid scheme entitled ‘Adjustment of fishing effort’. The scheme foresees the decommissioning of vessels registered in the polyvalent or beam-trawl segments of the Irish fleet, primarily targeting white fish stocks, although vessels targeting pelagic and shellfish stocks are also included. The overall national budget for the scheme is EUR 66 million. The Commission approved the scheme under state aid rules on 13 November 2007. The Irish scheme foresees that aid can be granted until 1 October 2009. However, according to the Irish authorities, the closing date for applications under the scheme is 30 April 2008, after which date the level of uptake of the scheme will be clearer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the initiative taken by Ireland in seeking to reduce its fishing fleet capacity so as to lessen the pressure on existing fish stocks. Matching fishing capacity to fishing opportunities is a central pillar of the common fisheries policy. Moreover, the Irish scheme gives priority to the decommissioning of those vessels targeting sensitive white fish stocks, while giving vessel owners already facing reduced quotas, higher fuel costs etc. the opportunity to leave the sector. The remaining operators should benefit from more attractive returns.</p>

      <p sl="ga">However, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission has any plans or proposals that will provide those from the fishery sector who have lost their jobs with the opportunity of finding another career and possibly remain in a similar line of work?

      <p sl="en">With regard to the crew members of vessels to be decommissioned, I would like to say first of all that the European Fisheries Fund allows assistance for the permanent cessation associated with decommissioning. However, it is up to the Member State concerned whether to include this item of expenditure within its operational programme for the European Fisheries Fund. I understand that Ireland considers that the national state benefit scheme provides compensation for the crews.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, apart from the permanent cessation associated with decommissioning, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) also provides the possibility of socioeconomic compensation, diversification, retraining and early retirement. So it is also possible to provide assistance under the EFF in order to retrain crew for different, although related, sectors, providing opportunities for diversification and for seeking alternative employment in other sectors as well. Again, I would stress that it is the Member State which has to draw up the operational programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will approve the operational programme as long as it conforms to the parameters of the European Fisheries Fund, but the actual priorities, the actual areas that are identified, are up to the Member State concerned. The Commission does not have the right to insist that Member States should opt for one rather than the other. As long as they are included within the objectives or the aims of the European Fisheries Fund, then that is good enough for us.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Serious infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy in 2005</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1447/1999, the Member States are required to report annually to the Commission any infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP) and the related fines imposed. Recently, the Commission published the sixth report on serious infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy (COM(2007)0448).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The data published in the report reveal that the number of infringements is rising whereas the fines imposed throughout the EU are diminishing. In specific terms, in 2005, 8.1% more infringements were recorded while the level of sanctions fell by almost 45% compared with 2004. There are also significant differences between Member States as regards the circumstances in which fines are imposed and the level of the fines.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission say whether the various national systems of imposing sanctions guarantee equal competition between European fishermen? Does the Commission consider that it would be appropriate to set up a harmonised system of imposing sanctions for serious infringements of the rules of the CFP? How can fishermen's confidence that the rules of the CFP are applied even-handedly be strengthened so that they respect the rules on the conservation of fish stocks?</p>

      <p sl="en">I should like to thank the honourable Member, Mr Gklavakis, for the important question he has raised, thereby providing me with the opportunity to express my position concerning this crucial issue and also to touch on the reform being prepared in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am aware of the significant disparities in the sanctions imposed by Member States for serious infringements, leading to persistent shortcomings in the current control system.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you rightly pointed out in your question, the penalties imposed by Member States are an insufficient deterrent, providing no real incentive for compliance. To give you an example: the average fine in the European Union in 2005 was less than EUR 2 000, varying from EUR 98 in some Member States to EUR 8 876 in others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline that, according to Community law, it is up to the national authorities to ensure that every serious infringement of the common fisheries policy is subject to appropriate follow-up proceedings and, where necessary, to a deterrent penalty. It is the Member States which have the primary responsibility and the discretion to define the amount and to impose the sanctions for serious infringements of the common fisheries policy. The Commission can only supervise and evaluate this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said this, I would like to inform you that, on the basis of the analysis of the Member States’ annual serious infringements reports over the past years, and especially the Court of Auditors’ Report No 7/2007, the Commission has decided to launch a reform of the control system of the common fisheries policy, envisaging the harmonisation of sanctions at Community level, along with a clearer definition of serious infringements, to guarantee uniformity and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that this new, simpler and more effective control regime will ensure a level playing field between Community fishermen by strengthening respect for the common fisheries policy rules and by spreading a culture of compliance.</p>

Let me point out one more thing: the lower marine fish stocks become, the stricter we need to be, or else the future will be very bleak.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Mr Gklavakis for his comments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to appeal to Members of Parliament to support the Commission in this drive in order to try to bring about a measure of harmonisation of the sanctions regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had a first exchange of views in Council only last week on a related area, which is the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. In the IEU proposal, we are trying to harmonise the provisions – the sanctions regime, so to speak. Although all Member States unanimously agree that we need to effectively fight illegal fishing, when it came to discussing the details on the reach of the proposal, on the harmonisation of the sanctions and on how we can see to it to control the importation of illegally processed fish products, I think there was almost unanimity in finding problems with our proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously I will be taking this up with the Member States during the coming months. I envisage that when we come to the whole control regulation – which also encompasses the IEU – it is going to be much more of a tough encounter. I hope that Parliament, in the report that it intends to draw up on the new control proposal, which I will be hopefully presenting to the college for adoption later this year, will give it its full support.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 70 by Giovanna Corda (H-0157/08)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Progression of bluetongue in northern Europe</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A recent study by two Belgian universities demonstrates the high risk of the bluetongue disease becoming endemic in northern Europe. Since the spread of bluetongue is linked to movements of the carriers and strengthening of the viral strains, should we not immediately undertake emergency measures in anticipation of the disease progressing?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In addition, since the total number of cattle herds and sheep flocks affected by the disease increased from 695 in 2006 to 6 857 in 2007 in Belgium alone, would the Commission state what measures it intends to introduce for the development of an antiviral treatment, for vaccination campaigns, and for the financing of the foregoing?</p>

      <p sl="en">I thank the honourable Member for the question. I would say that the Commission is well aware of the unprecedented situation caused by the spread of bluetongue in several Member States in recent years and is making strenuous efforts to combat this disease.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last January, at the Conference on bluetongue vaccination arranged by the Commission, it clearly emerged that vaccination is the main, most effective veterinary measure to combat bluetongue. In order to achieve a harmonised EU approach, the Commission swiftly issued guidelines and criteria for vaccination plans, while leaving the Member States the necessary flexibility to adapt the vaccination strategy to their particular situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission then assessed the plans submitted by the Member States, approved them and ensured a first financial contribution of up to EUR 64 million out of a total of EUR 130 million for the whole exercise. All these actions reflect the importance that the Commission attaches to the vaccination.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Community is also supporting several bluetongue research programmes. Under the fifth and sixth framework programmes, two specific projects were devoted to the development of a safe, efficacious bluetongue virus vaccination strategy. The EU contribution was EUR 1.7 million and EUR 804 000 respectively. These actions will have continuity in the seventh framework programme. However, at present scientists do not consider that the development of anti-viral treatments would effectively reduce the losses caused by this disease.</p>

      <p sl="fr">So, you have given us plenty of information although, according to data compiled recently in the Benelux countries and in Germany, the number of herds infected by the fever has been multiplied by 25 in a year, which is considerable.</p>

Surely that would be a sensible thing to do, so that people – even voluntarily – do not import from an area that has been affected into a region that is unaffected, because it is spreading rapidly. You say that it is inevitable, but I think we should do that.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Brazilian beef</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission make a comprehensive statement outlining the up-to-date position with regard to the substantial restrictions on Brazilian beef imports to the European Union?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-400" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androula Vassiliou" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As you know, the EU has had in place for a number of years a very effective import policy for beef coming from Brazil.</p>
      <p sl="en">Brazilian beef destined for the EU is only authorised from territories which are considered to be free from foot-and-mouth disease. Currently, these territories are located in six Brazilian states: Espírito Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bovine animals whose meat is destined for the EU market must have remained within an authorised territory for at least a 90-day residency period. In addition, there is a minimum 40-day residency period prior to slaughter within a holding.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the slaughterhouse, the bovine animals cannot come into contact with other animals that do not comply with the above conditions and have to undergo an ante-mortem health inspection and show no clinical signs of disease 24 hours prior to slaughter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only fresh beef can be exported to the EU and the beef itself must have been deboned and matured to ensure inactivation of the FMD virus, should it still be present despite all the previously mentioned measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a Commission inspection in November 2007 identified serious instances of non-compliance with regard to holding registration, animal identification and movement control and a failure on the part of Brazil to respect previous commitments to take the appropriate corrective measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consequently, the Commission adopted measures in January this year which restricted imports of Brazilian beef to holdings meeting a number of additional requirements. These additional requirements include the full identification and registration of all animals in the national Brazilian system for bovine animals. In addition, the holdings have to be placed under the effective control of the Brazilian veterinary services and regularly inspected by the Brazilian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">I too welcome the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps my question is a little unfair, because it has a historical perspective. But from your predecessor, Commissioner Kyprianou, I received a reply with regard to the food and veterinary report about six months ago. His response was that the preliminary conclusions of the report did not justify an immediate change of EU policy vis-à-vis Brazil. Just literally two or three months before the ban was imposed, the food and veterinary officials were insisting in the Agriculture Committee and elsewhere that the problems were not really of a significant nature. Yet, within two or three months, the ban was imposed, and now we are just importing from 1% of the original number of farms.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question is: did it take the Irish Farmers Association report to prompt the FVO to look much closely at the situation, and did it take that to cause the Commission to act?</p>

      <p sl="en">However, I believe that we should be fair not just with the regulations that apply to European farmers and food producers, but to those who are importing into the European Union as well and that the same regulations should apply. How do we go about guaranteeing that the food supply is secure and safe to the same standards that European producers are meant to meet, in particular with regard to beef from Brazil?</p>

      <p sl="en">Consequently, as I said, additional requirements were adopted, and at present we are making sure that the Brazilian commitment really is adhered to. At this point in time, experts from the Commission are offering practical training to the inspectors themselves, but are also making sure that the inspectors who have been trained are there in the farms training their own people, so that every Member State receiving exports of beef from Brazil has guarantees that there are well-trained people to supervise adherence to our requirements and regulations.</p>

Your last statement troubles me a little, because the experience of Irish farmers, European farmers, when they are visited by inspectors from the Commission, is not one of great assistance but of inspection and checking.

I wish the same would apply when it comes to our own producers.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second question is: what efforts is Brazil making to raise its game, and can you envisage – and, if so, when – a return, as I am sure the Brazilians wish, to the levels of beef they were previously sending to Europe? I know you are new to the job, but do you believe that their standards, should they ever reach them, are equivalent to ours, given that they only require 90 days and 40 days?

      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, the Commission has every intention to respond to the decision of the Parliament and the Council when removing health services from the Services Directive in 2006 to have them treated separately.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the Commission’s intention to present a proposal that will codify the rulings of the European Court of Justice in this area, thus clarifying patients’ rights in the provision of cross-border health care and to present flanking measures in order to secure the availability of good quality cross-border health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certain concerns expressed on various aspects of this matter in the course of the last few months led to further reflection and consultation. However, a draft proposal for a directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border health care is now under consideration for adoption by the College before the end of June 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our aim is to come forward with a proposal with the ultimate goal of helping citizens to exercise their rights conferred upon them by the European Court of Justice rather than to create more problems. This proposal will be focused on patients’ rights and increased access to health care. It will be part of a social package to be launched in cooperation with Commissioner Špidla, promoting access, opportunities and solidarity for all EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Patients will be the main focus of this initiative and this is in line with the overarching citizen-oriented approach of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal will not create new financial entitlements for patients. The rights of patients established by the Court relate to the financial entitlements already defined by Member States. This proposal simply creates a framework for the patients to exercise these rights effectively with greater legal certainty, more transparency and improved predictability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the proposal will also set the legal and administrative basis for an improved and renewed cooperation between Member States in some forward-looking health-related areas where EU added value and synergies are expected to be decisive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Health care was exempted from the Services Directive originally for very good reasons, because we wanted a health services directive. We have already waited far too long. I am not quite sure what message the shuffling around the different desks in the Commission is sending to us. Is it a concern with too much privatisation? Is it a concern that we might run down health services in Member States? There are already major discrepancies in competences in this area and differences in standards, and under the single market patients are entitled, as the ECJ has decided, to travel for treatment if they cannot reasonably access treatment in their own Member State.

      <p sl="en">Regarding privatisation, there is great concern about this, but my answer is that this concern is unfounded. The proposal is focused on the needs of patients. It ensures that, if patients travel to receive care, it is safe and of good quality. It also makes clear under what conditions citizens can have cross-border health care reimbursed by their national health system or health care provider and when they cannot. These conditions for reimbursement are not new, but are a codification of European Court of Justice rulings.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the implementation of the posting of workers directive following the judgments of the Court of Justice. This is an important matter, which has given rise to a series of misunderstandings and, above all, various rumours and concerns in some of our countries, and therefore we are going to follow this debate with a great deal of interest, and in particular the statement that Mr Spidla is to make on behalf of the Commission.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-417" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its June 2007 communication entitled ‘Posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services: Maximising its benefits and potential while guaranteeing the protection of workers’, the Commission highlighted some shortcomings in the implementation and cross-border enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At that time we came to the conclusion that these problems could be solved only if the Member States stepped up their mutual cooperation and, in particular, if they discharged their obligations concerning administrative cooperation and accessibility of information, as stipulated in the Directive.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Correct and effective implementation and enforcement are the key elements in the protection of the rights of posted workers, while insufficient enforcement weakens the effectiveness of the Community Directives in force in this area.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Consequently, on 3 April this year the Commission adopted a Recommendation on better cooperation in order to remedy the shortcomings in the implementation, application and enforcement of the existing Directive. The Recommendation focuses in particular on better exchange of information, improving access to information and exchange of best practices.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Better administrative cooperation should therefore lead to greater protection of working conditions in practice, lower administrative burdens for companies, more effective monitoring of the discharge of existing obligations to observe working conditions, and provision of effective controls.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Recommendation also proposes the creation of a High-Level Committee that should directly involve the social partners, who are closest to the problems on the ground, and lay the basis for closer cooperation between labour inspectorates. This Committee could be the appropriate forum to discuss a wide range of issues stemming from the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission is convinced that this Recommendation lays the basis for a more intensive fight against infringements of workers’ rights and undeclared work, and that it improves working conditions for migrant workers throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is up to the Member States now to take the necessary steps to improve the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive. The Recommendation is expected to be approved by the next Employment and Social Affairs Council on 9 June.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission then intends to evaluate the implementation of the Directive in the light of the latest European Court of Justice decisions, while cooperating closely with the European Parliament on the preparation of its own-initiative report.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission is fully committed to ensuring effective protection of workers’ rights and will continue to combat all forms of social dumping and infringements of workers’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It should be stressed that there is no conflict between consistent support for workers’ rights and support for a competitive internal market, which gives us the means to preserve Europe’s social well-being. If our society and our economy are to continue to flourish, we have to give equal priority to social aspects and to competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his presentation, and I welcome the fact that he emphasises the importance of greater cooperation between the Member States and the responsibility Member States have for implementing the Posting of Workers Directive correctly.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I think it may be justified in this debate to emphasise one thing, and that is that since 2004 we have seen rapid change in the European labour market. We have gained increased mobility. It is important to say that the various horror scenarios which were spread at the time regarding the consequences of increased mobility have proved to be false. There was talk of welfare tourism and countless other problems.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In fact today there are one million Europeans posted in different countries. Also it is the Member States where we have seen the greatest openness which have also seen the best labour market development and pay setting. The Posting of Workers Directive has helped to ensure better opportunities for individuals and has also contributed towards the European economy and a European labour market. One million people!</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must remember this when discussing the three different court cases. This is because once the court has issued its judgment, we see that it is a question of different situations in different cases. What is also important, however, is that there is nothing in this to say that there are no barriers to different kinds of industrial action in the different Member States. There is nothing in the court judgments which means that they conflict with different types of collective agreements or other pay-setting arrangements. On the other hand, the Member State must have legislation and society must function, in order to permit and encourage mobility. It is in this context that I also think it is important that we now develop better cooperation, and that the different Member States make sure that they implement and evaluate this so as to combine mobility with social security and stability for everyone in Europe. We must not blame the EU for the problems which exist. Instead we must take responsibility in the different Member States, and we must welcome the increased mobility and the wellbeing which can be seen as an opportunity provided by the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the recommendation for improved administrative cooperation and better options for the labour inspectorates. However, Commissioner, you are aware of the fact that our delight about this has been negated by the Laval and Rüffert rulings? These caused a great commotion, not only in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but also among the trade unions outside Parliament and among the countries that are currently ratifying the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have long thought that the Posting of Workers Directive was an excellent directive with a clear principle. In view of the fact that we cannot ensure that wages and working conditions are equal throughout Europe, it is not unreasonable for employees to be able to expect equal treatment in the place where they work, regardless of their nationality. It is right that the Posting of Workers Directive does not employ a comprehensive State of employment principle, but simply imposes a number of binding conditions. Yet the directive also allows the Member States the space to impose more generous provisions for the protection of workers, in accordance with their own social traditions and in keeping with collective agreements or generally binding collective agreements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The rulings took away the ground of equal treatment from under our feet. The minimum protection provided by the directive is gradually becoming a maximum. For a long time now, it has no longer been a problem of poor transposition in certain Member States. Our awareness is growing, however, that the basic philosophy of the directive is wrong and that is: workers should be protected, but in moderation. Social rights to negotiate and strike exist, but on the condition that they do not interfere with the free movement of services. This is not a question of xenophobic remarks; on the contrary. Foreign employees are more than welcome. Indeed, the free movement of workers guarantees equal treatment from day one and that is also what we want to achieve with regard to the free movement of services.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My group therefore requests a revision of the Posting of Workers Directive for three reasons: firstly, to ensure that the equal treatment of native and foreign workers is guaranteed; secondly, to guarantee that national systems for social dialogue are fully respected; and thirdly, to ensure that fundamental social rights are safeguarded for everyone. We are relying on your support, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement. There have certainly been many strong reactions to numerous judgements by the Court of Justice in recent times. Some observers feel that, on account of the Laval judgement, among others, the Treaty of Lisbon should be amended and that the Court of Justice should be restrained. I would like to say that this is overshooting the mark and is due to the fact that people on certain sides would like to put a spanner in the works and make people believe that the Treaty of Lisbon could represent a problem for the legal security of employees. On the contrary, the Treaty of Lisbon will mean more rights for employees.</p>
      <p sl="da">Other observers such as Mrs Van Lancker believe that the Posting of Workers Directive should be amended. Again, I would say no. I do not think that this should be done in the first instance. I believe, like the Commissioner who proposed it, that we should first do some thorough work to see how the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented in practice, and assess the possibilities for safeguarding against social dumping within the framework of the applicable legislation.</p>
      <p sl="da">I also think that we should await the reaction of the Member States. In this connection I am perhaps particularly thinking about the Laval case. The final judgement has not been reached in the Laval case in Sweden, and there are many aspects to this judgement – both the obvious discrimination against foreign enterprises, which we cannot support, and also the unclear information given to the enterprise. In Denmark a working committee has been set up by the government, consisting of social experts – both legal experts and social partners – to assess how the latest judgement harmonises with the Danish model, which is agreement-based and governed by legislation only to a very limited extent. I think that it would be useful to await the outcome of this committee’s work. It is a fast-working committee and will complete its work by June.</p>
      <p sl="da">As is often the case in politics, the devil is in the detail, and it is therefore important that we retain a balanced attitude towards these questions. It is only a year and a half since we had a thorough discussion in Parliament of the Posting of Workers Directive and carried out a consultation process with social partners. Everyone said that the Directive was good, but difficult to implement in practice. Employees do not know their rights and employers do not know their obligations well enough. Therefore, our conclusion is that there is a need for better information and better cooperation; this is something that you, Commissioner, are now also proposing. We have, for example, also proposed that the Dublin agency be used, which represents both governments and social partners in order to develop good practice in this area. I would very much like to hear what is happening in this area. I can well understand the fear of social dumping; however, I feel that we must deal with this issue wisely. It will take a long time if the Posting of Workers Directive is to be amended, and it is therefore important that we investigate all the possibilities in order to secure the basis for flexible labour markets such as the Danish labour market under the applicable rules. It is a question of ensuring that we can actually have flexible labour markets.</p>
      <p sl="da">The right to take industrial action will not be threatened by the judgement; however, there should be a balance regarding matters connected with conflicts. I think that it is important to emphasise that the rights of employees will be strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and that both social partners and governments must work together irrespective of boundaries in order to make the legislation work better and to operate without friction. This is the way forward!</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. The verdict in this case truly offers hope that the European Court of Justice understands the European Union’s four basic freedoms in real terms. On this occasion the term ‘social dumping’, which is so popular in this Parliament too, did not work in a case where the objective was to ban a business from another Member State from providing services in the EU internal market. In this discussion, I would like to single out one political aspect: EU Member States, and among them, largely, states such as Sweden, have in recent years made enormous profits in the Baltic states through the provision of ‘aggressive’ financial services, particularly loans for immovable property. We have never restricted the flow of this capital, even when the profits were exceptionally high and were partly obtained through the singular social dumping of exports – that is, Latvians who worked in these banks received salaries that were nowhere near the pay received by Swedes for the same work in Sweden. Now, during the financial crisis, many Latvian families will be paying through the nose for a long time for the money they have borrowed, but our people and our businesses will not be able to compete in the EU market, and so they will not be able to pay back these debts. As a result, it will in reality be the Swedish pension funds and other bank shareholders themselves that will lose out. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all in the same European boat: let us allow Europe’s basic freedoms to be truly free, as we will all gain! Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the court judgments concern cases in which the trade unions have taken internationally recognised collective measures for action against social dumping. In all three judgments the European Court of Justice recognised that the trade unions had a legitimate right to take these measures. The Court of Justice, however, challenged this right in relation to the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Laval and Rüffert cases, the legal minimum standard was interpreted as the only maximum standard valid on the internal market. The European Court of Justice therefore interpreted the Posting of Workers Directive in a very specific way. The legislator did not, however, intend it that way. In considering the Directive, the free trade in services must be promoted in fair competition and employees’ rights must be guaranteed. The Posting of Workers Directive also contains a most-favoured nation clause for employees and this was not taken into account in the court judgments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Court of Justice is now creating a situation in the European Union in which the Posting of Workers Directive has been changed from a minimum directive to a maximum directive and in which it is legitimate to assert a competitive advantage over social dumping. International social law should now be subject to charges for enterprises on the free internal market. It may be that I am thereby criticising the court judgments. However, a Union without equivalent elements of a social Europe, such as collective bargaining agreements, collective measures and combating social dumping, is doomed to failure and will no longer have the citizens’ support. Our group’s response therefore at this point is: the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same establishment’ must occupy an equivalent position in the internal market with regard to the criteria of freedom.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, first of all, I would like to note for the record that my colleagues from the Conference of Presidents, who decided on a late-night debate against my wishes, are all absent this evening. Were it not for this being a late-night debate, I would be pleased to have finally initiated a discussion of this serious matter, which is the recognition by the Court of Justice of wage dumping, a matter that you just spent 20 seconds on, Commissioner, in a remarkably offhand manner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I will briefly outline the three stages of this new dimension of European law. 11 December 2007: the Court quashed a trade union action claiming that the Finnish shipping company Viking Line should not be allowed to register its ferry in Estonia to reduce workers’ wages. 18 December 2007: the Court again found against the unions, this time in Vaxholm, Sweden, for blockading a building against a Latvian company which was refusing to observe the collective agreement applicable to the building sector. 3 April 2008: the Court found Lower Saxony in Germany guilty of imposing a minimum salary on any construction company awarded a procurement contract. The Court then found in favour of a Polish subcontractor of a German company, which was paying its workers less than half the prescribed minimum wage. This was the Rüffert ruling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In all three cases, the fundamental reason invoked by the Court to justify its decision to encourage wage dumping was that Community law prohibits any measure – take note – likely to ‘make less attractive’ the conditions of a company from another Member State because this is – and I quote – a ‘restriction on the freedom to provide services’ or the freedom of establishment, which are among the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty. This is quite simply unacceptable. Where is the social aspect of this liberal reasoning?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Effectively, any social progress in a country will make a market less attractive – to use the Court’s expression – for competing companies. I should add that, in all three cases, the famous Posting of Workers Directive has not offered the slightest protection to the workers concerned. Incidentally, the Court explained that, and I quote, the ‘directive seeks in particular to bring about the freedom to provide services’. It did not mention the protection of workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in all three cases, the Court reached its decision in the light of specific articles of the Treaty and not just the directive. These were Article 43, in the first case, and Article 49, in the two others, both being reproduced word for word in the draft Treaty of Lisbon currently in the process of ratification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My conclusion is therefore clear. Amending a directive to solve the problem posed by these rulings is not sufficient. Anyone who wants to re-establish the primacy of social rights over free trade must insist on a revision of the treaties, and specifically the articles relied on by the Court to justify its recent decisions. This is difficult, but I think that it is necessary, because otherwise we can expect a real crisis over the legitimacy of the current European economic and social model.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, recently, in the Rüffert case, a Polish company paid 53 workers only 46% of the agreed wage for the trade in Germany. The Polish contractor was prosecuted; they responded by taking the case to court, and the ECJ recently voted in favour of the Polish subcontractor.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not long ago, Mr John Monks, the President of the European Trade Union Confederation, speaking in a hearing in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs about an earlier case – the Laval case – and warning of future cases, said that ‘we have been told that our right to strike is fundamental, but not as fundamental as the free movement of services’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The trade union movement is rendered powerless by these rulings. The Services Directive and the Posting of Workers Directive represent a direct threat to everything that has been gained in workers’ rights in the last 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="de">There have been three cases – Laval, Viking and now Rüffert – and a body of judicial interpretation is building that renders contracts meaningless, unions impotent and fairness of wages an empty term. As Mr Monk stated in the hearing on Laval, we need a protective protocol in the Lisbon Treaty or face social dumping in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I believe that the Commission first published a guidance document on the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive back in 2006, and at the time the Socialist Group – in response – led a call in Parliament for a toughening up of the Directive. The Commission did not feel this was necessary then and clearly does not feel it is necessary now, and for the record I agree with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem lies, as the Commission has so clearly defined, in weaknesses in national implementation, in insufficient cooperation between Member States and in poor supply of information. Toughening up EU legislation would not address these weaknesses. In fact it would make them even more difficult to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would observe that the Commissioner confirms full commitment to protect workers’ rights and to fight against social dumping. We should all agree with that on all sides of the House, but we should also agree that there is another right to be protected: the right of all workers to be mobile, to be posted and to provide services across borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rights of social protection must go hand in hand with the right to provide services, and there need be no contradiction. It is, of course, a major challenge to get the right balance. However, the challenge is for Member States to resolve, not by the EU proposing tougher laws. I suggest that the Commissioner has pointed the way and invite him to agree with me that our role as MEPs should be to get each of our own countries to follow.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the recommendation, and I welcome even more the fact that the Commissioner seeks to combat social dumping and that Mr Barroso and Mr Špidla say that the right to strike does not subordinate free movement. However, your proposal does not go far enough. It does not go far enough to prevent social dumping.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let us first look at what the court said in the Rüffert and Laval cases. It said that it is the minimum wage in the country of origin which counts, in other words a Polish worker must work in the same workplace as a German worker for 46% of the pay the German worker works for. If you had said that women had to work for 46% of what a man earns, we would have said that this was discrimination. In this case it is discrimination against Polish workers who do not receive the same pay as German workers. This is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, different social models are not judged in the same way. In the Rüffert case it is pointed out that collective agreements must be universally applicable, and not the model which was chosen in Lower Saxony. The same thing is done in the Laval case. Certain labour market models take precedence over others. This too is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, it is said that the right to strike is fundamental, but when it is then weighed against free movement, it does not weigh very heavily, not very heavily at all. Instead it is free movement which takes precedence over it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Some speakers have said ‘yes, but we must have free movement’. Of course we must, but how do we encourage free movement if we dump the conditions in countries? Do you believe that the people living in these countries will say ‘we welcome people’? No, they will be demanding closed borders. I am in favour of open borders between new and old Member States, but I am also in favour of equal terms for equal work, and that too must be fundamental. Therefore the Commission must take stronger action regarding amendments to the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I share the opinion of my colleagues Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Wurtz for the most part. Ultimately the question is how many more poor workers do we want there to be in the European Union? That is the fundamental question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Without repeating the Court rulings, I see that we have reached a point where the Posting of Workers Directive is being used against national or regional provisions that are designed to ensure a ‘level playing field’ for all workers, to guarantee a minimum wage for all workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have therefore reached a situation in which this directive undermines the territoriality of the right to work. We can guarantee the mobility of workers, while ensuring the territoriality of the right to work, and that is what is under discussion. Leaving the Posting of Workers Directive behind for a second, I would like to draw your attention to another related subject, to the complaint that the company TNT has filed with the Commission following a judgment by an administrative tribunal in Berlin, claiming that the German government, by imposing a minimum wage in the postal sector, has failed to take into account the economic impact of the minimum wage – we are talking about a minimum wage of EUR 9.80 an hour – on its competitors. We find ourselves in a situation where the minimum wage, which is a national competence, in reality is discouraging competition. This is TNT’s interpretation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is currently examining this petition. If you or your colleagues and the College, find in TNT’s favour in this case, I believe, Mr Špidla, that you will lose all credibility, in this and in other cases, and that it will take more than a recommendation from the Commission on the best information and administrative cooperation between Member States to truly guarantee the dignity of workers in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is the task of the European Court of Justice to issue judgments in line with the Treaties. Therefore the Treaties must be amended in order to protect workers’ interests. The conclusion from the Court’s rulings in the Laval, Viking Line and Rüffert cases is that the Lisbon Treaty cannot be approved by the wage-earners of Europe unless a clause on workers’ rights is added to the Treaty – the right to defend collective agreements, the right to take industrial action to improve pay and employment conditions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Demanding pay higher than the minimum wage is now a trade barrier according to the Court, and the unions will not be able to prevent wage dumping. On 17 April this year Commissioner McCreevy answered in writing a question I asked on union rights as follows: ‘Trade unions can continue to take industrial action provided that this is motivated by legitimate aims which are compatible with EC law.’ You cannot put it more clearly than that. EC law must therefore be changed. Free movement, yes, but without discriminating against workers from other countries.</p>

This is what is known as legal activism, and it must be seen as a direct threat to democracy and the principle of subsidiarity. Owing to its arrogant attitude to the democratically elected governments of Member States, the European Court of Justice is in fact a self-appointed power in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When it comes to the Laval judgment, it means that Swedish and foreign companies will operate on completely different terms in Swedish territory. This is completely unacceptable. I urge members to think again the next time they decide to grant more power to the EU’s unelected institutions. As for today, it seems as though we are waking up at last.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Posting of Workers Directive is one of the foundations on which the practical implementation of one of the four basic Community freedoms, which are European freedoms, is based and which has accompanied treaties and the European Community right from the start.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Article 49 of the Treaty is one of the most clearly formulated regulations governing the internal affairs of the European Union, and it states unambiguously that restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Community shall be prohibited in respect of nationals of Member States who are established in a State of the Community other than that of the person for whom the services are intended. The persistent practices found in many Member States aimed at administrative restriction of this freedom, which is guaranteed in the Treaty, are therefore surprising.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Since being elected to this Parliament, I have received a flow of complaints from businesspeople originating mainly from the new Member States that acceded to the EU after 2004, against the activities of local and regional authorities that wilfully impose on these businesspeople additional requirements that are not justified in the least by any EU legal act. I have raised this issue on many occasions in this House, demanding an unambiguous statement from the European Commission on behalf of EU law, and consequently in defence of the freedom to provide services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that my efforts have received such a clear confirmation in the ruling of the European Court of Justice that we are discussing today. I am convinced that in the light of recent Court verdicts we – that is, Parliament and the European Commission together – will be able to draw up a formula for the organisation of an internal services market that, while ensuring the fundamental rights of employees, ensuring those rights – those fundamental rights – will not impose extra burdens on EU businesspeople that will hamper their activities and that are by definition – as the Court’s rulings state – in breach of European law.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. After several European Court of Justice rulings, the Posting of Workers Directive (96/71/EC) has become a focus of attention in the Union. The Court has spoken. What it actually said might be debated, but that would not be worthwhile as its decision will remain valid, and anyway the Court did not establish a scale of values.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We can see that in Parliament these rulings have given rise to mutually exclusive opinions, but it is good that the Commission has considered what has to be done and has asked the Member States. This is even more important as they are trying to pour oil on troubled waters. It is pertinent that an earlier omission by the Commission unfortunately contributed to the heightened atmosphere, as they still had not thought through the transposition of the Posting of Workers Directive into national systems, although two years before it had been emphatically requested in a European Parliament resolution. So there is no answer as to whether the Member State measures protecting workers conform to the Posting of Workers Directive and, for want of this, we are unable to state whether the Posting of Workers Directive is really working well or if it needs to be amended in the light of the laws of the service market. There are no lessons on implementation, at most there are violently clashing statements. We are moved by the question of whether this uncertain situation gives some scope to populism and demagogy. And are we not creating a political problem from accidental legal shortcomings? It may be that we have produced political tension where there should only be sober-minded regulation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the freedom of the service market operates, with very few exceptions, within the provisions of legislation. On the other hand, specific measures are required to make good the law. We hope for these specific steps from the Commission, since a comprehensive examination of the legal material cannot be undertaken by the Court. That is for the Commission to do. And it is the Commission’s job to initiate proceedings against violations of the law, where necessary. This could reinforce Mr Spindla’s words, that we have to act simultaneously and together, in the interests of the legal rights of employees and in the interests of the social market. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I disagree with you in that there would be no discrepancy between strong social protection of employees and a strong internal market. An EU internal market that complies with the system of global competition is ultimately the incarnation of this kind of opposition. I do agree with you, however, that Member States bear responsibility for the transposition of EU law into national law. At least in the Rüffert case, the rulers in Berlin and Lower Saxony do not simply point the finger at the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">They have failed in general to explain the law on collective bargaining authoritatively and to demand the legal minimum wage. Commissioner, I demand that you discharge your responsibility and openly demand the necessary requirement to amend the EU legal bases. This concerns Article 50 and Article 56, for example, of the consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty of 15 April, the sharpening of the Posting of Workers Directive, the granting of the right to take industrial action and the cross-border right to take industrial action. I also refer to the fact that the review of the political problems should not simply be left to the ECJ, but that here both the EU Institutions – the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – and the nation states bear responsibility for this through their legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon will mean a considerable improvement for employees – Mr Wurtz, I have to contradict you here. We therefore have to accept it because social policy is becoming a duty across the board. Everything in future has to be checked by legislative means from the viewpoint of social policy and the definition of the social market economy as provided for in the Treaty represents substantial progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need competitiveness, we need more productivity – and this must certainly be a headline in a global order – but in all three cases we note that it is not a matter of competition in a global order here, but rather whether work was carried out in certain sectors in the European Union between its Member States as part of a common internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must not get into a situation in which global order is used here to set employees from different Member States up against one another on the basis of international competitiveness. If employee solidarity is destroyed, the European Union, the cohesion of our societies, will also be destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason it is important that we are not now taken to task by the courts, but that we make it clear that we have to examine the legislation. The Posting of Workers Directive dates from the beginning of the 1990s. It no longer applies today. We have to find out what is wrong with it. I do not know in detail. Collective bargaining partners must check that they are concluding their collective bargaining agreements in accordance with the internal market. National legislation must be adapted to it. We have to check all this. At the same time this must not lead to partitioning and protectionism because mobility should be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we address the four basic freedoms, we mean the four basic freedoms of the market. However, my definition of a social market economy means that market can take place only within the framework permitted by the legislator so that we have a fair distribution of the benefits of this economic order and do not leave them to the free play of market forces. If this happens, the market will devour even itself. We therefore need this kind of framework condition of a social market economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, allow me in conclusion to read out a quotation. ‘Not the free market economy of the laissez-faire plundering of a past era, nor the free play of market forces’ – and similar phrases – ‘but the socially responsible market economy, in which the individual comes into his own again, which places a high value on the person and subsequently also provides a fair return for work carried out; this is the market economy of a modern type’. This is a quotation by Ludwig Erhard, of whom it definitely cannot be said that he was against a market economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me say how much I agree with Mr Brok and how much I disagree with Mr Bushill-Matthews, but I will come to that in a moment. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the recommendation adopted on 3 April. It is an important step in the right direction. I believe that the more effective exchange and access to information and the exchange of best practice will certainly help, but it was one of those strange quirks of timing that the recommendation was adopted on the same day that the Rüffert judgment was handed down. I think the Laval and Rüffert cases in particular require us to go much further than that recommendation now.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those cases raise the prospect that the economic freedoms can be interpreted as granting undertakings the right to evade or circumvent national, social and employment laws and practices. The only protection, it seems, are the provisions of the posted workers directive. If that is the case, then it is clear that we need to revisit the directive. In particular, we need to clarify the scope for collective agreements, to set mandatory standards, and for collective action to enforce those standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we need to do a number of things. We need to ensure that host country collective agreements can provide for higher than minimum standards. We need to make mandatory what are currently only options for Member States, such as applying all generally binding collective agreements to posted workers. I think we also need a clear time limit for the definition of a posted worker, so that there is a clear idea of when a posted worker ceases to be a posted worker.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, for now, I think we need to broaden the legal base of the directive to include freedom of movement of workers, as well as the freedom to provide services. That was a proposal which was rejected back in 1996, but I hope we can see now how important it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the Court that has said that the right to strike and the right of association are fundamental rights, but not as fundamental as the economic freedoms. Trade unions might be forgiven for thinking that they are suddenly living on Animal Farm. We owe it to them to restore a proper balance. I think these modest proposed changes to the posting of workers directive would be a start.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, when we considered the Treaty of Lisbon in February, both my fellow Members and I proposed that the right to take collective industrial action should belong within the competence of the Member States. Unfortunately, the majority of you voted against this and now the following question must be raised: why did you do it? The only logical explanation and the logical consequence is that the cross-border pursuit of the biggest profits possible by employers will ultimately take precedence over the right of employees to defend themselves against social dumping. You might of course believe this, but you must then stop talking about a social Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">Employees in every country must have the unconditional right to take industrial action in order to ensure that migrant workers receive at least the same salaries as themselves. This is not discrimination. We do not believe that migrant workers should have lower salaries than workers who already live in the country. We are against discrimination and action must therefore be taken. The alternative is social dumping. This is a downward spiral. Therefore, using whatever means necessary, we must at least secure the free and unrestricted right to take industrial action through a legally binding protocol in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, it is true that we are extremely disappointed to see how the freedom of provision of services is being applied in case law. One might be forgiven for thinking that, in some interpretations, the ECJ has sought to establish the pre-eminence of articles 43 and 49 over every other consideration. However, I am wary of Manichean analyses of these case-law decisions, which, as you all know, are first and foremost test cases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the question we need to ask ourselves is how to guarantee the social acquis. More specifically, we need to answer two questions. Firstly, what wage level must companies be subjected to under the national laws of the host country? Secondly, to what extent can we restrict the collective action of trade unions intended to ensure equal treatment of national and posted workers?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In answer to these questions, I do not believe in a change in the Posting of Workers Directive. I even think that we would be taking a huge risk in attempting this. Conversely, I find the European Trade Union Confederation’s proposal for a social clause more interesting. I think that this is quite simply, as Mr Brok said, a case of applying the treaties, both old and new: Article 3.3, Article 6.1 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now substantive law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also need to enforce – and the national parliaments could supervise this – the principle of subsidiarity in all that concerns the right to work, workers’ rights and the right to strike in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the more immediate future, the French Presidency is about to launch the Social Agenda. For you, Commissioner, the Commission must go further than the point that you made and the minimum administrative recommendation for a more political text, taking full account of the uncertainties arising from case law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, closer cooperation between national administrations is, of course, right and proper. I welcome this. It is even essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, if we all genuinely want to avert a race for the lowest minimum wage in Europe, we need more, and you know that, too, Commissioner. According to the Rüffert judgment, there is only one solution in my opinion. We have to improve the Posting of Workers Directive. The Commission is also required to do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to draw legislative consequences from this judgment because it reverses the intention of the Posting of Workers Directive. The freedom to provide services is placed higher than the protection of employees here. Even the planned change from minimum to maximum protection is explained. In my country, Germany, 8 out of 16 federal states are directly affected by this judgment. The regional governments just wanted to serve as models here on wage dumping matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">Based on the Posting of Workers Directive as well as on the procurement directives, they wanted to ensure compliance with certain social criteria, at least when awarding public contracts. They have therefore demanded compliance with local standard wage rates as a social criterion, since these are above the minimum wage.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is difficult for me to understand the decision of the Court of Justice. If we really want social criteria – and I think we all want this – then it must be possible to achieve even more than a minimum wage. The judgment should not entrap us into continuing to authorise minimum standards alone in future for posted workers. This is not the social Europe that my group wants. To be on the safe side, we also need to examine the procurement directives carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">Back in Germany, the judgments of the European Court of Justice on employment addressed this evening have created a back flash in Europe’s acceptance. We are all now being asked to change tack again here.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, if we were dealing with a minor problem I would understand that a simple recommendation dealing with exchanging good practice and incorporating more efficient information could resolve the problem. However, Commissioner, the problem is that we are dealing with a major problem, which I regret very much was not even mentioned in your speech.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem, Commissioner, is that currently we have consistent case law from the Court of Justice that states that workers from one country may work in another country for less than 50% of the salary, under a directive which, it has to be said, was created precisely to prevent this.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, if it is possible to have legislation in force that allows this situation, we clearly have a fundamental problem that cannot be solved purely by solving information problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Commissioner, we have a problem in that the various national union practices on setting salaries and collective agreements are left out. Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany have been left out. This is therefore a massive problem, not for those countries, but for the whole of Europe, which is seeing how its national laws are being undermined, and how Europe is not only failing to guarantee better protection for its workers but is breaking the systems of national protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">In view of this situation, Commissioner, I do not think that we can look the other way. I do not think that we can prescribe aspirin when what is needed is major surgery, and I think that we need to restore a balance between the principles of workers’ rights and the rights of the market, because otherwise not only social Europe but the whole of Europe will go this way.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of the Posting of Workers Directive is to ensure the freedom to provide services while at the same time guaranteeing employee’s rights. In my view this Directive has benefited of the European Union, and the criticism I am hearing today here in this House is to a large extent unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would point out that in the Rüffert case, which we are discussing, violation of social standards and the setting of wages at the scandalously low level of 46% took place not as a result of any defects in the Posting of Workers Directive, but simply as a result of the failure to implement part of the relevant legislation of Lower Saxony in the manner envisaged in the Posting of Workers Directive. We are consequently dealing here with a problem implementing legislation within Germany, not with defects in the Posting of Workers Directive. We have a similar situation in the Laval case, where there is in turn a situation in Sweden where minimum pay is not prescribed either by statute or in a collective agreement in the manner envisaged in the Posting of Workers Directive. It is my view, therefore, that the way out of this situation is primarily through the adaptation of national legislation to the provisions of the current Directive, although I concede that there are many matters that could still be improved in the Directive, and in these matters I support the Commission’s opinion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to take this opportunity to speak about the concept of social dumping, which has been very frequently mentioned here. I note that the concept of social dumping does not exist either in international law or in economic theory. It is purely a propaganda term. One cannot speak of dumping in a situation where posted workers – Poles in Germany or Latvians in Sweden – receive a remuneration that is higher than what they would get in their own country. Nor can one speak of social dumping in a situation where there are no binding social or wage standards for all countries, and the reason there are no such standards is that the level of development of our Member States is different, and in addition, policy differs from state to state.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think that it is clear that the judgment of the Court of Justice threatens the very foundations of the European Union. It is clear that the Court of Justice is the highest body for interpreting European Union law, and there is no one right now who wants to weaken that institution. This case law, however, as Mr Cercas pointed out, threatens the principle of social cohesion. For many people in Europe, a European Union that does not guarantee minimum social rights does not deserve to exist and therefore we are threatening the very existence of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">As we cannot go against the judgments of the Court and we have to comply with them, the time has clearly come for the institutions with legislative power – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – to adopt measures to ensure that this case law does not become permanent, because it is case law attached to specific legal texts that can be changed.</p>
      <p sl="es">It appears that the Court itself is inviting us to make this legislative change, and I think that it is now the responsibility of the Commission, first of all, but also of Parliament and the Council, to change the legislative texts in order to prevent this case law from becoming permanent.</p>

Work health and safety standards, the maximum number of working hours and the minimum period of leave or maternity benefits are not implemented when it comes to posted workers.</p>

Such à la carte justice should not motivate us, and we should not accept it.</p>

      <p sl="en">A previous speaker, Mr Andersson, made the very valid point that, if a woman was paid 46% of what a man was paid for doing the same work in the same country, it would be considered as discrimination. Yet this seems to be sanctioned by the courts when it comes to workers from different countries doing the same work in the same country. Again, I would like the Commissioner’s comments as to how the transposition and implementation of the Directive impacted on this situation.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Court of Justice’s three judgements on Viking Lines, Laval and Rüffert are based a single premise. That premise stems from the four freedoms of movement of capital enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht, the Directives on the internal market and on the posting of workers, as confirmed by Articles 43 and 49 in the renamed European Constitution, which is the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="el">The judgements of the European Court of Justice are political and deeply reactionary: big business groups impose mediaeval terms of employment to increase their profits.</p>
      <p sl="el">Not only are the rights to strike and to collective bargaining being called into question, but there is a third important factor that I should like to add. International labour conventions, which have been signed and ratified through the International Labour Organisation (ILO), are being called into question. For this reason, equal pay and equal work for all workers must be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Workers from the countries joining the EU after 1 May 2004 owe nothing to anyone. Together with all the other workers of Europe, they should fight to improve working conditions and pay. There should be equal pay for equal work.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the posting of workers is indissolubly linked to the freedom to provide services. By its decision, the Court of Justice supported this, in my view, supremely important principle of the common market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would, however, like to express my disenchantment with the fact that regulations still exist in the Community market that are out of line with the Posting of Workers Directive. Let us not forget that the Directive is aimed at helping both workers and contractors. Situations in which key provisions of the Directive are interpreted differently in the different Member States are also inadmissible. Workers are not aware of their rights, and Member States do not monitor whether the provisions of the Directive are being correctly applied. Proper implementation and execution of these provisions is, after all, key to the efficient functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why all measures, whether in the form of administrative cooperation or of pointers to the proper application of the Directive, are essential actions.

I too am a big fan of equal treatment as a principle and can honestly say that sometimes I find it very difficult to understand why, for the work I do in this House, I receive a much lower salary than my western colleagues (ten times less than the Italians). However, I understand that it will take some time for salaries in Europe to equalise.</p>
      <p sl="et">Today I am left with the impression of great hypocrisy here. Many people take the floor and speak on behalf of the one million posted workers, fighting for their rights. But let’s be honest – most speakers are not in fact representing those one million posted workers here, but are instead protecting their own labour market. Because of this I am very pleased that the Commissioner has promised to establish a committee to examine this matter. A very unfair impression has been left here by these three cases. It was, however, necessary in order to report on areas where there is exploitation, where there is social dumping, where there is insecurity. Fortunately, in these three cases there was none.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all your contributions. It has been very interesting hearing them. I think that we have had a rich and lively debate here today. I have also taken note of the various opinions expressed. These differences of interpretation and points of view have led me to treat this subject with caution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The debate has also revealed the enormous complexity of the subject and the difficult legal issues that arise here. The three Court of Justice rulings are all specific. It would be wrong to draw general conclusions from them. First of all, it is up to the Member States concerned to assess what they need to do in a national context to comply with the Court rulings. I would also like to endorse the constructive approach taken in Sweden and Denmark to bring about this compliance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, today has shown that it is important to have an in-depth discussion so that we can give the appropriate response to the problems raised. This is precisely one of the priorities of the Commission at this time. We have effectively decided to continue this discussion as we prepare for a new Social Agenda. This Agenda, which I will unveil next June before the College, will of course include the results of a wide-ranging consultation launched on the new social realities. It also follows on from the Commission Communication on ‘Opportunities, access and solidarity: towards a new social vision for 21st century Europe’. This is a real opportunity to promote new solutions to respond to the challenges faced by our European societies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Among these challenges are, of course, demographic change and the increasing pace of technological progress, but also the social impact of globalisation. The diverse forms of mobility among workers and the rise in migration, which is probably inevitable, pose new challenges to which we must respond. These are questions that we must address in order to preserve and strengthen our European social model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that the Social Agenda is the right vehicle to propose an initial response designed and tailored for the challenges of mobility to ensure protection for workers. The debate that the European Parliament is about to have in the context of its own initiative report will also be a step in the right direction. The Commission is also committed to playing an active role in this and to facilitating discussions and the search for solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to work with an open mind, setting high standards that are in tune with social and economic realities. I want us to progress constructively and confidently. The complexity of social realities makes it harder to formulate ‘turnkey’ solutions. We need to spend more time discussing the Social Agenda. By doing this, a more protective and global approach will emerge for the Community’s workers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0080/2008) by Ana Maria Gomes, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on China’s policy and its effects on Africa (2007/2255(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-454" speaker_id="28306" name="Ana Maria Gomes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, China’s unrestrained quest for oil, natural resources and new markets in Africa raises concerns about the impact of China’s growing presence in that continent and the respective ramifications for European policies. Europe cannot start pointing the finger at China out of fear, nor can it afford to take part in an unprincipled competition avoiding methods and criteria that are in Beijing’s own interest. Both Europe and China have an obligation to contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals: poverty reduction and conflict resolution in Africa. Both have to recognise that only through promoting sustainable development and good governance can their own interests and investments be sustainable and seen as legitimate in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this report we have tried to analyse China’s presence in Africa in an objective way, acknowledging both the positive and negative impacts. Based on various specific recommendations for action, there are two key political messages: firstly, the EU needs to give a coordinated response to the challenges raised by China’s supposedly ‘no strings’ policy. This response cannot abandon European principles. The EU must stick to its development cooperation policy, especially as regards human rights conditionality. This is because there can be no good governance without respect for human rights and without good governance, and the rule of law it implies, there will be no sustainable development in Africa or any other part of the world. Secondly, Europe must involve China in discussions on their respective African policies, but such cooperation obviously cannot occur over the heads of the Africans. This trilateral involvement requires adequate support for the role to be played by the African institutions, such as the African Union, NEPAD, other regional institutions and governments and national parliaments. For this reason, Europe must increase its support for strengthening African civil society to encourage accountability from the respective governments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this report, we recommend that the EU should not pass up opportunities to talk candidly with China, or about China in Africa, specifically when this means voicing criticism in private or in public. China wants to be seen as a responsible player in Africa, yet it frequently invokes the rhetoric of non-interference to try to justify unacceptable actions, such as its continued complacency towards the Sudanese Government blocking the sending of a UN-African Union hybrid force – which should have been in Darfur long ago – or its more recent and disgusting sending of arms to the Mugabe regime on board a vessel that is – quite rightly – being prevented from unloading by Zimbabwe’s neighbouring countries. In reality, everything China does in Africa has a political impact, be it positive or negative.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, China is showing it is a pragmatic power that learns fast. It is therefore vital that Europe does not stop trying to get across to Beijing that what is expected of a permanent member of the UN Security Council, such as China, is in fact a contribution towards promoting UN principles and objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this report, we propose that the EU should encourage China to step up its participation in multilateral donor meetings and adopt specific internationally accepted criteria and guidelines on transparency of aid, the extractive industries, good governance, environmental protection, labour rights, etc., with a view to ensuring that it really contributes to poverty reduction, the Millennium Development Goals and promoting peace and security in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet Europe also needs to take a look in the mirror and learn from its own mistakes and shortcomings as regards Africa. Member States need to deliver on official development assistance pledges and cutting aid and the goals to be achieved will only help emphasise China’s merits in making quick funding available to Africa. Europe needs to improve the effectiveness of its aid and ensure there is consistency between its various policies and this implies no longer turning a blind eye to the crimes committed by certain oppressive African regimes with whom it continues to deal, as usual, at flagrant odds with its proclaimed criteria and principles.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To conclude, Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues for their excellent cooperation. Their amendments have contributed a great deal to enriching this report. I hope that such a broad consensus can continue tomorrow, all the more so as there are only a few amendments to vote on. I have put forward three amendments myself: two involve minor corrections and the third is to restate the European Parliament’s position, calling for the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to become legally binding. This would avoid the current paragraph 62 repeating the call contained in paragraph 66.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, honourable members, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Gomez for her excellent work on this sensitive and difficult, even controversial, subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I support the numerous recommendations that you made concerning the policy that the European Union must adopt to tackle China’s growing presence in Africa. The EU and China actually have a number of things in common in their dealings with Africa. Firstly, they have both recognised Africa’s enormous potential perhaps more – or in any case sooner – than anyone else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU and China are also two of the most important trading partners investing in Africa, ranked first and third in the world respectively. Naturally this calls for far greater cooperation, discussion and perhaps joint strategies between China and Europe with regard to Africa and in consultation with Africa. I share your opinion on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to talk to you today about the points that I consider promising, in order to engage China and our African partners in trilateral cooperation. I would also like to share with you my doubts and questions over other points. Finally, I would like to tell you how I intend to follow up this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, Africa is living in the age of the global economy and globalisation. It is confirming its status as an international and global player, taking action on major global issues. It has constructed a vast network of partnerships around the world with a clear commitment to re-establishing relations. To be honest, it is now forcing its partners to compete with each other, rather clumsily perhaps, but with good reason. This is a reality, and I would even go so far as to say that it is fair and legitimate. It means that its partners must be modern, trusting and fair in their attitude.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the EU and China are ready to implement this new approach and that they want to do so, perhaps for different reasons, but clearly they are ready for this. We are both major partners of Africa. Our African policy is of course different in terms of principles and values but, on the ground, it is possible to identify numerous joint interests and similarities. For example, we have already commenced a dialogue on peace, stability and sustainable development in Africa. Clearly though we need to go further with the crucial support of our African friends, who must provide the impetus for this dialogue. This explains the trilateral approach which I proposed last year and which you seem to share, particularly in your proposal for the building of a permanent platform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this respect, you quite rightly underline the importance of equality and mutual respect, which must underpin this trilateral partnership. At the risk of sparking controversy, Europe must understand that it is not necessarily wise at the current time, and with a partner such as China, to try to take control by unilaterally dictating our terms. We must avoid generalisations and embark on the dialogue process. It is my belief that once we have embarked on a dialogue with China, we will be able to use this to address issues such as rule of law, democracy and governance; in other words, everything on which Europe’s values and the inspiration for its policies are built.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with you that we need a European policy which is more effective and perhaps more expeditious, since this is the main advantage that the Chinese have over us. It would be more attractive too, more in step with the priorities of our African partners. To give you just one example, we are literally powerless, as European institutions, to deploy programmes, aid or measures in any post-conflict situations. Take the case of Liberia for example. This is a country where we have an elected government, a President who has a real programme and who wants change. Where is the effective response that this country needs to see that peace, stabilisation and democracy pay dividends? Nowhere! This pains me on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The modernisation of Europe’s policy towards Africa has been my priority since I took office. I think it is safe to say that we have already made considerable progress, particularly with the strategic partnerships resulting from the Lisbon Summit, although clearly there still remains a long way to go. The fight against poverty continues to the main objective of our development policy. To do this, we must create wealth and economic growth. China is witnessing this economic growth on a daily basis, and obviously this experience could benefit the African countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, economic growth of any kind must be accompanied by an active redistribution policy if it is to be effective in tackling poverty. I have said it many times: growth does not guarantee development. Redistribution is the key, and redistribution needs a solid government. It also needs a vigilant society, a free press, all of these things. I believe that the EU and China have a real role to play here, although this a lengthy process that will require considerable effort from both sides.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to tell you about some of the questions I have. Is it truly realistic for example, is it constructive, is it useful, is it even desirable to begin this cooperation by insisting that China adopt the policies and standards laid down by the CAP? I somehow doubt it. If it works then so much the better, but I doubt it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, Africans do not seem overly keen to see China go down this path, precisely because they are looking for alternatives to European development assistance. Chinese aid is valued precisely because it is faster than European aid and it does not impose as many constraints which will ultimately reduce Africa’s political space. There is some basis for this. There has been a misunderstanding somewhere. People often say ‘you Europeans, you impose conditions!’ This is not true. There are no political conditions attached to the cooperation or the funding that we provide. The nature of that aid, the way in which it is used, yes. Budgetary support, for example, will not be offered if there is not good governance, there will be no budgetary support for countries where conflict exists. However, that does not stop us from offering development assistance or humanitarian aid, even when we do not agree with the government or the regime in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is fundamentally different, where there is confusion, is that the Chinese are responsive, their disbursement process is much faster than ours, with all our bureaucracy, which has been the bane of my life for nearly four years. This is the reality, this is where the confusion and misunderstanding lie and I think that this point needs to be made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Evidently I share your assessment. It is important for Chinese aid to be aligned with African’s national priorities, national systems, preferably in conjunction with other partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same can be said today. It is premature, maybe even counterproductive, to force things in this sense, not to mention attempting it unilaterally. This is a long-term goal, but for now I can only see three areas where our cooperation and dialogue can be concentrated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One is the creation of an open and constructive dialogue on Africa between the EU, a longstanding donor, and China. The second is the need to trade our development experiences with China and Africa so that together we can progress the development agenda. For example, China has designed a series of photovoltaic programmes. Clearly, on a continent such as Africa, there is room for trilateral cooperation, and this is one example. I spoke to the Minister for Trade about this after I met him at a meeting in Tonga, and he was very open on the subject. We will discuss it again in Beijing, as I am going straight there after this, so we will revisit these issues there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we need to honour our commitments in terms of the Paris Agenda. This is a question of regulatory harmonisation and of the division of labour. On this I ask, I urge Parliament to help us, to force our Member States to put their money where their mouth is. Every single development minister, every single prime minister in Europe, without exception, agrees that there needs to be a better division of labour, more coordination to ensure cohesion. This is fair enough, but when we suggest real labour-sharing strategies to them, we get no response. This point needs to be raised because it is a fact. You see, my objective is not just to bring China into the CAP. I want to go further than that by trying to find common ground with the various Chinese operators in Africa, including the government, in order to foster development in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We Europeans and the Chinese must start with the African agenda and make contributions and pool our respective advantages, without sacrificing the values and principles that have guaranteed the stability, peace and prosperity of Europe over the last 50 years. That does not make me a dreamer or a fool, indeed quite the opposite. It is important to recognise, as you do, that China’s commitment raises questions and sometimes concerns, even in Africa. I too worry sometimes about what form cooperation with China will take, but so what? This is exactly why I am saying that we need dialogue. It is evident that China is pursuing its economic, diplomatic and strategic interests in Africa. Europe has all too often made the mistake of not admitting that it is tempted by the same thing and, rather than hide behind arguments, which are at times extremely hypocritical in any case, it would be far better to admit that Africa has potential, that it has special links with Europe and that we have a shared interest in discovering, building and forging those links. I believe that this is the win-win strategy, because it is only in this way that we will solve the negative equation of donor and beneficiary, which always gives rise to humiliation and suspicion and a feeling of dependency of one on the other - of the weakest on the strongest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I have said, the day after tomorrow, I will be in Beijing and I will try, Mrs Gomez, to test the water with a positive interpretation of your excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for Mrs Gomes’s excellent report, I would like to emphasise the following points from that opinion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Chinese authorities must respect the principles of democracy, good governance and human rights in their relations with Africa. The Committee on Foreign Affairs therefore deplores China’s purely pragmatic cooperation with the repressive regimes in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The commercial presence of the People’s Republic on African territory brings ecological effects that China must deal with in a responsible manner. After all, the Western press is issuing frankly alarming reports of exploitation of the natural environment, particularly in the Congo Delta region. These reports range from oil exploitation and overfishing, to deforestation in an official nature reserve of all places.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Committee on Foreign Affairs equally deplores the fact that Beijing excludes a number of African states from the strategic partnership between China and Africa, purely because of their diplomatic contacts with Taiwan. This attitude of the Chinese is not only contrary to its own principle of non-involvement in the internal affairs of third countries, but is also not in keeping with the current rapprochement between Taiwan en Beijing.</p>

    <intervention id="2-457" speaker_id="28112" name="Gay Mitchell" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, China began to trade and change in the 1980s, and it has lifted 400 million of its own people out of poverty, as Ms Gomes’s excellent report mentions. What other part of the world in that period of time has lifted 400 million people out of poverty? We have to be realistic about this. This is one of the issues we need to discuss here tonight.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many other parts of the world have experienced the heat of the Chinese dragon. The economic upturns in many Latin American and African countries are largely down to the economic rise of China. China’s activities, whether in investment, trade or aid in Africa, have grown at a mesmerising rate over the last number of years. The figures speak for themselves. The value of Chinese trade with Africa increased from USD 2 billion in 1999 to almost USD 40 billion in 2005. As the Commissioner has said, China is now Africa’s third most important trading partner.</p>
      <p sl="de">China’s engagement with Africa is opening up many opportunities. However, it is necessary that we pass a critical eye over its development impacts. The development potential and the conditions for development are two sides of the same coin. Without one it is not possible to achieve the other. It is true that the potential for development abounds in many Africa countries, but corrupt African governments have for decades shown a disregard for their populations, denying them the possibility to develop. It is the African political authorities that will decide whether China’s involvement is to be seen as a benefit or a curse for the ordinary African person.</p>
      <p sl="de">Congo is a prime example of where great a development potential lies. The output per head there is USD 714 a year. The Congolese people have suffered greatly. China has entered into a deal with Congo to build eight hospitals, thousands of kilometres of roads and rail stations, and in return they will get much-needed minerals for China. But if this can be made to work, it cannot just be a win-win situation. It can be a win-win-win situation, because it can advance the cause of the Millennium Development Goals. Can we in Europe work with China to try to perfect what is happening, to try to improve the situation rather than simply to decry what China does or the shortcomings that China has? If we can work together with China and Africa to improve good governance, then I think we can deliver aid and trade and improvement.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the Commissioner was right: if we want to get China to listen to us, then megaphone diplomacy will not work. A big part of the Chinese make-up is that they cannot lose face. Diplomacy – quiet diplomacy – has a better chance of achieving what we want to achieve. I think that Europe should work with China to encourage best practice in what could be the first real opportunity to do something for Africa after years of talking about it and doing nothing. If China put us under pressure to compete to deliver the Millennium Development Goals, all the better. We need that competition; we need that pressure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Ms Gomes on this serious, politically very important report.</p>
      <p sl="en">China is a global player in the contemporary world, and we would like to see China as a real partner of the European Union in the process of globalisation. China should play an important role in the new world order and we praise the peaceful role played by China in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, China must take her responsibilities in the area of human rights and development. In particular, China should use its influence to curb the nastiest of its friends, including the Government of Sudan. Fortunately, China has ceased to resist the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur and is sending some of its own military engineers to join the force.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the negative side, China has still sent arms to dictatorial regimes in Africa. Just this week, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania blocked attempts by a Chinese vessel to deliver a massive shipment of ammunition, mortars and other lethal armaments to President Mugabe in Zimbabwe. These weapons could play an anti-democratic, even deadly role, in the hands of the Mugabe regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this report, the European Parliament calls on China to be on the side of African societies, democracy and human rights in Africa.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I should like to thank Ms Gomes for the huge amount of work she has done on this report and her close cooperation with colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report is very wide-ranging, so I must focus on just a few issues. In particular, I welcome the call for the Commission to come forward as soon as possible with proposals to outlaw all illegally sourced timber and timber products from the EU market. This is essential to stop trade by the back door of Chinese furniture made from illegally logged African timber. Such trade not only puts African tropical forests at risk but also deprives African countries of much-needed tax revenue. The World Bank estimates that illegal logging costs developing countries USD 15 billion a year in lost revenue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I fully support the rapporteur in calling for the EU to adopt a legally binding instrument on controlling arms exports and to maintain its arms embargo on China. Since the report was written, we have had graphic evidence, as a number of colleagues have mentioned, that China is still exporting arms to countries like Zimbabwe, which are perpetrating gross violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">On wider trade issues, I personally support the mention of economic partnership agreements (EPAs) in the report. EPAs are not irrelevant, because if they were more flexible and more clearly development friendly, they could serve as a model for China-Africa trade. As it stands, China risks pushing Africa back into the commodity trap.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I applaud the report’s appeal for multilateral dialogue between the EU, Africa and China. This is particularly important in relation to climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner mentioned the example of photovoltaics. No continent is more vulnerable to global warming than Africa, and the future of millions of Africans may depend on the EU bringing China into the post-Kyoto agreement and sharing renewables technology.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the report by Mrs Gomes presents all the most important aspects of the Chinese presence in Africa. There is only one inaccuracy – the Chinese presence in Africa has nothing to do with any development policy, let alone aid. Development policy here is no more than a tool for the implementation of China’s two general strategic aims.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first aim is to ensure supplies of raw materials using fairly brutal raw materials diplomacy. It is the rising Chinese demand for natural and power-generating raw materials that is turning Sudan, Angola and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa into countries of such significance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second, and no less important, aim of the Chinese Government is to consolidate the world’s authoritarian pole as a counterbalance to the liberal-democratic models of the West. Hence the violation of even a UN embargo on trade in arms with Darfur, Liberia and Congo. Hence the political bonds between Beijing and Sudan, Chad, Zimbabwe and Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The exclusion from aid cooperation of countries that recognise Taiwan is a further symptom of the primacy of a particularist strategy over development policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today we have to concede that Europe is powerless in this situation. Of course we can follow up the Commissioner’s appeals and bin the OECD’s principles as regards corruption and public finances, and then we can do the same with other international understandings. Finally, we can even bin the United Nations Charter, but in that case we shall cease to know what our role in world politics is based on, and in what way we differ from other players in world politics.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for the excellent and balanced report and for an excellent cooperation. In the EU, we are used to having a leading role in Africa in terms of trade and development. However, with growing investment from China things could change quickly. The EU’s presence in Africa is not without its problems; however, China’s presence is threatening to develop in a highly unfortunate direction. China’s enormous demand for raw materials and energy is governing Chinese investments without any particular concern for the healthy development of society. China should instead focus on concerns such as job creation through appropriate investments, i.e. it should stop bringing in its own workforce and instead develop the production sector and processing in situ, i.e. in Africa. However, good governance must also be incorporated into the investment policy. Hitherto, China has refused to adopt this approach and has not shown any concern for whether it is supporting corrupt and violent regimes or whether it is contributing to the suppression of the civilian population. China must follow the democratic rules of the game and respect human rights, instead of merely offering itself as a cheap alternative.</p>
      <p sl="da">After all, the Chinese could do so much for the Africans. Allow me to highlight one of Africa’s most significant problems, which has already been mentioned, namely population growth. China has unique knowledge and experience in this field, which could be of great help. In addition, ladies and gentlemen, imagine if China is now buying arms, as several people have mentioned today, arms which have been sent to Zimbabwe and which are now being refused entry at many ports in countries such as Mozambique and South Africa. China would then show itself as a superpower that listens to others and lives up to the responsibility that results from a seat on the UN Security Council. This is certainly what the report is encouraging: that a good dialogue be established between the EU, China and Africa to the benefit of all parties.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, let’s hear it for Mrs Gomes, but I would also like to ask a general question. I would like to ask who the Chinese government are trying to kid. Well, I have an idea: I think that it is trying to kid everyone. It has made a laughing stock of the European Commission, which I must say was extremely naive and lenient in the textile quotas episode. It is making a mockery of the rules of international trade – if there still are any – by constantly failing to check whether its exports are manufactured in accordance with the quality and safety standards of importing countries, particularly when it comes to toys, thus proving the absurdity of free trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is making a laughing stock of France by organising anti-French demonstrations in Paris because it was upset by French protests about the mistreatment of the people of Tibet, which it continues to oppress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is making a laughing stock of the whole world, because it knows that the world is market-led and that it covets the Chinese market. Therefore, it does exactly what it wants. Its domination will be all the more complete since, through political cunning, the Chinese government has managed to outmanoeuvre Europe, Mr Michel, to get to Africa, thus gaining control of our staple commodities. Who can blame it? It is only profiting from our weakness, not least of all the stupid and dangerous disengagement of Europe, and France in particular, from a continent which will become increasingly important to us in the 21st century.</p>

    <intervention id="2-464" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is becoming clear in the example of Africa that the much vaunted development cooperation does not usually go quite so much to plan as one would like to imagine. All too often it is used to promote exports from donor countries and sometimes to support dictators or even merely to create new dependencies using debt management policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context the latest ambitions of China and India on the African continent should be treated from a European viewpoint with the utmost scepticism. Here low-cost countries, which are damaging the European economy on a massive scale, are apparently trying to secure sources of cheap raw materials and open up new outlets. This kind of persistent neo-colonialism – as I would like to call it – of Africa by China and India would at one blow negate all the efforts of Western policy to date. Beijing or New Delhi cannot be allowed to incite nations that have recently had their debts written off to borrow and create new dependencies merely to secure supplies of raw materials. By the same token, African nations should not be allowed to hold up their hands all too eagerly to receive development aid when they are not even prepared to take back their own citizens when they are seized as illegal immigrants by Frontex off the coasts of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the basis of the global balance of power, we as Europeans shall be made to look exceedingly ridiculous, however, if we try to exert pressure on China. Nor does China shy away from doing business with governments that are pilloried internationally, such as Sudan, for instance. Nor does it shy away either from supplying weapons to Zimbabwe. For a country in which human rights and democracy, environmental protection and sustainability currently continue to have such little importance, this approach is probably not totally illogical either.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards Africa, we therefore need a policy that demands stability, democracy and human rights, as well as – and this is the most important point – one that has European interests in mind. The European Union must not hand out money indefinitely in Africa without linking it to objectives in terms of content and policy. The approach so far has bestowed a vacuum on us, which has resulted in waves of migration, human rights violations and great poverty. The ambitions of China and India will probably push this even further if we do not ultimately make a U-turn. We Europeans cannot continue to finance humanitarian projects alone and allow other powers, such as China and India in this case, to continue their major trading operations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when I think of Africa, I very often ask myself: is Africa a somewhat forgotten continent from our European perspective or do we as Europeans see opportunities in Africa?</p>
      <p sl="de">I often have the impression that we Europeans still see Africa much too much as a problem case and that we do not recognise the opportunities. The Chinese approach to Africa is very different. To the Chinese, Africa is first and foremost an opportunity and they are concentrating on utilising this opportunity. They have been doing this relatively unnoticed in recent years. Only in recent months have they been noticed much, and for this reason, they are pursuing a policy of purely economic interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Issues such as human rights, the rule of law and good governance, which some of our fellow Members have already addressed today, do not hold any sway at the moment for the Chinese in Africa. Their only concern is investments in infrastructure in Africa so that they can gain unlimited access to the raw materials markets. It is about covering China’s growing need for raw materials. It is definitely not about helping the African nations and the African people on their way to truly sustainable economic development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am of the firm conviction that we must place greater emphasis on anchoring the African nations in the world economy so that they are able to benefit from globalisation on the world markets with their raw materials, with their resources, with everything they have to offer, and not become unilaterally dependent on Chinese monopolies. We must enter into a dialogue with the African nations here better than we have so far. We must also assimilate competition with the Chinese here more intensively than in the past and really do all that we can to persuade Africans about good governance and the advantage of free markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only then will we succeed in promoting the rule of law, democracy and human rights in Africa and thereafter succeed in not allowing the African nations to drift off in China’s direction, because Africa will certainly learn nothing from China – we have learnt this the hard way in recent weeks – about how democracy and the social market economy operate.</p>

The growing Chinese presence in Africa forces us to adopt a European course of action to cope with the opportunities and new challenges that present themselves as best we can.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Chinese contribution to Africa as an aid donor is a good thing, but I would like to take a few moments to highlight two aspects: for us Europeans – partly on the basis of the principles and commitments enshrined in the Cotonou agreement and more generally in line with the overall framework of our development policy – it is worrying that China, along with aid, is unfortunately exporting a number of dreadful domestic practices including corruption, bad lending, lack of respect for workers’ rights, and a low level of consideration for environmental matters.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another issue that needs to be carefully monitored is the close relationship between Beijing and certain totalitarian and repressive regimes in Africa, such as Sudan and Zimbabwe. In this context, China needs to shoulder all the responsibilities that come with its role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, China’s policy in Africa poses a threat to the harmonious development of the African countries. Working conditions in Chinese companies operating in Africa are equal to those of slavery. China continues to offer African dictators political and financial aid and is escalating military cooperation with African regimes. Sudan and Zimbabwe are the main importers of arms from China. China offers African countries huge loans without any transparency conditions, encouraging the already wide-spread corruption within the groups in power in African countries. The illegal export of African wood and ivory by China is having a disastrous effect on Africa’s environment. In a situation like this, development cooperation policy fails to achieve its objectives. Therefore, I would like to urge the EU to ensure that China does not fail to ignore respect for human rights and good administration when implementing investments and that any trade in arms with African countries where a war or military conflict is taking place or is imminent should be stopped. Until China is prepared to stop trading in arms, the EU should impose an arms embargo on the country. There is one more thing that needs to be pointed out, and this is mainly that in view of China’s policy in Africa the individual EU Member States should overcome their disagreements. Newly reexamined EU policy would enable Africa to use its natural and human resources in a mutually beneficial way and continue with the development of its economical and political independence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the report by Mrs Gomes is in effect a detailed lecture on the subject of the highly complex trilateral links between African states and China, with particular reference to EU interests. On top of this we also have the role played in Africa’s development by other organisations, such as the World Bank.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no doubt that China’s role in the development of African states, which grows with each passing year, must be viewed in a positive light, despite reservations concerning the priority of actions. We have to find ourselves an answer to whether commercial investments are more important than humanitarian assistance. For poor African states, any aid is important, just as water is important, and also the fight against diseases, education, the construction of infrastructure and peace. There is only one conclusion: we must work together to develop the best methods for sustainable yet accelerated and durable development for these states.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, in Article 65 of her thorough report, Mrs Gomes calls on the European Union and China not to pursue arms trade deals with African governments that are guilty of human rights violations, are involved in conflicts or are on the brink of war. I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur on that point. The same goes for the concrete examples that she gives, and in the list of African states, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe most certainly stands out these days.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Late last week the Western press reported a large-scale Chinese arms supply to the Mugabe regime via South Africa, as if the internal tension in Zimbabwe had not mounted enough as a result of all of the presidential voting machinations. ‘For Zimbabwe, going to China is going to our second home’, said President Mugabe during his last visit to Beijing, approximately one and a half years ago. When will the Chinese authorities truly dissociate themselves from this and other African ‘friends’? Commissioner, I expect that you will be asking this pressing question in Beijing. Mrs Gomes’s report also gives cause for this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, after everything that you have said, let us examine China’s presence in Africa. For this I will continue in Polish.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, at the beginning of the last century, Chinese nationals came to English and French houses as exotic servants. In the 1950s and 1960s we had Chinese products: pens and various products for schools; and now the Chinese have appeared as a powerful economic and political force.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As you say, everyone has a right to act on the economic and political stage and no-one will bar them from doing so, but the Chinese have aggregated their efforts and are moving towards their goals with a certain plan; but what are the goals they strive for? Unencumbered by any stain or label of colonialism, they can and will exploit natural resources in Africa. I am putting it bluntly – exploit. Further, and worse, they can and already are exporting their totalitarian socio-political model, and Africa needs protecting from this. Africa needs saving from this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe has traditional links from colonial days to what is nicely termed ‘cooperation’. Both from a humanist perspective and also from a sense of guilt, we should make a constructive contribution to Africa in every aspect. We are doing this, but the Chinese are squeezing us out. In parallel with this superpower, the EU too should gain Africa’s trust and at the same time show its readiness to contribute to developing this large continent, which is so near to us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, we are faced with an enormous challenge.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, renewed interest in Africa throughout the world is attended by a change in perspective. Today Africa is more than just a continent of poverty. There are growth rates of up to 10% in some African countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now to the heart of the matter: what is China looking for in Africa? Its most important motive for commitment there is energy resources. In the battle for access to raw materials, however, Western value-based policy draws the shorter straw increasingly frequently. Europe’s most important motive is Africa’s sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="de">A joint EU-Chinese plan for Africa would be ideal in theory. We should not be claiming to be the good guys here, because the countries of Africa mistrust the EU just as much as China. The EU cannot provide solutions for either China or Africa. In any case the EU must carry on tying commitment to conditions. At the same time it should be promoting governments, institutions and civil society more strongly than it has hitherto. Dialogue with Africa is necessary, but should not overlook grievances. On this note I can but support Mrs Gomes’s report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I congratulate my colleague Ms Ana Gomes for her work and her comprehensive and realistic assessments. As the report shows, China is already an important economic and political partner for Africa. Regarding Africa’s development, I believe that there is so much work to do on this continent and that China, as a new player, should be welcome to participate.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, what I strongly fear is that instead of channelling its support in constructive endeavours – health, education, poverty reduction and infrastructure – China would continue to engage in feeding the tragedies of the continent and will do it by arms trafficking and undermining whatever steps African countries make towards democracy, good governance and respect for human rights. The Chinese ship carrying guns for Zimbabwe again calls into question China’s real commitment to contributing to peace and security in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many African countries welcome their cooperation with China as there is no political conditionality linked to the economic benefits, but the EU should continue to strongly advocate, both to China and the African countries, institution building, human rights advancement and more transparent rules regarding the exploitation of natural resources. Recent developments have shown that, even in those cases where in the last couple of years governments started to show more openness on how public money and resources were spent, they have gone back to a less transparent administration. The EU has the duty to help China to become a trusted partner in development cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, despite the lively trade between China and African countries, and even despite the fact that China has recently become a net donor with regard to Africa, it is still Europe, not China, that African emigrants choose, despite our colonial past. This is the best proof of Africans’ preference for our values, such as respect for human rights and concern for sustainable development that guarantees a better future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This gives the European Union a moral right, but also a duty, to examine Chinese policy vis-à-vis Africa, since, as the rapporteur rightly stresses, China could significantly accelerate the process of sustainable development in Africa, but could equally harm it. In view of this, the idea of holding trilateral talks between the European Union, African Union member states and China is particularly worthy of support.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Chinese courtship with Africa is not just about military cooperation, strategically important raw materials, large-scale investment and the creation of an enormous market for Chinese products; it is also about building infrastructure. The volume of trade has multiplied five-fold since 2000 and will soon total USD 100 billion, although Western trade is for the moment still responsible for up to two thirds of African trade revenue. The Chinese policy is based on the concept of ‘non-interference’ and comparative economic advantage. This means exporting cost-effective goods and weapons in exchange for raw materials. Investment and long-term contracts represent elements of a premeditated long-term Chinese strategy that has no compassion for Africa.</p>
      <p sl="cs">China’s influence on African countries is a dangerous example of a totalitarian model, and a corrupt market model, devoid of any respect for individuals or human rights, or any respect for the environment. The Chinese hunger for raw materials in exchange for unconditional supplies of weapons to Africa is becoming a bigger and bigger obstacle in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We have to force China to accept its share of the responsibility for development policy, poverty reduction and sustainable growth. China is, after all, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and as such has a responsibility for the developments in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I condemn China’s support for the Sudanese regime. I support a dialogue with China on harmonising policies in Africa with a view to reducing poverty, but I am not holding my breath. We must not give up, however. We must put a stop to the plundering of raw materials and help Africa to become economically independent. We must adhere to our strategy of trade policies based on respect for human rights and environmental protection. I pray to God that we can achieve this.</p>

We clearly all agree that a common European Union position here would be very welcome.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to focus on a couple of points. First the global approach: we should view cooperation between China and Africa from a global perspective, not from the viewpoint that Africa is traditionally an area of exclusively European influence.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, China has begun to increase substantially its diplomatic and economic links with Africa over the last decade, largely because of a demand for raw materials. Chinese trade with this continent has quadrupled since 2001, with a scramble for resources also having negative consequences and perpetuating corrupt and oppressive elites in Africa. An example of such a repressive regime would be Sudan, where CNPC – a Chinese state-owned oil company – controls an estimated 60-70% of Sudanese oil production, while Sudan is also a major recipient of Chinese arms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Political conditions in respect of governance, democracy and human rights are very often not attached to China’s dealings with Africa. China has severe problems itself at home concerning good governance, respect for human rights and core labour standards. This country seems to be in no position to make its aid dependent on improvements in African standards of human rights, when it does not abide by those same standards itself. Nevertheless, China’s policy of non-interference in the domestic state affairs of its economic partners has now become too convenient an excuse, giving China carte blanche to continue its sometimes reckless contracts, particularly on the continent of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">This policy of non-interference, with China’s lenient attitudes towards questionable regimes, such as those in Sudan, is a continued issue of concern to be addressed. Unfortunately, as China’s predominantly bilateral approach to Africa runs counter to the EU’s primarily multilateral approach, the EU is being somewhat left behind. Corrupt African leaders prefer to sign lucrative deals that do not come with demands attached and so the EU appears to be missing out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, the EU should uphold its traditional policy of positive conditionality aimed at fostering sustainable development and should not be tempted to nuance its approach to Africa simply because China is landing more contracts. Instead, the EU needs to press China to adopt more criteria for development in its relations with Africa. China is a major power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and therefore has responsibilities in Africa and all over the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I congratulate my colleague, Ms Gomes, on an excellent report. This report strengthens our relationship with China, which is necessary to underpin the global economy. Until recently, and for thousands of years, China only exercised soft power, as we now do in the EU, but China is changing. She is a superpower, both economically and militarily, and she is in transition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our relationship with China must be based on respect. It cannot be a relationship where either party feels entitled to lecture or hector the other. We ended the Cold War by engaging with the Soviet Union and we brought peace to Europe. Similarly, we must engage with China at all levels. We must preserve the institutions that underpin our rules-based global liberal economy and values, otherwise we are finished.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means China playing a full and active role in all the post-war Bretton Woods institutions that we have so carefully built. It also means working with China to strengthen the rules of the international order so that it serves our interest and hers. By 2020, China’s economy will be the largest in the world. We now have a choice. Either we empower China to play a full and active role in the liberal open-to-all rules-based multilateral institutions built after Bretton Woods – and this includes the EU, the ACP, Rio, Bali, in addition to the UN, WTO, IMF and the World Bank – or, we force China, through our short-termism, to withdraw and inevitably, in time, to destroy these institutions and build her own, to suit her superpowers, institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why this report is so timely. That is also why – and I am being controversial here – the Olympic Games in Beijing are so important, because this is the first time in history that China is engaging with the whole world.

      <p sl="en">Our task at the beginning of the 21st century is an enormous one. It has never been done before in the entirety of our common human history, but it must be done. That task is to engage the oldest and largest nation on earth in all the affairs of the planet Earth as our partner.</p>

I think that as far as the European Union is concerned China is not only an important trading partner but also a serious competitor. The report by Mrs Gomes corroborates my personal experience.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I had the opportunity of seeing the astonishing diligence of cheap labour. Even though China has to cope with great social and economic inequalities and an alarmingly deteriorating environment, and even though political rights and fundamental freedoms are still very limited, it has a great deal of experience that can be beneficial to African countries. Africa is fighting poverty but it is rich in raw materials. Thanks to the demand from China and other parties, African states can gain a better foothold on the markets.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At present the EU is the biggest donor of aid to Africa and its most important trading partner. China’s ambition is to become Africa’s largest trading partner by 2010; its actions in Africa therefore present a serious challenge for the EU.</p>

The Chinese are building bridges, roads, stadiums, hospitals, they are supplying Africa with weapons, they are issuing financial loans, and in this way they are gaining for themselves a new sales market while at the same time posing as a state that cares about Africa’s future.</p>

This practical case is Zimbabwe. Newspaper reports tell of a ship, coming from where? From China. Loaded with what? With arms, arms for Zimbabwe, small arms, grenades and mortars. It was prevented from unloading in Durban, but there are reports of it heading to Angola to deliver those weapons to be used to harm the people of Zimbabwe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, over the last 10-15 years China has become the most rapidly developing economy in the world, as witnessed by the 10% plus annual increase in its national income. This has led to this country becoming the fourth largest economy in the world, with the world’s largest foreign currency reserves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such a rapid development in economic potential means that China is becoming one of the world’s leading trade partners. Over the past 15 years, the value of trade between China and Africa has increased 20 times over. It looks as if the European Union is not in a position to counter this expansion. We therefore need to encourage China to ensure that its economic involvement in Africa includes a social and an environmental aspect, as well as maintenance of democratic standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union should keep tabs on China’s expansion in Africa. We do, after all, continue to be the greatest donor to African countries.

      <p sl="fr">Obviously it is extremely frustrating for MEPs, in a debate as important as this one and with such an excellent report, to have so little time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply like to acknowledge the fact that I have seen two camps emerge here in Parliament. There are those – and I am not being critical, I am simply saying that this is what I have observed – there are speakers who believe that pessimism and fear will get the Chinese out of Africa. Forget it, clearly that is not going to happen. Personally, I have an unshaken belief in the optimism that comes from modernity and openness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have heard other things here today that make me think that we need to realise that this kind of relationship with Africa is exactly what is making Africa lose faith in Europe. However, we must stop believing that we have a moral right to be in Africa. We have no right to be in Africa, none whatsoever, whether moral or otherwise. Our past certainly gives us no right to think this and I would just like to remind everyone of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the same vein, I heard the Chinese being criticised for stealing our natural resources from Africa! I am sorry, I do not know whether Mr Coûteaux is still here, perhaps it was a slip of the tongue. Still, as if we owned natural resources in Africa! It is really quite amazing. I will be honest with you: this kind of comment rather surprises me at times.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would tell you that the only danger I see in China's presence, in Chinese investment in Africa, is the resource curse for Africans. This is something we need to discuss with Africans. It is what is known as the ‘resource curse’ or ‘rentier economy’. This subject must be raised in our talks with Africa. I am a great believer in dialogue, in tripartite partnership, in feedback and in a mutual understanding of problems, as well as in the search for real cooperation. For others more prone to sermonising, this amounts to saying that ‘we Europeans must give lessons on how to protect these poor Africans from the Chinese’. I must tell you that I encounter these sorts of arguments every single day in my bilateral relations. They are pointless and I do not engage in them, nor do I expect anyone else to engage in them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report by Mrs Gomes is on the right track. Personally I think that almost everything the report says is on the right track. As you know, I am leaving for China in a few hours. I will meet with the Chinese Minister for Trade. President Barroso and I will meet with the Chinese Prime Minister. Do you honestly think that we will not talk about human rights, about Tibet, about democracy, about Africa? Of course we will, in the singular vernacular of conventional diplomacy. Megaphone diplomacy, in this case, is totally counterproductive. The more you say to Africans, the more you go and tell them that they must be wary of the Chinese, that they are determined to colonise African countries, that this is the resource curse, the more you say that, the less they will hear you and the less they will want to listen to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has the tools to achieve its ambition. It can do this in two ways. Firstly, we have our model, which we must defend. We have to be different from others because our model is different from other models. It is founded on shared values, it is founded on tolerance, it is founded on openness, it is founded on dialogue, it is founded on feedback, it is founded on mutual respect. This is Europe, and Europe should not have to change. Europe does not have to become anything else or chase after other models. That is the first thing I wanted to say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing is as I said earlier. If we had a bit of courage – and the European Parliament can help us enormously here and indeed has already done so – to persuade Member States to divide the work better, to tweak the rules on the use of the European Development Fund, if we gave a bit more to the European institutions, if Parliament – by budgetising the EDF for example, which would then become much more effective politically – allocated more resources to Commissioners so that they could act in accordance with Europe’s values, using EDF funding, then I guarantee that Europe would not have to worry about competition with China. That is a fact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is some basis for this, because we have a formidable advantage. What advantage do we have? We are not about giving loans, we offer grants. I am not explaining myself properly. Africans today are turning to the Chinese and criticising us for not being responsive enough, even though we offer grants – in other words, money that they do not have to pay back – as opposed to soft loans which, it must be said, absorb natural resources. However, if these loans are used for infrastructure, for sustainable development, then who can argue that Africa does not benefit from this? As you know, when it comes to infrastructure in Africa, Europe, Europe and China, Europe, China and the US, Europe, China, Japan and the US, even the rest of the world, could offer as much funding as they want, it would still take years before there is enough infrastructure in Africa to support any real development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, all this money, all these investments, they are not necessarily a bad thing. The real question is knowing how it is all used, how it is all managed. I know that I cannot make everybody agree, but that is the beauty of democracy. I sincerely believe that it is through openness, through dialogue, through the search for a triangular partnership, in this case, that we will make a difference. In my opinion, Europe will always remain a special partner of Africa for historical reasons, for geographical reasons, for model reasons. I am not afraid of that and I believe that, if we truly want to be present in Africa – as someone said, this is very important – we must do as I suggest and add another ingredient to the mix. We must stop implying that our interest in Africa is based solely on generosity, kindness and humanity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly we also have a duty in that respect, but we need to accept that a relationship with Africa represents an enormous win-win potential for Europe. It offers enormous potential for mutual economic development, and there is absolutely nothing wrong or immoral in looking at things from that perspective. At least the Chinese have one good quality: they make no secret of their plans. I have never heard the Chinese say that they want to help Africans or to foster development in Africa. No, they are honest. They play by the rules of economic development, this is their primary interest. Personally I believe that if we want to respect our partners, then we must accept this. We must not dismiss this aspect. There is no miracle solution. If Africa does not develop economically, it will not develop at all, period, and our charitable policies will make no difference.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I wanted to say. I am sorry, Madam President, for taking so long, but I have expressed a belief that comes from my experience with these countries every day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One final thing, for what it is worth. The Chinese ship is heading back to China for now. People have always said that Europe has little political influence. I have just come back from the SADEC Summit, where I spoke with heads of state. Zimbabwe was obviously on the agenda. I spoke with all the heads of state: Angola, Mozambique, all of them. I clarified the question of the Chinese ship. It was the dockers who reacted, but various countries also refused to unload the ship. According to the latest information that I have, the ship was sent back to China. For what it is worth, Europe has tried to do its duty with soft diplomacy and with the dockers, obviously with the voice of the people. This was all worthwhile, and it proves that Africans are not prepared to accept just anything when it comes to diplomacy, or politics for that matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to recall that our colleague Erika Mann, who was the draftswoman for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, could not be here. She asked me to stress this point which we have included in the report: it is about the importance for Africa of developing its own strategy towards China, noting that such a strategy can enhance the reciprocal nature of trade relations between China and Africa if it is focused on greater participation by African workers in Chinese projects in Africa, greater willingness on the part of China to transfer technology, and better access to Chinese markets for African exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to thank Commissioner Michel and my other fellow Members for their comments and for the valid questions raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I understand the Commissioner when he says that Europe cannot unilaterally dictate terms for Africa, particularly when China does not apply them. However, this is precisely why we as Europeans must invest more to strengthen African civil society, institutions such as parliaments, free media, universities, etc. so that Africans themselves can demand and impose conditions, such as those emerging from the MDGs, and ensure that these are respected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am in complete agreement with the Commissioner, as is evident in the report, when he says that the rapid disbursement of aid or European funding is vital for Africa and that coordinated action and the sharing of tasks between Member States and the Commission is essential if we are to compete with the ease with which China finances Africa at the moment, without weighing up the consequences, apart from its own interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of the OECD criteria, clearly it is up to China to decide whether these are worth adopting. However, I believe that it is our role, based on our positive and negative experiences in Africa, to make China understand that its long-term interest is to ensure that Africa’s natural resources are exploited and not decimated, and that, without good governance, there are no guarantees, not even for China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, perhaps one of the positive consequences of China’s increasing presence in Africa is this debate and the report that we are going to adopt tomorrow. China has helped Europe to understand that there is enormous potential in Africa and that there are success stories in Africa. I sincerely hope that your trip to China this week, Commissioner, will be an opportunity for you to foster the constructive engagement by China and Africa outlined in this report, and to remind China, as you said today, of its responsibilities as permanent member of the UN Security Council not only with regard to Tibet and Myanmar, but also Africa, and specifically Zimbabwe and Darfur. Congratulations, Commissioner, if your actions did in fact help send the ship back to China. This is very positive.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report by Mrs Gomes is undoubtedly a detailed and interesting analysis of the presence of the People’s Republic of China in Africa. I cannot, however, rid myself of the impression that somewhere between trade, investments, infrastructure, energy and other important matters, we have lost sight in this report of a matter that is of fundamental importance from the aspect of both the institution that we represent – the European Parliament – and the Committee on Development, which is responsible for this report. Protection of human rights throughout the world is an absolute priority of the European Parliament – we see this on the homepage of the European Parliament’s website. If we really do believe in this slogan, we cannot restrict ourselves in the section on governance and human rights to:</p>
      <p sl="en">a perfunctory summary of the involvement of China (this being placed in as positive a context as possible) in Darfur, whereas we all surely know perfectly well that there has been no improvement whatsoever in the region;</p>
      <p sl="en">a single-sentence reference to violation of the UN embargo on arms sales in Africa by the People’s Republic of China – which, let us not forget, is a permanent member of the UN Security Council;</p>
      <p sl="en">or to the brief commentary on the subject of Chinese cooperation with governments responsible for human rights violations, such as Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The EU should not underestimate the power of privately and publicly criticising China’, as Mrs Gomes writes in the justification for her report. It is a pity that we have missed just such an opportunity with this report. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The report by Mrs Gomes is a vital contribution to the debate on this major challenge to international cooperation. Once again I thank her for her clear-sightedness.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the one hand, it would appear that Africa has benefited from its economically close relations with China. The economic boost given to it by its most important trading partner, Europe aside, has reduced poverty. China looks on Africa not as a burden, but as an opportunity full of economic potential.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the other hand, it has become evident that there are some very worrying aspects of China’s position in Africa. The export of weapons, unhealthy investment, the exploitation of raw materials – Europe knows the signs of neocolonialism amid all the zeal all too well. It is worth asking if economic power should be used to encourage an obsession with becoming a superpower. This is apparent, for example, in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another question is how the EU should react. In many ways China is Europe’s rival in Africa, and several here have said that lecturing a self-respecting rising superpower will not do any good. The report wisely opts for a constructive approach. Therein we need to identify our role, which is to remind China of the obligations which partnership brings with it. Joint efforts need to be made to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, prevent conflict and guarantee sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Cooperation is of the utmost importance in curbing climate change. Bali brought the hope that China, as a major polluter, and Africa, as an innocent victim, would be involved.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, we need to acknowledge the fact that China does not share European notions of respect for human rights. That is why we must make far more of an effort to ensure that lasting democracy, the rule of law and good governance take root in Africa. The eventual solution to the Chinese challenge is to be found not in China, but in Africa itself.</p>

      <p sl="en">The rising power that is China is having an enormous impact on the process of sustainable development in Africa, but we must bear in mind that African states are responsible for the overall impact of the presence of foreigners and foreign organisations or governments on their territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the EU and China are acting to promote security, peace and sustainable development in Africa, but the EU is the greatest donor and the main trade partner for Africa as things currently stand. Although China has a raft of positive experience through lifting 400 million of its own citizens out of extreme poverty over the past 25 years, we must nevertheless concentrate on the enormous social and economic inequities, as well as the alarming degradation of the natural environment, the restriction of fundamental freedoms and low employment standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must monitor the exploitation of African natural resources, as it may lead to their total exhaustion and the spread of corruption, as well as to a deepening of social inequality and the instigation of conflicts, which will have a negative impact on the development of African countries. It is precisely the Western states’ trade and consumption that is having the effect of increasing China’s demand for African natural resources, resulting in increasing CO2 emissions in developing countries. No less important is the fact that WTO membership brings in its train a series of obligations that China is inadequately honouring. The EU should raise the issue of justice in relation to trade, climate and other problems as part of trilateral cooperation with China and Africa.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the most disturbing fact about China's policy in Africa is that they are providing non-conditional aid and investments there. The development assistance that the European Union contributes has always been bound with strict conditions concerning democratic progress, recognition of the rule of law and good governance as well as respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">China's pragmatic "no conditions" cooperation with repressive regimes in Africa undermines the efforts that the European Union has made to incite democratic state-building in Africa and challenges us to introduce some new more flexible policies on Africa. Conditional aid, although being sometimes extremely effective, can also be perceived as patronizing and China, in pursuit to satisfy its growing need for resources, has avoided its use.</p>
      <p sl="en">China's growing interest and involvement in Africa endangers European interests there and in order not to lose ground in Africa we must come forward with some new more attractive means to encourage democratic transition in African countries. But on the other hand we must not shy away from a constructive dialogue between the European Union and China as well as other major contributors who might be interested in forming a coherent multilateral strategy on Africa.</p>

      <p sl="en">Napoleon told us that we should let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world. Bad news: China has arisen, yet we have slumbered away. We are still dealing with the legacy of colonial rule, in both the colonised and colonising states, but we have ignored the possibility that this tragedy might occur again. The accusation that China is exercising neo-colonialism is not at all unjustified. China has the same interests in exploiting African countries as some of our European states have had over the centuries. We have learned our lessons at great cost, but China has yet to learn how to implement human rights internally while already experimenting in colonial rule. We are on a dangerous course with China’s thirst for oil and the hunger that it exerts for African resources. We should send a clear signal to China: first deal with the internal human rights record, then show the world that it genuinely wants to engage in Africa’s development goals rather then just using them instrumentally.</p>

    <intervention id="2-494" speaker_id="4482" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0042/2008) by Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the implementation of the programming of the 10th European Development Fund [2007/2138(INI)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-495" speaker_id="2031" name="Marie-Arlette Carlotti" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, development assistance has been in the headlines in recent days, although unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2007, EU aid fell for the first time since 2000. This is an appalling political message that we are sending out to the countries and peoples of the South, at a time when the most fragile of them are being hit by the food crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament supports the Commission, supports you, Commissioner, in reiterating the commitment of the EU at the European Summit in Brussels and insisting on a tight schedule. We have a twofold responsibility in terms of international solidarity: first, keeping our word, and second, the guarantee that our aid will make a tangible and effective contribution towards combating poverty. This is what is at stake in the implementation of the 10th EDF and almost EUR 22.7 billion over the next six years. I believe that the EU has a major weapon here for tackling poverty and building a fairer world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why we are extremely concerned by the delays in the ratification process. Granted, the Commission has committed to the continuity of funding, at least temporarily, but the situation could very quickly become untenable for the most fragile African countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our first priority for the 10th EDF is democratic scrutiny. Democratic scrutiny of the European Parliament, first of all, with the budgetisation of the EDF – and this time I hope that we will not miss the deadline for the review of the financial perspectives in 2010 – and democratic scrutiny of national parliaments, with a reinforced capacity-building programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would also like education and health to be priority action areas and to be allocated 20% of EDF funds. However, there are only plans to grant allocate 6.1% of aid to these areas, and even this figure has fallen compared with the 9th EDF. The Commission says that it will achieve the 20% target through budgetary support, and we take it at its word.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also underlines shortcomings in terms of the gender dimension, which is not currently an area of action in its own right. We need to reopen this debate in consultation with our ACP partners, their parliaments and civil society, during the mid-term review in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for budgetary support, I personally have always believed that this was a good instrument, provided of course that it respects democracy, good governance and coordination between donors. Since we believe that budgetary support must serve the Millennium Development Goals, we are encouraging the Commission to go down this path with its MDG contracts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the new incentive tranche proposed in the 10th EDF, of course we say yes to a good governance ‘premium’, but no to a governance profile, which would primarily reflect the interests of the North. I would like to talk about the fight against terrorism, immigration, etc.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will also be vigilant on the question of EPA funding. Here too, the EU and the Member States have made a commitment: an additional EUR 2 billion in aid for trade between now and 2010. However, it seems that this EUR 2 billion has melted away and that the Commission is already planning to finance EPAs from integrated regional programmes. It must clarify its intentions on this subject, because EDF funds, as far as we are concerned, should not be used as a reward for signing an EPA.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report makes a number of other points, although I do not have time to go into these. I will just mention two others before finishing. Firstly, the African Peace Facility. Obviously we must support the efforts of the African Union for peace and the prevention of conflict on the continent, but I believe that this instrument comes under the CFSP, and so must be financed from CFSP funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of co-financing, the report calls for an initial tangible application, i.e. the creation of a ‘pan-African development fund’, jointly funded by the EDF and the neighbourhood instrument.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is more or less the content of my report, for better or worse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Michel, you recently said that ‘we are the first generation that can face up to extreme poverty and state with genuine conviction: we have the money, the medicines and the science to end poverty. The question is, do we have the will?’ Well, on this point, Mr Michel, Parliament is right behind you.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-496" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate you for this excellent report, which has given me an opportunity to express myself to you on points of mutual interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say that I am pleased with the similarities between the viewpoints of our institutions, as exemplified by this report. It is clear that the overarching aim of our actions is first and foremost the fight against poverty in the context of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this sense, the 10th European Development Fund, which is about to be launched, is the first real opportunity for the European Union to deploy the European consensus and agenda on the efficiency of aid. Firstly, the amount. The budget has significantly increased, from EUR 17.9 billion for the 9th EDF to EUR 22.6 billion for the 10th EDF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also delighted to inform you that, for the first time in the EDF’s history and so since European cooperation began, the Commission has been able to commit all remaining balances from previous EDFs at 31 January 2007, without a single euro being lost due to the sunset clause imposed by Member States on the 9th EDF, as the report asks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the meantime, nearly all country strategies of the 10th EDF have been completed. So far, 58 strategy papers have been forwarded to the EDF Committee, 14 are expected between now and next June and plans for their implementation are already under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On its ratification by the ACP, the 10th EDF could be rolled out immediately and without any hangover from the past, while its implementation cycle could be aligned with the previous budgetary cycle. This is just the first step, and I will continue to campaign, as you do, for full budgetisation of the EDF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your support is also vital for us to be able, once and for all, to shift cooperation with ACP countries away from an intergovernmental approach and to integrate it fully into the Community budget and codecision procedures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Budgetisation will also satisfy your demands, which I fully endorse, for full democratic scrutiny of the EDF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have already agreed on the principle that strategy papers must be automatically forwarded to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Clearly this is not enough; I have already instructed our delegations to send country strategy papers to members of national parliaments and I am also personally committed to raising awareness in our partner countries so that they can involve their national parliaments in monitoring Community cooperation. A first meeting with the Ghanaian government looks set to take place, although as you know, the last-minute change to my calendar – in other words the SADEC Summit on Zimbabwe, which I have just come back from – forced me to postpone it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that the main advantage of the country strategies prepared by ACP countries in the programming of their national budgets for the 10th EDF lies in the fact that they have made governance the focus of our mutual relations. This is why, when the 10th EDF funds were allocated, we decided to introduce a governance-related incentive tranche of almost EUR 3 billion. This is not, as someone mistakenly said, another form of conditionality, but a premium allocated based on the relevance, realism and ambition of the governance plans drawn up by our partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the interests of autonomy and transparency, governance plans are annexed to the strategy papers and are therefore accessible to everyone. Similarly, criteria such as appropriation, effectiveness and focus on results have led me to call for greater use of budgetary support than in conventional projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">45% of our aid for ACP countries will be allocated out of national budgets, both as budgetary support for specific sectors and as general budgetary support. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some points of the report, which seem to have arisen from a misunderstanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report criticises the lack of funding for the health and education sectors. This is long-standing quarrel between the European Parliament and the Commission, I know. I can only repeat that the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the MDGs cannot happen solely through direct aid for the health and education sectors. Obviously, a significant proportion of general or sectoral budgetary support, when it is allocated, will be used to pay wages, for example of teachers, to build health clinics and to provide social services. I am convinced that at least 20%, or 6% in total, has been qualified and directly indicated. Obviously the rest will come from direct or sectoral aid, although I promise to try to quantify and prove this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By the way, obviously we do not have the right to choose sectors for our partners; it is up to them to choose these. Choices are also made based on bilateral aid. Many countries choose health or education for example, but it is a good question and so I will try to objectify it and give you the results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, you are right about the gender dimension. I am the first person to recognise the role of women in development and the need to promote this role. However, yet again, in the interests of efficiency, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been forced to recognise, with the adoption of the European consensus, that gender issues, taking into account their implications, have a cross-disciplinary dimension and that they must therefore be integrated into all relevant aid programmes, preferably within the limited framework of a particular sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where you do have my full support is where you commented on EDF funding for the African Peace Facility; no one can deny the evident links between development and security. Nevertheless, financing for peacekeeping actions should not be classed as development or deducted from development resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in principle, you are right. Unfortunately, you know how these things work. I think that it is absolutely crucial to lay the emphasis, as you are doing, on national parliaments, to structure and institutionalise consultation with governments and to increase the role of civil society while building its capacity and representativeness so that it can become a driver of development and democratic openness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you for this report, which I promise I will put to good use and from which I will undeniably draw inspiration.</p>

      <p sl="sl">() Rooting out poverty within the millennium development framework is a huge and demanding task. It includes not only tasks from the social sphere, but also a wider spectrum of topics that enable the human race to develop sustainably. Efficient utilisation of the 10th European Development Fund can substantially contribute to realisation of this objective.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I agree with the rapporteur that education and healthcare are two of the basic areas involved in improving the quality of life of the poorest populations. We must adequately increase the share of funds assigned to these two areas in the European Union’s development assistance, including also the 10th European Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, at a time of global challenges such as climate change, this is not enough. Nowadays, in parallel with economic growth and growth in GDP, greenhouse gas emissions are also growing. It is because of this, despite economic progress in other areas, that in some areas the wellbeing of the population is in decline. When we are designing all our development policies, we must define wellbeing within the framework of sustainable development. That is why it is important for the 10th European Development Fund to reflect the balance between the economic, social and environmental components.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Another area that I should like to mention is gender equality. Women in society have various roles, from concerns and responsibilities for the family’s basic subsistence to passing on of knowledge and life patterns to their children. Frequently, however, women have no privileges, no possibility of becoming independent and making their own decisions, and do not have equal access to services. That is why I believe that ensuring equal opportunities is one of the fundamental horizontal – I repeat, horizontal – building blocks of any development policy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, I should like to say that a policy can be successful only if it obtains suitable support from the population, which is reflected through democratic and honest elections. In future, parliaments should play a much more important role in drawing up, controlling and implementing development policies – not just the European Parliament, but also Member State parliaments.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Carlotti, I would first of all like to congratulate you for the excellent work carried out in drafting this report, which was expertly done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from the reminder that it is now urgent to encourage our partners to ratify the 10th EDF, I would like to revisit some of the issues that, for us European Socialists, are essential in view of the current challenges facing the populations of the South; challenges that are tragically highlighted by the current food crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, we need a better understanding of agriculture, which represents an inadequate proportion of the European Development Fund. As a reminder, 9 out of 78 countries in the 9th EDF, and only 8% of amounts allocated in the 10th EDF, covered agriculture and rural development initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also the late implementation of the increase announced by the Commission as part of its support for the development of agriculture in southern countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is imperative that we monitor the coherence of our policies and those of the Member States compared with the priorities expressed in the 10th EDF, mainly in terms of the common agricultural policy, because no development policy can make sense while we continue to give with one hand what we take back with the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another important question for us is of course the gender dimension, particularly as we are aware of the central role of women in development in most of these countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the need, as mentioned this morning during the budget discharge debate, for the budgetisation of the EDF, which until now has evaded any parliamentary scrutiny, even though it is a budget of EUR 22.6 billion – as you reminded us, Commissioner – and as it accounts for most of our development resources. This appeal is directed more at the Council than at the Commission, with whom we have reached an agreement on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sorry, but I must underline what was said by my colleague Mrs Carlotti on the vigilance required so that the 10th EDF is not used as leverage or as a remedy for economic partnership agreements. Clearly this would not be responsible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Development Fund is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its creation. During this period it has become an important means of development cooperation with ACP countries, enhancing their economic and social development. During negotiations on the 10th EDF, the EU Member States have agreed on the importance of the Fund and the need to further encourage the development of the ACP countries along with increasing the Fund by EUR 10 billion compared with the 9th EDF. It would make the fight against poverty more efficient and allow us to continue with the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to highlight the fact that since 2008 the new EU Member States have started to contribute towards the 10th EDF budget. They are required to pay nearly EUR 820 million. However, the implementation of the 10th EDF has not yet begun, mainly because half of the ACP countries have failed to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement. I would therefore like to encourage the ACP countries to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Prior to the ratification of the current financial initiative, discussions took place on the incorporation of the EDF into the EU budget, the main idea being that it would enhance the efficiency of its implementation. We are still awaiting a decision on this issue. I would also like to urge the EU to allocate a more substantial part of the EDF funds to health services and education. Since 2001 the EU budget has provided for 20% of aid to be allocated to primary health care and education, and this should be applied to the EDF too. In view of the EDF innovations, I would like to emphasise the encouragement of good management. Although it is not fully clear how it would be done at present, I support the incorporation of additional criteria – the liberalisation of markets, the fight against terrorism, commitments on weapons of mass destruction and the readmission of migrants. The implementation of these criteria would contribute to enhancing stability in the ACP countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, programming implementation of the 10th European Development Fund in the period 2008-2013 is of considerable humanist and political significance. The aim of these programmes is to eliminate poverty and bring about social stability in partner countries and regions in the context of lasting development, especially in Africa. The efficacy of this aid established by the European Parliament, Member States and other donors, and assessed at many billions of euros, will be dependent on the proper designation of aims, the simplification of formal barriers, the harmonisation of actions and constant monitoring, part of which will be carried out by European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Aid in the economic sense should be linked to partnership agreements and should ensure development of the required infrastructure, enabling jobs to be created in the mining and processing industries and in agriculture. The sales market for products should be the European Union, with its lasting shortage of raw materials and certain products.

      <p sl="es">It should not be forgotten that the EDF does not fall within the Commission’s general financial aid, and therefore we can demand clear transparency and specific objectives for which this money is going to be used.</p>
      <p sl="es">EUR 23 billion for five years and 78 countries is not enough for everything, therefore according to what was agreed in the Paris Declaration of 2005, bilateral agreements always have to be reached on projects, plans and strategies to be followed, and I stress ‘bilateral agreements’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, even though we know that the general financial aid that is allocated to ACP countries is primarily focused on strategies to eradicate poverty, it would not be superfluous to ensure that the final objective of the EFD was the same.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the implementation of the 10th European Development Fund in the period from 2008 to 2013 falls at a time of exceptionally important challenges for the European and world development agenda. We can identify at least a few of these: implementation of the newly adopted joint EU-Africa strategy; implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, which are envisaged – as we all remember – for 2015; implementation of new economic partnership agreements ‘EPAs’; and the mid-term review of the financial perspective, set for 2009. Some particularly tough challenges are therefore facing us as far as programming, the introduction of new solutions and implementation of the 10th EDF are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, the rapporteur, Mrs Carlotti, has made a splendid job of this task; she has properly captured and summarised the most important aims and the difficult issues that will be a challenge in the implementation of the European Development Fund. I would like to draw attention to the two issues that I consider to be of the highest importance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The 10th European Development Fund envisages the disbursement of almost EUR 23 billion intended for cooperation with the poorest countries of the world. Properly utilised, the EDF can make a major contribution to the successful achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. For this reason, then, the absolute priority for our European perspective should be the first of the Millennium Development Goals – the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. We must therefore ensure that the executive regulation does in fact concentrate on the implementation of this aim, giving it priority over the other social aims. The other aims are important, but we should keep a constant eye on the priority of eradicating extreme poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, in order to increase the cohesion, transparency and efficiency of European development cooperation, the EDF should be included in the EU budget. The question of including the EDF in the budget should be discussed during a review of the financial perspective. I am aware that some Member States are afraid of this solution, but from the viewpoint of the Committee on Development, and probably that of the European Parliament as a whole, there is no doubt that this would be beneficial for European development policy.</p>

Europe’s presence in Africa has a long history, both positive and negative. Europe has the technology; Europe has the resources; Europe is developing its scientific knowledge. Europe can play an important role. What is more, Europe cannot afford to exist without Africa.’</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that the 10th European Development Fund (2008-2013) is an important instrument in terms of fulfilling the political obligations of the EU and its Member States to provide development assistance. This is why I call on the EU Member States and the ACP countries that have not yet ratified the Internal Agreement and the Amended Cotonou Agreement to do so, in the hope that the fund can become operational as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am going to be very brief because I did not realise, but basically I already answered a number of questions in my initial speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to go back to a point that was criticised by Mrs Carlotti – a very fair criticism, of course – which is that, at a time when we have never before faced so many challenges in terms of development, it should be said that our Member States are reducing their development assistance. In actual fact, we are going to lose EUR 1 700 000 000 - the first time that there has been a decrease. This is a huge sum. Imagine what it might be spent on in terms of hospitals, doctors and teachers for developing countries. Therefore, what the European Council is proposing, Mrs Carlotti, is that each Member State should at least confirm the commitment that it assumed, if you remember, in 2005, and agree to produce a transitional plan illustrating how they can reach the target set for 2010 and 2015. It is my belief that they will then be pinned down by the commitments they assumed publicly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing, Mr Hutchinson, is that you are right about the percentages. I would just like to say that, for agriculture and rural development, the 9th EDF was EUR 650 million and the 10th EDF is EUR 1 billion 250 million. It is an increase in absolute terms rather than percentage terms, you are right. Secondly, four countries chose agriculture originally, whereas now there are 25. However, this is not enough, it is still not ambitious enough, and we really had to lobby hard to get some countries to agree to this approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of the EPAs, we always have an exchange of views on this subject whenever we meet. However, it is very late now, and this has taken the edge off my enthusiasm for the subject. Despite this, I would simply like to confirm something that you will like. I have always said that those countries which do not sign an EPA clearly will not be penalised from a financial point of view, and that obviously the two things were unrelated. In no way will we use the budget or its implementation as pressure or as a form of blackmail to get them to sign an EPA. We have always said this, and this will not change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of ratification, I think that it was Mrs Budreikaité who raised this point. Today, all EU Member States have ratified. There are five partner countries which still have to ratify. I hope that this will be done by the end of the month, so that it can all start in June.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to restate my belief that the budgetisation of the European Development Fund would without a doubt allow us to be much more efficient, to have democratic scrutiny, to have involvement in and ownership of this development policy, as we do with other policies. In my opinion, this would offer a much greater scope for action, responsiveness, legitimacy and credibility. I hope that we can make those Member States which are still opposed see sense.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Thank you everyone for this debate and for staying so late. Thank you, Commissioner. I would like to say that, on official development assistance, Parliament is right behind you. I read your comments in the press; I know that it took courage to say certain things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to go back to two points. Firstly, the incentive tranche. As you know, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds this instrument. The decision-making process is not very clear. There is no scrutiny and no information for the European Parliament or the JPA, or for national parliaments, and as I said earlier, there are certain criteria in the governance profiles which cause us a problem. I will not repeat myself, but I think that this ambiguity would only be removed by only external control outside the Commission, i.e. scrutiny by the European Parliament, by national parliaments and by the JPA of how and under what conditions the incentive tranche is paid. I also think that this scrutiny should explicitly form part of the implementation of the EDF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On regional integration and the EPAs, personally I think that EPA financing must be additional to EDF funding. I heard what you said about this. However, we need clarification regarding the division of funds, integrated regional programmes, between regions and between ACP countries. We believe you when you say that there is no new conditionality, but we need this type of assurance and precision. In any case, thank you very much for staying so late.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The 10th EDF provides a long-term framework for cooperation and development of the EU with ACP countries. It stands at EUR 22.7 billion for the period 2008-2013 and is designed to help some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries. For this fund, which is the financial arm of European development policy, to be effective, we must go further than the asymmetrical contribution of Member States and integrate it into the Community budget. The budgetisation of European aid would in fact offer certain advantages, since assistance for ACP countries would be subject to the same programming and management rules as the EU’s other instruments for external action, thereby strengthening the coherence, transparency, effectiveness and democratic control of development cooperation. We must overcome the idea of ‘historic ties’ between certain Member States and overseas countries and territories, and make Africa and development a priority of the EU as a whole. If the EU wants these policies and programmes to be efficient, then it must continue modernising its external aid and include the EDF within the Community budget from 2009.</p>
