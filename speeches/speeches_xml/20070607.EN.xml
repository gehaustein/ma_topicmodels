      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much indeed for inviting me to visit your Parliament; the invitation is a timely one. As you are all aware, we are currently engaged in tackling a summit, the summit in question being that of the G8 in Heiligendamm, but we, too, are perfectly well aware that there is another looming up in about a fortnight’s time, and that one – as I am sure you will agree – will be an event with a decisive impact on Europe’s future, something about which you and we both hope all participants in the European Council are not in doubt either. I can, at any rate, assure you that I have never in my life had to have as many bilateral talks with my European partners and counterparts as I have had to do over the last couple of weeks, and other members of the German Federal Government, right the way up to our Chancellor, are of course doing likewise.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was only two and a half months ago that we – in Berlin, in Brussels and throughout Europe – celebrated 50 years of European unity. The European Union is a model of success. Speaking as a foreign minister who frequently has to travel around outside the borders of the European Union, I can tell you that it is a model that makes many people around the world envious of us. Somebody in Germany remarked that, even if the European Union had managed to keep Europe peaceful and stable for only 50 years, that would have been sufficient justification for its having been founded.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you know, it has been far more successful than that, for its borders are open and it forms a single market with 500 million people living in it. Although the European Union can point to disadvantaged regions that have now achieved growth and prosperity, we all know that this sort of success does not happen automatically and that there is no guarantee of similar successes over the next 50 years, and so it was that, even on 25 March, on Europe’s birthday, we knew that the task facing us today and the European Council in particular would not be easy ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">What this is about is nothing less than the creation of a renewed basis on which the European Union will function, a new treaty framework that will enable us to remain effective as an enlarged Union in the world of the twenty-first century. Laying the ground for successful treaty reform will be the main topic of the forthcoming European Council on 21 and 22 June.</p>
      <p sl="de">Much is being expected of the summit, and I believe we would be well advised not to encourage people to expect still more of it; as Balthasar Gracián put it back in the seventeenth century, ‘The real can never equal the imagined, for it is easy to form ideals but very difficult to realise them’. We would do well, then, to adopt a realistic approach to the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am, nevertheless, optimistic, for the EU has shown, particularly over recent months, that it is capable of resolute action when its Member States are ready for it. I am thinking here of the groundbreaking decisions taken on climate and energy at the last Spring Summit, which will serve, as the debate in Heiligendamm is showing, as, in some sense, benchmarks for the whole international debate on how to handle climate change; or you may want to take as examples two very contemporary European lawmaking projects, in the shape of the roaming regulation and the creation of a single European payment area, in both of which projects, I know, your House had a very considerable part to play.</p>
      <p sl="de">Among the things that the forthcoming European Council will be thinking about will be concrete policies that serve the people of Europe, responsible and forward-looking action in our dealings with the outside world, and I can tell you that we, quite apart from the big issue of the Constitution, will be concerning ourselves with such things as the efforts towards a common integration policy. While we did the right thing by joining with the North African transit countries in seeking solutions on which we can agree, we do know that any immigration policy must amount to more than just beefing up Frontex and toughening up the coastguards in the North African states, for the transit states need help, and, most of all, the states that most of the refugees coming to Europe have left need economic stabilisation. The joint talks that have now been arranged by the European ministers of the interior and of labour are very much to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another area of policy in justice and internal affairs that matters a great deal to people – particularly to those in the new Member States – is the extension of freedom to travel throughout the EU, and that is why we want to bring forward preparations for enlarging the Schengen area in such a way that the process can be completed in 2008. We will also, at the European Council, be submitting a report on the further development of the European Neighbourhood Policy. We have every interest – as your House agrees – in binding our southern and eastern neighbours as closely as possible to the European Union, and we will do so by means of increased sectoral cooperation – in energy, transport, participation in the internal market, adoption of EU law and through intensive exchange in education and culture, for example – and in these areas, much remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not least because I personally have had a hand in it, I am glad that it is possible to adopt a new EU strategy on Central Asia, a region that has not hitherto enjoyed much attention on Europe’s part, but one with which we must seek closer cooperation, not only – and let me take this opportunity to stress this – because of its economic possibilities, but also because it is very much affected by the instability on its southern borders, in Afghanistan and Iran, and because, since the regional tendency is towards moderate Islam, it will continue to be open to dialogue with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am, of course, well aware that the success of the European Council is not dependent on the issues that I have just briefly mentioned. All of them are important, but its success or failure will of course be measured in terms of another issue, namely the success of treaty reform within the European Union. I am aware of the great deal of backing that the Presidency has received from your House in this matter, and I want to thank you for it. Yesterday, I had a chance to have a brief look at the Crespo-Brok report, from which I see that you have managed to maintain the tricky balance between striving for a positive and ambitious result and maintaining the necessary realism without which an agreement cannot be reached.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are all familiar – for I find it described in the report – with the situation with which we are presented, in which 18 Member States have ratified. These 18 Member States are no easier negotiating partners for us than those which are in a different position with regard to the ratification process. As you know, there have been negative outcomes from some referendums, behind which lie people’s fears – fears felt, no doubt, not only in France and the Netherlands, fears that we were obliged – and still are obliged – to take seriously. Following the talks I have had with many of you, I see evidence in your House, too, of willingness to do likewise.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has to be said, though, that, to judge by the most recent surveys, people in Europe are not against Europe; far from it, they want an EU that is capable of action and efficient, that concentrates on the essentials, that tackles problems and really sorts them out.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that the great work of European reform, with which we embarked on this debate, goes a long way towards refuting the argument that still today underpins criticism of the EU, namely that it is too inefficient and too slow to take decisions, and so I am glad to hear, from all the people I have talked to around Europe, that they are willing to deliver the institutional reform package that I am convinced we so urgently need, for all of them know that it is institutional reform alone that will enable us to make Europe more democratic, more transparent and more efficient. Nor do I find any evidence of anyone believing that renegotiating this package of institutional reforms would put us in a better position.</p>
      <p sl="de">The discussions I have had have also given me the impression that there was general agreement on specific policies such as the European Union’s external actions, justice and home affairs, energy policy and the social dimension, where it was generally agreed that what we have achieved so far must be maintained. There is discussion as to whether anything needs to be added to specific policies, and I note that there is a predominant willingness to make additions in the fields of climate change protection and energy solidarity, to which the European Council has stated that particular importance is to be attached.</p>
      <p sl="de">I realise that you are looking with particular interest at the part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and an overwhelming majority, practically without exception, shares our view that we need to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding, that is to say, that we should hold fast to its binding legal character.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Others point out that its status as binding law must not be to the detriment of the Member States’ competences. I do believe in any case that we will manage to find a solution to this that will be endorsed by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I believe the consultations also showed is that people recognise that, by pressing on with this European reform, we are taking the idea of subsidiarity further, but there are, nevertheless, those who want to go further and again strengthen the hands of the national parliaments, and that is what much of the discussions with our European colleagues has been about. We understood what they wanted, and now we have to give it to them. While we will of course be submitting relevant proposals, I would argue that this should be done in a way that does not increase the opportunities for the use of the veto in Europe, for if the overall objective of making Europe effective is to remain intact, we must not allow the European institutional structure to be even more subject to vetoes than it already is.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I do, in any case, get the impression that all the interested parties take the Berlin Declaration seriously as regards the specific point that the elections to the European Parliament in 2009 are to take place on a renewed basis; there is a willingness to cooperate in this and – or so I would say following the talks I have had – even a new enthusiasm for it. It strikes me that a path is steadily being mapped out towards a solution that could bring forth agreement at the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is clear is that we have not yet reached our destination; there are still something like two weeks left before the European Council, and we are of course using this time primarily for further consultations with those with whom we have not yet worked out an agreement on the potential solutions that have so far come to light, but let me repeat that there is a real chance of an agreement being reached, and, if we fail to seize it, there will not be another.</p>
      <p sl="de">What will be crucial is that we summon up the shared political will to achieve an agreement. ‘Europe – succeeding together!’ – so we said at the outset of our presidency, and it will also be the motto for the forthcoming European Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">While I am aware that many of you in this House would have liked to hear even more in detail about the individual conversations with the European Member States, I would ask you to understand that we have to maximise the prospects for the Council’s success, and so I would not wish, by making them public, to throw away what we have achieved, slowly but surely, in many conversations over recent weeks.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Margot Wallström" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the next European Council will be a very important test of the European Union’s ability to deal with new and difficult challenges and to look ahead with ambition. The main issue, which will be the real test for the German Presidency, is the Treaty settlement, but the conclusions will touch on several other issues, and rightly so. It is important to show that the Union is willing to deliver the right policies for its citizens directly and by creating an effective and democratic Europe. This is all part of the same effort to move closer to citizens and to serve the common interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Steinmeier has given a comprehensive overview of the Council agenda, so let me touch upon just three issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, migration: the increasing challenges and opportunities posed by international migration must be addressed in a spirit of true solidarity. Recent events have underlined the importance of that. It means recognising that better coordination is needed to face up to the ever-increasing flows of migrants at our borders and in our seas but also to reap the benefits of migration for the labour market and for society at large. At the same time, illegal migration and trafficking in human beings are on the rise and require our immediate attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council will be asked to apply a comprehensive approach to migration to the EU’s eastern and south-eastern neighbours. The European Council should also pay attention to the need to further reinforce the management of our external borders. The Rapid Border Intervention Teams should become active very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the European Council will return to the crucial issue of HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a critically important public health issue for Europe. We can only tackle it together by ensuring political leadership from the top and the involvement of civil society at all levels. It requires devoting attention to prevention, research, surveillance, treatment, care and support inside the Union and in neighbouring countries. I would like to pay tribute to the German Presidency for keeping this issue on the agenda, despite the fact that this is not often recognised in media reports about the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, I would like to say a few words about climate change. It will not be at the core of the June Summit agenda but, in the wake of the G8 meeting, it would be impossible for the European Council to be silent on this issue. I want to assure this Parliament that the Commission is working very hard to meet the expectations of the European Parliament and the European Council and to maintain an ambitious and dynamic policy, both internationally and in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specific legislative proposals will be adopted by the Commission in the autumn and we intend to build on the European Union’s credibility and leadership in fighting climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those are some of the key policy issues that will be covered by the European Council. However, as we all know, the key issue will be to move forward to a Treaty settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I need not repeat here the urgency of the matter or its significance for Europe’s future. We discussed it here yesterday and our discussion on the Brok and Barón Crespo report left no doubts about what is at stake. I believe that we can be cautiously optimistic about the results, even though I understand that we should perhaps not raise expectations even higher.</p>
      <p sl="en">The German Presidency, as we have noted, has already made huge efforts over the last few months to build a new consensus among Member States. The Berlin Declaration reminded us of what we were trying to achieve together, how much we have in common and how Europe has made and will make a difference for the peoples of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, the Presidency has been listening to the position of Parliament, the Commission and every Member State. All have shown their willingness to find a solution to move Europe forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commission, the starting point for a new Treaty settlement is clear. In terms of serving Europe’s citizens, this discussion is not a theoretical institutional debate: the institutions are there to respond to citizens’ needs, to realise policy goals and to deliver results. They need the right way of working and the right standards of democracy, transparency and accountability. We cannot implement our agreed policies with one hand tied behind our back. We need the capacity to act in a changed environment in the Europe of a globalised world.</p>
      <p sl="en">What does this mean for the European Council? It means that we need a fair and balanced solution, able to command a true consensus. A second failure might have dramatic consequences for European construction.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it also means maintaining a high level of ambition. A lowest common denominator solution might bring short-term harmony, but it could also store up problems for the future. Simply introducing minor changes in the Treaty of Nice will not be sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the efforts to find a solution, and the first place to look for solutions is the Constitutional Treaty. Regarding the substance, the major part of that work remains valid. The changes introduced by the Constitutional Treaty are still pertinent and they need to be translated into reality, not questioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Community method must be protected, including the Commission’s right of initiative. A single-pillar structure and a single legal personality would tangibly enhance the Union’s capacity to speak with one voice and to act in a global world. Parliament’s enhanced role and the advances in qualified majority voting should be preserved.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we see it, the Constitutional Treaty also brought a very good solution on how to involve national parliaments, one that strikes the right balance between the role of national parliaments and the role of the European Parliament. Similarly, we will defend the legally binding force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which forms an integral part of the package agreed by the Convention and the IGC.</p>
      <p sl="en">We acknowledge that some changes must be made and we respect all those who have expressed their views in this regard. We will not run away from a serious discussion about the form of the text, the EU symbols or other areas that have been mentioned for discussion. As far as the form of the new text is concerned, we will do our utmost to ensure that any new text will be readable and accessible. Our position in the negotiations will be ambitious and firm.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also add a point that is closely linked to our debate on the Treaty settlement. We do not just need a deal among the institutions and the Member States; we are equally in need of a new narrative, a new way to explain to citizens what is at stake. We need to explain why the enlarged Union needs a new Treaty that provides more democracy, more coherence and a Union strong enough to meet citizens’ expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s citizens welcome the EU’s commitment to tackling today’s key policy challenges: climate change, migration, energy – the areas that Mr Steinmeier has already mentioned. This is what they expect, but we have not yet succeeded in persuading them to make the connection between effectiveness in these areas and an appropriate Treaty settlement. All too often people still feel that the debate on the Treaties and the Constitution is the preserve of a rather small Brussels clique. We need to show that it is a question of having the right tools to serve agreed political objectives. We need to continue to focus on debating the ways to achieve these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament and the Commission have made a major contribution together through the Plan D strategy. If the reflection period is over, that does not mean that we should scale down our efforts to engage civil society and citizens in a debate about the future of Europe. It will be of crucial importance in the European Council, in an intergovernmental conference and in the ratification phase to show that a settlement is of real, direct benefit to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was happy to hear that most Member States are clearly in agreement with the Presidency’s approach for a short intergovernmental conference with a clear and precise mandate to negotiate a rather limited list of issues. As for the Commission, we will be vigorously pursuing our role as the voice of the common European interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">The road to a Treaty settlement has not always been easy, but we are hopefully back on track. If we can hold our nerve and stay focused on the needs of an effective and democratic Europe, the result will give us a European Union that can face the challenges of the 21st century with confidence.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Madam Vice-President of the Commission, you have given us a full presentation of the items on the agenda of the European Council and we thank you.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement on the institutions is needed on 22 June; an agreement that enables Europe to do as the Presidency and the Commission have said and take the decision to act in the areas in which the Union is required: climate, energy, immigration, security and foreign affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of globalisation, our countries, our fellow citizens, must be actors and not spectators. If action is what drives us, if we, as Europeans, are the heirs of a civilisation and the vehicle for values and ideals designed to influence this changing world, we must provide ourselves with the resources for this. We are awaiting a comprehensive agreement on 22 June on the general outlines of a new European treaty enabling the Union to be at once more effective, more democratic, more understandable and, above all, more transparent. Whether it is called a treaty, a simplified treaty or a basic treaty, it must be ratified before the next elections in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want a treaty that lives up to the expectations of the countries that ratified the current treaty, of those who rejected it and of those who reserved judgment. As far as the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are concerned, it can be neither a minimum treaty nor a treaty by default. We need an ambitious, realistic treaty, a treaty that is equal to what is at stake, one that respects the imperatives of subsidiarity and proportionality. This treaty must accord full importance to the parliamentary dimension of European integration. This treaty must endow the European Union with a legal personality, provide for the unification of the rules of the three pillars and settle the issue of a stable presidency of the Council and the issue of the EU’s foreign affairs minister. This treaty must extend the scope of majority voting so that the Union is not paralysed by the right of veto: reservations must not hinder those who, together, want to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This treaty must make the Charter of Fundamental Rights – the common basis of the rights and freedoms of the citizens – legally binding. It must also provide Europe with the legal instruments necessary to rise to the new challenges. It is on all of these fundamentals, on which the demands of our countries and of our fellow citizens converge, that the agreement of 22 June must focus. My group would like to pay tribute to Chancellor Merkel and to Minister Steinmeier for their efforts to make progress on this reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, democracy in a State subject to the rule of law hinges on parliamentary representation. If the Heads of State or Government decide to set up an intergovernmental conference, we expect the parliamentary dimension to be a very strong component of it. I am thinking of a European Parliament that will be represented by eminent and qualified figures, but I am also thinking of the national parliaments, which must make their voices clearly heard in this process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament will, during the course of this part-session, express a position that is both strong and detailed by adopting the Brok/Barón Crespo report on the interinstitutional development of Europe. Our President will communicate this position during the Council of 21 and 22 June. I have no doubt that a great deal of attention will be paid to this position and that it will be reflected in the conclusions of the forthcoming Summit and Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has a duty to produce results. We are confident that, just as it has done previously for climate change and energy, on 22 June the German Presidency will enable the political will to prevail over scepticism, that it will be able to move Europe forward on a matter that is technical, admittedly, but crucial, so that we can decide on the real issues at stake and on the real values.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing to add to the descriptions given by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, for the cards are on the table and we have no need to repeat what we all know already, namely that what will be at stake on 21 and 22 June will be nothing more and nothing less than the future of the European Union as it at present exists, and when I say that, I am not excluding the possibility of that which will exist after 22 June being a different EU – a changed one, a weaker one, or a strengthened one perhaps.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we want is a stronger EU, but, if the EU is to be made stronger, one fundamental presupposition is that we think back to one simple saying: in unity, strength. In fragmentation, weakness. That has been the experience of the European Union over recent years. It is always weak when it is disunited and at odds with itself. It is strong when it is united. Yet the European Union must be strong, for the challenges it faces are enormous, and to all those who dream of vetoes and believe that one would make them strong, one has to say that the filth borne in the air takes no heed of vetoes, nor does it pay any attention to borders. Europe is needed to help save humanity in every area of its activity, and it needs to help in ways only it can.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe still thinks of itself as a large continent, yet, set against the 1.3 billion Chinese and the 1.1 billion Indians – who together, at 2.4 billion, make up a third of the world’s population – the 27 Member States, with their 495 million inhabitants, make up a small one. Even the Federal Republic of Germany, which you, Mr Steinmeier, represent, would, despite its 82 million inhabitants and their enormous economic clout, be a weak country on its own without the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe needs this unity, and the components for it are to hand. We have the challenge of climate change to face. Even if it is from the United States of America that the call to unity comes – and even if we always have to ask what they actually want when they issue such a call – our relationship across the Atlantic demands of us that we do them a favour and unite, for they know that it is only by combining the enormous scientific, economic, cultural and social power that we, on both sides of the Atlantic, can accumulate, that we can make an effective contribution to resolving the world’s problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cards are on the table; the much-praised Mrs Merkel has certainly done a good job and will have yet more hard work to put in. After all, she is a physicist, and physicists know that the most marvellous things can be put together from the most disparate elements; they also know that nothing can succeed unless they do the maths. According to the logic of mathematics, two minuses equal a plus, so there is still hope for the twins in Warsaw.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know where the problems are, Mr President-in-Office. True to your diplomatic undertakings, you have told us that you cannot tell us everything that you know, and a good thing too, for if you did, the vast number of problems you have to deal with would make the mood in the House this morning a less than happy one.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our task is a different one: we have to address an appeal to the governments who are meeting together on 21 and 22 June. Nice was an exercise in failure not only because this or that Head of Government nodded off in the course of the evening, but also because, the following morning, the curse of the evil deed became apparent when everyone said that the treaty would not be enough for 15 Member States and wondered how it could possibly be sufficient for 27; that was why we ended up with the Constitution. Now that itself has not been ratified, but we are 27 Member States in number, and we cannot die for Nice. If we cannot achieve better results than we did with Nice, we have to fall back on it, and then – Mr Saryusz-Wolski please note – Nice will be the death of the European Union. I do not want that, and so we have work out something that brings unity. We in this House have outlined what we think about the Barón Crespo/Brok report, and I have to say – speaking on behalf of my group – that Parliament will make that report its benchmark; offer less than what that report describes as being necessary, and there can be no agreement. My group, at any rate will not vote to accept any result that you offer us that falls short of what has been demanded, and I want to make that quite plain to the Council today. Be optimistic, Mr President-in-Office, and we will be right alongside you; keep fighting to the last minute. It is intolerable that we should end up with failure, with 26 Member States left empty-handed through the refusal of one to play ball. Unity is strength; division brings weakness.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="2155" name="Graham Watson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, one thing we all know. Those of us here and those protesting at Heiligendamm. The key challenges facing our people; challenges like climate change, energy security and international crime remain unsolved because our institutions of government are no longer fit for purpose.</p>
      <p sl="de">Member States recognised this when they signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution, and yet some now backtrack on those commitments without even attempting ratification.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such an approach is contrary to the spirit of European Union, contrary to common sense, contrary to the interests of Europe’s citizens. As Javier Solana said last month, ‘just when we should be at our most alert, just when the world’s demand for Europe is at its highest, the Union has turned inwards, immersed in a state of institutional crisis’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Acting together, Europe could make a real difference where individual Member States meet only a brick wall. The detention of the Bulgarian nurses is a case in point. As a result of January’s Council, diplomatic pressure from all European Capitals has been brought to bear that could soon bring the nurses’ captivity to an end. We call on the Presidency of this House to demand that the Summit unite in the same manner in support of Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist held in Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="de">And yet on wider issues, matters of crucial importance? Well, as Mark Twain reminded us, when all is said and done much more has been said than done!</p>
      <p sl="de">How can we protect our citizens from abuse of data? How can we ensure energy security? How can we manage migration policy if we fail to equip ourselves with the tools for the job? Are the naysayers serious in saying they will sacrifice good governance for the sake of flags and titles? Can they really defend a system of national vetoes which, as President-in-Office Steinmeier pointed out, castrates key initiatives? Codecision and qualified majority voting must be the norm, not the exception, in European policymaking.</p>
      <p sl="de">June’s European Council is an opportunity to close a barren chapter of non-cooperation and start afresh with a toolkit equipped for the times. This House stands firm in its desire to secure a roadmap for reform that can enter into force by the next European elections. We demand robust Parliamentary participation in the IGC, at which we demand greater and more pluralistic representation.</p>
      <p sl="de">As one of the co-authors of the Constitutional Treaty at the European Convention, this House expects to be treated as such, not consigned to the margins as we were for previous Treaties. If the text is to surmount the perceived lack of legitimacy of the original, then the people’s representatives must be given a voice. That voice will argue against a de minimis compromise on the substance of the text. It will insist that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is too important to be downgraded in the manner proposed by the UK, because that way lies differential membership, differential citizenship, differential rights which have no place in a Europe of equals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Chancellor Merkel and Minister Steinmeier for their tremendous efforts so far in trying to find common ground and areas of agreement between what are very disparate ideas as regards the future of Europe. In saying that, he did not want to tell us everything that he knows or everything that he has experienced over the last number of months of these negotiations and discussions. It is also quite amazing and shocking that there is a failure to take movements on core principles and issues of the Berlin Declaration that was agreed by all Member States and approved by this Parliament. We already have agreements on that where we can act together.</p>
      <p sl="en">We spoke eloquently yesterday in this Parliament about the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War and all the things that we could be doing and should be doing if only we had a Constitution. We do not need the Constitution to take immediate action to solve the humanitarian crisis for the people of Palestine. That can be done simply by agreement and by decision. We have already made some moves towards that. There are other areas in which we can move forward, so this idea that has been put forward that without this final agreement we will suddenly fall into a state of paralysis, is incorrect. Mechanisms will be found to overcome the problems and the difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">In saying that, I believe we should have a new Constitution. I believe we should have a new Treaty that clearly sets out the roles and defines the powers of the European institutions. I believe that the rights of the citizen should be protected within that Constitution or within that Treaty. I believe that the ongoing goals and ideals of the European Union should be clearly expressed within that Constitution, that it should stand for democracy, freedom and the rights of peoples; that it should ensure that the rights of Member States are not undermined and to ensure that the voice of the peoples through their elected representatives is allowed an equal voice with other institutions within other organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also believe that there is an onus on us when we speak about what the people want to see us doing. The people do not want to see us taking on new initiatives that we do not have the power to do at the present time. In fact I was quite shocked that the President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council made such a bombastic and ballistic attack on a single country when he was supposed to be acting in a neutral position. Mr Steinbrück wrongly made an attack on Ireland and wrongly made an attack with regard to the arrangements that were put in place and agreed by the Member States and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when we look to the future of the European Union, the future that we must deliver to our children and our grandchildren must be better than what our grandparents gave to us, and they gave it to us out of the ashes of the Second World War. Look at the beautiful child that they created. Let us make that child an adult fit for the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the events surrounding the G8 and its probable failure – which I myself will certainly not cry over – urge us to look to the European Council as at an important time for the European Union, in which consistency and ambition must go hand in hand, not least because the President of this Parliament has accepted that this process should be intergovernmental only. I am very concerned that we will soon witness a repeat of the nights of Nice and I regret that this Parliament has proved unable to fight harder for a more significant role in the current process.</p>
      <p sl="it">The key issue for us is not to bow to the temptation to remain on the defensive and wait to see what the opposition says, then come to a nice little agreement with them. This attitude is mistaken and in the past has meant that we have had to adapt to compromises for which we are paying the price today.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that it would be much wiser to go on the offensive and to join with the 18 countries that want a European Constitution. For example, you have spoken of the issue of climate change; however, I understand from various meetings and conversations that the proposed action is in fact little more than a cosmetic change. Why? When you were Commissioner for the Environment, Mrs Wallström, you put forward an intelligent and promising proposal for a protocol on sustainability. Let us consider it again seriously and ensure that, with this text, the debate on climate change translates into greater powers and more money for the European Union, instead of deceiving citizens on this issue with superficial idle talk.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have many ideas on how to improve the constitutional text: the question of minimum social standards, the issue of taxes, eliminating the right of veto on foreign policy, and improving the review process by removing the veto. I believe that we must be offensive and not merely defensive in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another aspect concerns our institution itself: I firmly believe, as does my group, that within the Intergovernmental Conference debate we must revive the issue of European lists. European lists are a way to become more European. This was a point we lost by just a few votes a couple of years ago. However, in preparation for the 2009 European elections, we must return to discussing how to build a real Europe and how citizens can truly vote for a powerful, influential Parliament. For this reason, Madam President, my group and I are by no means content with the idea of having three or four mere observers at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must have much more than this. We must ensure that there is open dialogue with the Council on the basis of the agreements made in such a way that, as the elected representatives of the European people, we too can have the power to say what we think, because it is through us that citizens can also have their say.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council quoted the German Council Presidency’s slogan about Europe succeeding together, but I now find myself wondering: together with whom? The primary objective was to draw up a roadmap for the further progress of the constitutional process; since we debated the substance of this yesterday, and my group rejected it, I can save myself the bother of talking about it now, but if one compares what has been said over the last few months about strategy – with some wanting to leave the text as it is despite its having been rejected by two countries, some wanting a bit more and others a bit less, some wanting it more about the internal market and others more about social Europe – people are not singing from the same hymn sheet, and so far they have been missing the mark.</p>
      <p sl="de">A lot has been said recently about solidarity in the ‘Europaforum’ broadcast on WDR, about solidarity as the principle on which the European Union is founded and on which basis it should continue to develop, and quite right too, but the only trouble is that the Council’s policy does not tally with that, for it has continued the trend sketched out by the Lisbon Strategy, with more and more areas of life being defined in economic terms and required to be restructured in line with an open market economy with free competition, and the application of criteria derived from management rather than from economics. Examples of this include the liberalisation of postal services, the Services Directive, the Health Directive and the Green Paper on labour law. Whilst politicians are tending more and more to deny themselves the chance to exercise influence over the course of events, your Presidency of the Council is pushing ahead with Europe-wide regulations that I regard as assaults on citizens and on their human rights, two examples of which are: the storage of air passengers’ personal data and the widespread introduction of the collection of biometric data for the purpose of the visa information system in the continuing absence of a single European system for data protection, and this is now being extended into the realm of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">More has been done over recent months to implement the ‘Global Europe’ strategy for a competitive Europe, which is primarily concerned with market access for European businesses, rather than with fair trade, and there are more examples of that, such as the pressure for the tightening up of patent law, free trade agreements rather than cooperation agreements, economic partnerships instead of development aid, all at the same time as Mode 4 of GATS is being categorically nullified, thus affecting workers’ freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I have to say about the G8 Summit is that it might well be legitimate for Heads of Government to get together privately for a barbeque and debate the future of the European Union and other weighty matters, but the goals being negotiated there by individual major EU Member States on the one hand and other economic forces on the other are being laid down in such a way that it would appear that they have to be put into effect on a worldwide scale, yet not even the 27 Member States of the European Union agree among themselves in this way. The decisions taken there are legitimised by nothing; hence, then, the audible and justified protest, to which attention must therefore be given, although I want to make it perfectly clear that we disassociate ourselves from all violence committed by whatever side.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the Presidency and my two esteemed fellow Members, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, would have us ignore the French and Dutch voters. They voted incorrectly, so they must not vote again. The Presidency, the rapporteurs and the large majority of Parliament want the whole of the rejected Constitution brought into effect, only under a new name and without a referendum. Sarkozy’s mini-treaty does not mean fewer obligations. ‘Mini’ refers to the form of decision-making, with minimal influence for the voters and no more referendums. The German Chancellor has led the way. She requires all the countries to accept the content of a Constitution that even her own country has not ratified. In both Slovakia and Germany, constitutional litigation awaits.</p>
      <p sl="da">The former President of the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, former German President and, in addition, Chairman of our Fundamental Rights Convention, Roman Herzog, has indicated that 84% of German laws now come from Brussels and that it is now already doubtful whether Germany can be called a parliamentary democracy. With 59 new areas in which the national parliaments have no right of veto, the EU countries will no longer be parliamentary democracies. It is, then, no longer questionable, but indisputable, that legislation devised by officials and lobbyists has supplanted the form of government we used to call parliamentary democracy. There is one comfort. There are still only 16 of 27 countries, representing 37% of the EU countries’ voters, that have ratified the Constitution within the unanimously adopted two-year deadline. On an entirely formal basis, the Constitution is therefore dead. Let us set up a new, directly elected Convention to prepare a text that can be adopted on the grounds that it will provide living national democracies with transparency, proximity to the people and greater democracy in those areas in which we decide to legislate in common. Let us also hold referendums throughout the EU and so give voters the last word.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the British Government’s White Paper on the original Constitution said that it involved no fundamental change, but why have a Constitution if you do not want fundamental change? What other purpose could there be? Now we have Angela Merkel saying that the new version should have a new name, but ‘use different terminology without changing the legal substance’. How reassuring to be so vividly reminded of German commitment to democracy and the rule of law!</p>
      <p sl="it">The old and, no doubt, the new Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States and between the governed and the governing. Whenever before, I ask you, did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new Constitution on them, except after defeat in war? In my country, the State draws power from the people and it answers to them. The EU plans now that the State seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it. Our rights and freedoms are our birthright. They are not in the gift or at the discretion of a passing parade of political nonentities, here today and gone tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="it">The original draft of the Constitution did us a great service. It crystallised the future. It attempted to turn a Europe of nations into a nation called Europe. It forced us to decide if we should allow Europeans to become our masters. We do not. You are our neighbours. You should be our friends, but nothing more.</p>
      <p sl="it">Whatever its new name, like the last one, this one will not be a Constitution in any real meaning at all. The first was vague, grandiose, imprecise, complex, confusing and extremely long. But more important than any of that, it was proscriptive rather than enabling. It made law rather than seeking to create a framework for lawmaking. It offered no effective checks and balances to control future lawmakers, nor a mechanism to stop the train. It consolidated power for a system of government by a self-perpetuating bureaucracy and it turned the Member States from theoretical masters of the House of Brussels into its servants. What is different this time? This Constitution is not the answer. It is a 1950s solution to 2000s problems and today we live in a very different world. No wonder there is hostility across all 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the Union does not appear, in its day-to-day running, to have been plunged into crisis by the failure to adopt the EU Constitution. According to studies, the Union’s functioning has not been impeded following the 2004 enlargement. On the contrary, the legislative process has in fact gathered pace. Let us not talk about the speed of the process of adopting documents, however, but about the quality of those documents.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The new Treaty must guarantee a level playing field for all Member States, regardless of their size and how long they have been in the Union. It must not, under any circumstances, distort still further the weighting of decision-making and voting. The Union’s democratic legitimacy must be based on the principle of equal representation for citizens and for Member States. The decision-making and lawmaking processes must be transparent and the governments and parliaments of the Member States must be in a position to monitor those processes. The subsidiarity principle must be strengthened and attempts must not be made to ride roughshod over it, as often happens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be stressed too emphatically that this summit will determine whether the European Union possesses the political capacity and the conjoined strength to adapt the fundamentals of the treaties, which now apply to 27 Member States, to the growing demands of a globalised world, or whether it will fail to meet this challenge and keep on energetically running on the spot. The Barón Crespo/Brok report testifies to efforts to get the timetable for the adoption of the Treaty itself adopted, and this House firmly endorses these. Those few Member States whose consent is at present still a cause of contention should therefore perhaps consider whether they are jeopardising the consolidation of the Community, and doing it for the sake of very obvious and selfish interests. Europe must not allow itself to sink into this sort of small-minded swamp.</p>
      <p sl="de">All this having been said, it should still be borne in mind that the consent of all Heads of State or Government is required only primarily rather than exclusively, so let us remind ourselves that it was not they who brought the Constitutional Treaty down, but the members of the public who said no. Whether we will gain their approval by rescuing the Treaty from the dangerous corner of the referendum without examining the reasons for their rejection of it, I venture to doubt.</p>
      <p sl="de">The way my own country is constituted leads me to object to referendums, but I am very definitely in favour of addressing the profound and continuing disquiet about the European Union and getting to grips with it in a pro-active way; for that too, the summit must send out a signal, and to do so is not to square the circle, for dissatisfaction makes itself felt in very definite ways, with reference, for example, to the lack of boundaries both within and without. There must be limits to Europe internally, in its dealings with the Member States; in the internal market, at any rate, we are coming up against the limits of integration, by which I mean the limits of what the public are prepared to accept by way of European rules and regulations, and the Commission is not least among those who transgress those boundaries to integration, occasionally deliberately and without any feel for subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need the structure of a new Treaty. Those who bar the way to this revision of the Treaties out of self-interest and small-mindedness lay themselves open to the question as to whether they really belong in this Community, and we will not fight shy of asking them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, not the least of the things that the Constitution is supposed to do is to establish a basis on which we are better able to organise a common foreign and security policy, but it is no more than a precondition for this and not something without which it cannot happen, nor can we wait until the Constitution is in place before taking certain steps.</p>
      <p sl="de">Knowing as I do, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your own very deep personal commitment, I would ask you, despite your other duties, to do something more for the Middle East over the coming weeks. Yesterday’s debate was under the heading of ‘40 years on’; 40 years on, we are still not yet giving sufficient support to those forces on both sides, among, that is, the Israelis as well as the Palestinians or Arabs, who are campaigning for peace.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the past few days, I have been reading a number of commentaries by Israelis such as Dan Diener, Tom Segev, Meir Shalev and Yaël Dayan, all of whom are forthright advocates of the ‘land for peace’ approach, to which the Palestinians have now committed themselves, as also – under the Saudi plan – have the Arabs. It follows, then, that the European Union must, by the policy it pursues, make unambiguously clear its support for all those forces – including the present Palestinian Government – that stand by these principles and really do want to take the battle to extremism and terrorism. We must do away with the artificial division that consists in talking to some and not to others.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a coalition government in Israel and a coalition government in Palestine, both of which need our support if the conditions for the peace process are to be created, and so, Mr President-in-Office, I ask you – not least because I know how much you are committed to this – to lend your support, in the last days of your Presidency of the Council, to all those forces that are willing and able to resist violence and make a peace process possible. Were it to do this, your presidency would not only be working for a Constitution, but also creating the conditions for a common foreign and security policy to be started in the Middle East.</p>

The problem is that in trying to simplify we end up by being simplistic, and in seeking to define an amending Treaty – rather than a consolidating Treaty – we are in the realm purely of semantics.

      <p sl="pl">Constitutional fanaticism is not a good way out of this crisis. Sound progress towards treaty reform will be made if the forthcoming European Union summit adopts a broad flexible negotiating mandate on the division of competences, the principles of external representation, constitutional symbols and the voting system in Council.

Good objectives of the kind repeatedly held out by the Council Presidency can in fact endure the gaze of the public, so why, if we have such good things planned, do we keep on preventing them from being involved on a long-term basis, when it is long overdue that they should be? By the next summit at the latest it must be made plain just how this consistent exclusion of the public from the constitutional process is to be brought to an end.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also want to say something about a specific policy area, namely climate policy, which is currently being discussed in Europe primarily in association with the G8 Summit, and the June summit on which can only, in my eyes, be considered a success if what is done internationally does not fall short of what was agreed on Europe’s behalf in March. The goal of a two-degree rise in temperature, the acknowledgement of the need to achieve a global 30% reduction in CO2, and that the UN is the body best suited to mutual consultation on the subject are, to my mind, fundamental preconditions. If George Bush, in Heiligendamm, prevents, among other things, that sort of accommodation, I think the European Heads of State who are going to be there would be wrong to expect anything of it; I see the results from the March summit as being worth a good deal more and believe that they should be enforced, for George Bush, the President of the United States, will shortly be yesterday’s man.</p>

As far as we are concerned, priority should be given to economic and social progress, and to the rights of the workers and the people.

She shares with my party leader, David Cameron, a firm commitment to tackling one of the gravest challenges facing mankind today. It is in relation to that kind of hard policy that we all feel that there is a massive urgency and priority and that we can work together in the right way. We can act together in a way which actually enhances the EU in the minds of the people rather than making them suspicious of its intentions for their future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this House is prepared to agree to a revision of the Constitutional Treaty, but only – and I say this for the benefit of the President-in-Office of the Council – if the political content is right. The strenuous efforts to use semantics as a means of assuaging national sensibilities can be accepted for as long as the EU, as a whole, becomes more effective, and what that means is more decisions by qualified majority, including in foreign policy. President Sarkozy is pushing for a mini-Treaty; like a mini-skirt, a mini-Treaty would cover up the essentials.</p>
      <p sl="de">What the people of Europe want is clear proportions, not diplomats in darkened rooms haggling over lawyers’ devious arguments about square roots. Whether or not the Treaty includes references to the European flag or the European anthem is not a matter of life or death. The flag with the ring of stars will continue to flutter in the wind, and the ode to European joy will not cease to resound. As for the foreign minister not being allowed to be called a foreign minister, that, though, is fraudulent labelling. If Mr Solana’s successor can only act after a unanimous decision by the foreign ministers, one might as well call him a postman.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the point of a permanent President of the European Council if a single Polish twin can put a stop to negotiations – with Russia, for example – that are needed. The people – even many of those in the ‘no’ camp – do not want less Europe, but rather a Europe that cares about their problems, and that means that there must be binding fundamental rights for every citizen, with, above all else, the fundamental social rights being secured and extended. The new Treaty must make provision for all proposals emanating from the Commission to be accompanied by a social impact assessment. Public services must also be put on a secure legal footing. Although I am backing the Presidency of the Council, I will not be party to a sell-out, and in that I will certainly not be alone.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, at the next summit the EU will be focusing on how to strengthen itself internally. The new, more compact Treaty will hopefully allow the EU to improve its capacity for making decisions and the EU will in future be able to concentrate on key, concrete issues. One of the most important of these will be fighting climate change and environmental matters.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland agreed at the summit in Helsinki last November on a Northern Dimension policy. Environmental issues have in particular proven to be a success. An example of this is St Petersburg’s Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>
      <p sl="fi">These environmental matters cannot, however, be left at the stage they have reached and this is not the time to stop; on the contrary, now is the time to move on fast. It is specifically in the north that the consequences of climate change are visible most dramatically, for it is there that nature is very delicate, and we have to protect the living conditions of the aboriginal peoples there. For that reason I do hope that under Germany’s leadership the additional financing for the Environmental Partnership Fund is guaranteed, and in so doing a more important role will be given to climate change and environmental issues in Northern Dimension policy and in the control of climate change.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, efforts have been made over the last two years within the European Union to find a sensible way out of the crisis situation that arose after the Constitutional Treaty was rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands. Several ways of simplifying the operation of the Union’s ossified structures have been suggested during the so-called period of reflection. It actually seems that all that time has been wasted, because the only proposals made amount to slimming down the old treaty whilst retaining the majority of its key provisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The intention is to present the slimmed down text to the countries who have already ratified the first treaty as if it were essentially an unchanged version of the original document. It will, however, be presented to the other countries as something completely new, a compromise document. Such action goes far beyond the usual manipulation of the nations of Europe. In addition, it is even planned to deny the nations the opportunity of making their views known through referenda. I believe we should strongly oppose all of this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is expected that at the coming Brussels European Council the decision will be taken to begin work on a new Union treaty based on the European Constitution rejected two years ago. One could be forgiven for feeling that it has long since been decided not only that the nations of Europe need a common constitution but also what form the constitution should take. The national referenda in two European Union Member States demonstrated, however, that the draft constitution for the Union is highly controversial.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I trust that at the June summit in Brussels there will be no unanimity on convening an intergovernmental conference to adopt a new Union treaty. I also hope that the Polish Government’s representatives will block further moves towards a European super state. We would do better to work on guaranteeing the rights of nations in the contemporary world instead of working on a common constitution, whatever name is given to it, and strengthening the Union’s authority at the expense of national sovereignty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we hope this summit will be successful, otherwise we, the leaders of Europe, will be labelled incompetent. We will have demonstrated that we are unable to bring the Union out of crisis and give it a new impetus, which is actually what most Europeans hope for. Despite what other Polish MEPs have said earlier, it is what Poles hope for as well. Seventy-three percent of my countrymen are satisfied with Poland’s membership of the European Union and support the process of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We therefore want a more integrated Union, a deepened Union, and we want a Union that is more Community-minded and less marked by national egotism. This means greater competence for the Union, enhancing the Community method and strengthening Community institutions. In short, what it means is more Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, we want a fairer Union. We want a Union where each citizen’s view carries equal weight regardless of whether that citizen comes from a large, small or medium-sized country. We also hope that the so-called square root system proposed by Poland will be adopted when it comes to laying down a new decision-making method for the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, we want a Union imbued with solidarity, one that remains true to its historical roots. After all, the principle of solidarity underpinned the whole process of European integration. Nowadays that solidarity is expressed by way of political solidarity whenever the interests of any one of the Member States are threatened, on the principle of all for one and one for all. Solidarity also means economic solidarity, which involves supporting the weaker regions in the framework of cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, we want an effective and efficient Europe, one that can rise to the challenges of globalisation and the threats in the world around us, particularly those that transcend national borders. We want a Union that is able to combat terrorism and organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, whilst all attention today is, of course, focused on the future of the constitutional process, I should like to address a different issue. We are equally impressed by the initiatives which the Presidency has taken, not least with regard to Central Asia. It is good, as I see it, for the European Union to shift its attention to that part of Asia, which is very close to Europe and the EU’s new neighbours. So far, it has been a blank area on our map, and I think it is important to support the Presidency’s initiatives in this area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The developments in that region are of huge importance to the European Union, whether the issue is energy policy or the stability of the countries in question, including in connection with our own presence in Afghanistan. Where that region is going is not quite clear. We are dealing with different countries where different processes are underway. To gain our own impression of the situation there, we travelled with a small delegation of our group to Kazakhstan last week to size up the developments in that region. Upon arrival, you notice that the interest in the European Union over there is considerable and that relations, not least in the economic sphere, between a country such as Kazakhstan and the European Union develop at great speed. The European Union is now by far the most important trading partner of a country such as Kazakhstan. You notice that people over there are keen to work with the European Union, because those countries are wedged in between China and Russia and stand to benefit from a third powerful partner in order to be able to guarantee the balance and independence of the region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is also of interest is to establish that the focus is not just on energy and cooperation. There are options in that area, although we have to tread carefully given the fact that Russia recently landed a number of important deals thanks to fresh agreements with Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In the longer term, however, there is still a great deal of scope, as I see it, for energy cooperation with a country such as Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, what is important in a balanced policy is also, of course, the human rights relationship. The European Union should draw a distinction between countries such as Kazakhstan, where a positive impact is possible, and countries such as Turkmenistan and particularly Uzbekistan, which have regimes which, as we see it, leave little scope for cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to make one final remark. The Russian influence in that region is still very tangible. What I should like to stress at the end of my brief speech is that we must avoid a competitive battle of some sort between Russia and the European Union over Central Asia. We should strive for cooperation in that area too, including in the field of energy. We will need Russia, too, for the development of further energy relations with the Central Asian area. Once again, though, I should like to congratulate the Presidency on this new initiative.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the German Presidency is right to listen to the different opinions that have been expressed in Europe on the Constitution. I do hope, however, that this does not mean it is the saboteurs rather than the pioneers who will determine the pace; that it does not mean our yielding to paralysis rather than opting for progress; that it does not mean our being guided by fear instead of by ambition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have heard some people say that the Constitution was too ambitious. How could it be too ambitious, though, if you consider the challenges we face in the 21st century? Even if we are ambitious, that does not mean that we are working towards achieving a superstate. I would like us to stop using this terminology once and for all. The term ‘superstate’ is utter nonsense.</p>
      <p sl="nl">People talk about a reduced Treaty. Why a reduced Treaty? For a reduced Europe? For a political dwarf? I hope that the German Presidency will try to keep the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty. The fundamental rights are not purely a legal matter; leaving the Charter out of the Treaty also sends a political message, even if the fundamental rights become legally enforceable. I hope that no new paralysing vetoes will be introduced for national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, a comment that is made frequently is that we listen to what the citizens have said, especially in the Netherlands and in France – the Netherlands being my own country. One of the things the Dutch citizens have said is that they have had enough of decisions being taken behind their backs, over their heads and behind closed doors. Is it not rather odd, therefore, that we should opt for an IGC behind closed doors? For confessional box procedures? For bilateral negotiations? I hope that the Presidency will dare take revolutionary action and will dare suggest that the next IGC will be held out in the open.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like first of all to pay tribute to the determination of Mrs Merkel, who has made it possible for the imperative and immediate need for a genuine relaunch of the EU institutions to be included in the Berlin Declaration. I should also like to stress the importance of the contribution made by Nicolas Sarkozy to this debate, because even before he took on the role of President of the French Republic, he was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty, which seems to be the most appropriate scenario for breaking the deadlock that we are in.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament must do everything it can to help the Member States to strengthen Europe’s capacity to take action with institutions that have the resources to meet the requirements of our fellow citizens in terms of effectiveness, democracy and consistency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The idea of a simplified treaty must meet the requirement for a document that is more compact and more accessible than the Constitutional Treaty. This simplification must not, however, under any circumstances be perceived as a renunciation or a stopgap solution. We want a consensus to emerge in favour of an ambitious and realistic solution aimed at rallying together all the Member States: the eighteen that said ‘Yes’, the two that said ‘No’ and all those that have not yet expressed an opinion on the draft European Constitution. Our challenge is not to come up with an ideal treaty, but to reach a compromise among the 27 so that Europe moves forward, as one and pragmatically, with the aim of breaking out of the current deadlock as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that, during the European Council of 21 and 22 June, you will reach an agreement, Minister, with the Heads of State or Government establishing a precise mandate so that a swift intergovernmental conference, under the Portuguese Presidency, will draft a new treaty that will enable the Union to be strengthened and our fellow citizens to have more faith in the future of our continent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am confident and optimistic because everyone, today, is well aware of his or her responsibility to find a way out of the stalemate that has had a negative impact on European integration as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what, in the case of the Summit, would be counted as a success for it, and what as failure? Yesterday, in Brussels, I heard a high-ranking politician say that even a mini-Treaty would be a maxi-success, yet that, of course, is what it cannot be. You are familiar with Parliament’s position, with our unwillingness to accept any reductions in citizens’ rights, in effectiveness, in transparency or in democracy and we do not see why we should accept anything less, for we know from Eurobarometer that the citizens of all 27 Member States want more Europe rather than less.</p>
      <p sl="de">We were very encouraged to hear you say that there was agreement on the essentials. I believe that the Treaty has to become a ‘Treaty plus’. A certain amount has been added to it since 2004, such as, for example, the debate on protection against climate change, and it would be very fine if the protocol that Commissioner Wallström proposed back in the days of Nice, or some similar wording, were now to be incorporated into this Treaty. I also take the view that the public need a declaration on the social nature of Europe. There are great misunderstandings around about the Treaty, as if it were some neo-liberal con-trick; it could have a declaration added to it explaining its benefits and advantages both for the citizen and for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The institutional balance must be maintained. I ask you to take care to attach the same value to the national parliaments while not allowing the Community method to be demolished. The yellow card cannot be turned into a red one; to do so would wreck the Community method and give this House a far less significant role. Moreover, whilst capacity is not dependent on symbols, no convention would ever have had the idea of doing away with them. Even while talking about giving Europe a soul, we are taking away the few visible signs of identification with it, and that is why I believe we have to take up the cudgels for them too. After all, a minority must not be allowed to dictate what the majority may want. I appeal to the German Presidency of the Council to stand firm, for we are behind you and many Member States are alongside you.</p>

Although we know how difficult your task is and how intransigently certain Member States are behaving, we very much hope that you will succeed in getting a mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference, and you have, in any case, our support.</p>
      <p sl="de">We German liberals see three core issues as having priority. Firstly, we do not want the compromise on the institutional issues and the voting procedures to be negotiated all over again. We also see that as involving doing away with the pillar structure, and if you call for that, you knowingly take on board the fact that there will be no successor regulation to Nice before 2009, which, in terms of the single Europe project, is not merely irresponsible, but positively destructive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need a European Foreign Minister and a European External Affairs Service appointed from among the Council, the Commission and the Member States, with the foreign minister not to be an ornament to the EU, but its mouthpiece; someone capable of taking decisions and backed up by the common political will of the capitals when things get tough. In exactly the same way as Mr Leinen, I found what you had to say at the beginning of our debate encouraging.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we would like to see strong protection for fundamental rights – something that is self-evident to Liberals. We know about the problems you are having with the retention of the Charter in the text, but, Mr President-in-Office, we urge you not to relent, for, as you yourself have said, the German Presidency will be judged by what it achieves in taking the Treaty forward, and I can predict that this House will see the debate on a two-speed Europe kick off with a bang if individual Member States refuse to give you a proper mandate, and there will be no stopping things then; the debate will then be one that we did not want, but that arises from objective necessity.</p>

I believe that one of our tasks in the European Council with regard to the Constitutional Treaty is, as Mrs Wallström has said, to produce an accessible, comprehensible and clear document.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is possible to do so. That has been demonstrated by the Action Committee for European Democracy, chaired by Giuliano Amato: 448 articles have been reduced to 71 articles, 67 000 words to 16 800.</p>
      <p sl="es">Brief therefore, but also good, as Gracián suggested. It is good because we are considering the content, and maintaining the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore possible to do so, Mr President. Judging from the tone of the speeches today in this Parliament, I believe that an enormous majority in this House – and the vote on the Barón/Brok report will demonstrate this – wants to maintain the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="es">I believe that it is actually a narrow street, because you are acting in public and, following the Convention, we cannot go back to deciding everything behind closed doors. This is a change that the European Council must take very much into account. Things must be done openly, under the scrutiny of the press and the Internet, and that is a message that I believe not just the Presidency of the Council, but also all of the governments, must bear very much in mind.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, with regard to our proposal, we have not been as concise as the working group chaired by our dear friend Mr Amato. Our proposal is that Parts I and II produced by the Convention should not be touched, and I very much appreciated what you said about respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with a view to producing a simplified Treaty, I would propose adding ‘liberté, egalité et fraternité’ to Europe’s motto of ‘united in diversity’. Why? Because this is a union of sovereign and equal States, and also of citizens; because we are all equal and no State or player can impose their will on the others and fraternity demands that we resolve the problems of others, but not at the expense of bringing the problem to our country.</p>

      <p sl="pl">This summit has to be a success, but the Constitution will not be the only important issue it will have to deal with. At the start of her Presidency, Mrs Merkel indicated that we had to build Europe together. By that standard, it has been a good Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, the principle of solidarity has regained its pre-eminence. It must also be incorporated into the common energy policy and the common emigration policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the principle of the Union’s unity and cohesion vis à vis the outside world has been defended. We cannot be divided and we stand as one on the most important matters. That remains a crucial issue for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, we have reached a turning point as regards the workings of the Union. Many bilateral discussions have taken place, and the fundamental debate on the Union’s future and institutional efficiency has been resumed. I am convinced that it often takes many months or even years for such major political initiatives to be recognised as a success.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be borne in mind too that the Union is in a great technological race to ensure victory for the Lisbon Strategy. Mrs Merkel also said that technology, talent and tolerance are needed for development. The Seventh Framework Programme got off to a good start with many programmes linked to innovation and the new technologies. Questions arise, however, as to how we can retain talent in Europe, and how we can become more competitive. So far the answer has not been forthcoming.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The German Presidency will certainly be associated with specific Lisbon Strategy successes such as the new roaming charges, the opening of the energy market and the opening of the market in services and labour. Credit is also due to the European Commission, however.

      <p sl="fr">I shall take two examples: the symbols and the Charter. We read that the symbols are going to disappear: the anthem, the flag, the motto. This is not good news because the people of France are going to see that the outcome of their vote has resulted in the disappearance of the flag just when the President of the French Republic has put it on his official portrait. The symbol counts. It is a feeling of belonging. Try at the very least to keep the flag.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motto that the German Presidency of the Council is ‘Europe – succeeding together’, and the new Treaty has been drafted in a transparent manner by the personal representatives of the Heads of State or Government, of all the national parliaments and by the EU institutions. Since this January, here in this House, the President of the Council said that there must, in Europe, be no tolerance for intolerance, our intention, at the Council, should be to say that there must be no tolerance for ignorance, be it for ignorance of one’s own signature, ignorance of what it means to be a community of peace, freedom, democracy and solidarity, or ignorance of the work of the members of the Convention and ignorance of the common political goals of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those who seek to weaken the European Union rather than to make it more transparent, closer to its citizens, more democratic and better fitted to act are weakening every Member State and every European citizen. I see the ‘Europe – succeeding together’ slogan as a firm renunciation of à la carte Europe, of two-speed Europe, of the so-called third chamber. Let me tell you why: the European Union can succeed only if it carries on down the way of mutual consideration, of action in solidarity and does not become a community of cherry-pickers. Those who divide the whole weaken it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The national parliaments will be strengthened by the subsidiarity proviso; participation in European law cannot do that for them.

All Europeans, including Poland and its people, have an important contribution to make to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that a political understanding on the European treaty should be reached at the June European Council. As far as possible, such a treaty should be based on the Constitutional Treaty signed by all Member States of the European Union in 2004. Despite being simplified, the new Treaty should retain all the major innovations of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The intergovernmental conference ought to be convened immediately after the forthcoming summit, so that the final document can be ready by the end of this year. It could then be officially signed early next year and ratified prior to the European Parliament elections due in June 2009. For this to be possible the voting system enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty based on a double majority of countries and citizens must be retained. This is essential for the European Union’s activities to be accepted by society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Government’s stance is aimed at amending the voting system and represents a return to the notion of wheeling and dealing within the Union. The effect would be precisely the opposite of what is intended. I would like to state my very serious concern about the equivocal position adopted by the Polish Government at the current negotiations. Poland’s stance is entirely incomprehensible to national public opinion and to its European partners. I therefore call on the Polish Government to support a compromise on the European treaty.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of its term there is no doubt that the German Presidency bears a considerable responsibility, as we all entrust ourselves to its leadership to bring us finally to a positive solution to the issue of the European constitution.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament is firmly committed to supporting Europe in becoming a key player in politics. We are well aware that we must reach a compromise; we understand that not all the work of the Convention and not all of the text of the Treaty approved by so many countries can enter into force.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are some issues, however, on which Parliament cannot back down: I refer to questions such as majority voting, legal personality, foreign policy, and the flag and anthem.</p>
      <p sl="it">There will be much to discuss and Parliament must play a key role. We therefore formally request, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament, through its President and its representatives, be allowed to actively participate in the Intergovernmental Conference, in short, to act as a genuine contributor together with governments and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">I feel I must say again that we must never forget our identity, we must never forget our Judaeo-Christian roots. Finally, I would like to tackle an issue that concerns the next Council: the problem of immigration. In Europe, and I say this as a representative from the southern border of the European Union – my country, Italy, has 7 000 kilometres of coastline – we are experiencing serious crises every day, in Malta, in Spain, in France. We call on the European Union to make a serious commitment, by developing the Frontex project and strengthening all initiatives that will enable us to curb illegal immigration into the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I rise to speak further to Rules 9 and 146 of our Rules of Procedure, the latter of which governs the steps the President may take to enforce discipline, while Rule 9(2) governs the conduct and dignity of this House’s Members and their respectful behaviour in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="de">Earlier on, our President, Mr Poettering, said in response to a speech by Mr Helmer that he was not in a position to do anything about it if Members offended against the dignity of this House. I take a different view. It is quite clear from Rule 9(2) that Members are required to maintain dignity and treat one another with respect, and that the President possesses the power to intervene and call them to order under Rule 146.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why am I making this point? I do so because Mr Helmer, in his speech, called the President of the Council, Mrs Merkel, a liar, and I regard that as unacceptable.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Members of this House are supposed to respect not only one another but also the representatives of other institutions. If I were to describe Mr Helmer as a confused person – which I am not doing, but I ask you to imagine me doing so – then that would be derogatory to his dignity and an offence against mutual respect. That is why I do not do it. In exactly the same way, though, one can insist on a Member not being allowed to make such an outrageous statement in this House with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore ask the Bureau to consider what disciplinary measures might be taken.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, when our colleague, Mr Helmer, said that Mrs Merkel had lied, he attributed this to something very specific: a written directive in which she recommends keeping the substance of the Constitutional Treaty by amending the terms in such a way as to deceive the public. Our colleague, Mr Helmer, therefore simply made legitimate use of his right of criticism, albeit sharp criticism. I condemn the outright totalitarian approach – but it does not surprise me from our fellow Member, Mr Schulz – that results in all unsuitable opinions being clamped down on.</p>

Rule 9(2) is clear: Members’ conduct shall be characterised by mutual respect. The Rule does not provide any more details. It therefore falls to the Presidency to assess whether or not a comment is offensive. Mr Schulz, at the time when the incident you have mentioned took place, I personally was not in the chair, so please appreciate that I cannot get involved in judging the way the President of Parliament acted. In any event, you must all be aware that, according to our Rules of Procedure, no expression may be used in this House that is insulting, injurious or offensive to another Member.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, having myself had a guest’s seat at this debate on a point of order, I must now presume on you to come back to the debate we were having beforehand, which had to do with the forthcoming Council. I would like to begin with a parallel that has frequently been drawn in this debate, that between the G8 Summit, which is currently going on in Heiligendamm, and the next European Council. There are, indeed, overlapping themes, and I shall address my remarks directly to Mr Markov, who has set himself up as the representative of all the critics who are currently demonstrating against the G8 summit or otherwise expressing their opposition to it. My personal view is that one either criticises G8 conferences for not being legitimated to take political decisions, or one criticises them for taking decisions that are insufficiently acute, clear and – where climate change is concerned – fall short of what is demanded. I have to tell Mr Markov that you cannot do both at once.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I am not making a party political point when I say that we should all get together and consider very carefully what the political consequences would be if our criticism of political summits were to be unremitting. It is precisely those who have not, so to speak, lost their senses, who know that we, in a world that has become more problematic, need to do politics in dialogue, that should feel least obliged to criticise summit meetings of this kind, and anyone who is critical of the summit in Heiligendamm on the grounds that lively debates are going on there about climate change and because they fear that sort of controversy really has no business taking part in them. Where different interests are at stake, though, simply waiting to see what will happen will not produce the desired result; I would take as an example of this our own European debate on climate change, which went on until March this year, and in which there was no manifest likelihood of our coming up with an agreed outcome by March. The simple fact is that argument is sometimes necessary, and certainly gets things moving in the right direction; I hope that is the result that will emerge from Heiligendamm.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may now turn to the forthcoming European Council and to the work that is going to be done there on the great European reform project, I would like, in the first instance to thank all those who have taken part in the debate for their confidence in the German Presidency of the Council, although I am of course aware that this trust goes hand in hand with high expectations that we will bring about a resolution of the issues still outstanding in connection with the European Council and with the Constitution in the course of the next few weeks. The only promise I can give you is that our ambition to do so is undiminished, and that we will not only invest time in dialogue but will also try to make what we hope will be creative proposals for solutions where such are still needed. There are those who have said, here and today, that there is no alternative to success at the European Summit, and I have to say that I agree with them all.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">There are those who have been critical of what they call a lack of openness to the public, but perhaps we should leave that debate to one side for a moment, for you all know better than I do that nothing is as public as a debate on European lawmaking, and you know that we need a unanimous resolution of the European Council as well as a debate in Parliament. Since there are no indications that one will not be forthcoming, it is in your interest too that we should prepare as well as possible for this council to be a success, and that calls for talks in which we will have to test and amend wordings that we do not yet know will carry weight, rejecting or withdrawing most of them for not yet providing us with a sustainable way to a solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we meet together at the European Council, every proposal will of course be public, and I am very well aware that our Presidency will come in for criticism every time a new wording is proposed. If the Council as a whole endorses the proposals, then it will come in for criticism – as will the Commission to the extent that it has a hand in things. Since openness and criticism will not be in short supply at the Council, we should not, by unnecessary criticism, make the period of necessary work preceding it more burdensome.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do believe that the process over recent weeks has enabled us to reduce the number of outstanding issues to a considerable degree, and that is a good sign.</p>
      <a text="(The President called the Chamber to order.)"/>
      <p sl="de">We now have a more limited and manageable space in which we have to seek a solution, and I hope that you will all help to win over your governments, who, as we all know, still take a rather sceptical view of this big project that we have planned for the end of the German Presidency of the Council. I thank you for this debate. Let us, during the European Council, work together to make it a success and without losing the confidence that all 27 European governments will be sufficiently aware of their shared responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is unthinkable to ask people who are actually paid to talk together to shut up. That is how you make decisions here.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have two final remarks. I should like to remind you of what Mr Watson did in his speech: he brought the spirit of Mark Twain into this Chamber. He quoted Mark Twain, and, for those of you who were not here, Mark Twain said that at the end of the day when all is said and done more has been said than done. We now need to move from words to deeds on an institutional settlement. We feel that we deserve a second chance but cannot afford a second failure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just have two things I would like to send with Mr Steinmeier. I look at the leaders of the political groups and at the Minister in doing so, because we have to realise that we have a joint responsibility to explain and make it clear to people how this method of intergovernmental negotiations will have to be combined with explaining and listening to citizens; how we have a responsibility to communicate about this process with full respect of the fact that this and all its details cannot be negotiated in public. We have a joint responsibility to do as much as possible to involve citizens and civil society and make it an open, transparent and democratic process to the highest level possible. We must work together on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it is time for me to repeat that the Commission’s position on an issue that several of you raised and which concerns the European Parliament’s involvement on this issue is that we see that the European Parliament should be closely associated with the intergovernmental conference, at least matching the involvement that it enjoyed at the last intergovernmental conference. That is our position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we also have to work together to work out the political narrative in communicating with citizens, and that has to do with embracing the issues that concern most citizens. They are worried about migration, climate change and energy, and we have to send the message that we want to equip the European Union and its institutions in the best possible way to meet these new political challenges.</p>

I should like to thank all those MEPs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and all the political groups, whose goodwill enabled this report to be adopted quickly. I should like, too, to thank the Portuguese Government – and in particular Secretary of State José Magalhães – for taking the initiative and putting forward this system whereby new Member States that fulfil the Schengen assessment criteria do not have to remain unjustly suspended and can join the system immediately.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, speaking on behalf of Parliament as its rapporteur, I would like to sound a warning to the Council and the Commission. In our opinion, this transitional measure must never be allowed to hinder the rapid conclusion of SIS II, which must not be delayed and must remain a priority in view of the value-added and important innovation it encompasses for our collective security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Third and lastly, a point of information. I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to exert pressure on the Member States. Each Member State is responsible for getting ready to enter the system and to remove internal borders. Entering the Schengen system means that we have mutual trust when it comes to monitoring our external borders. During this Schengen assessment process there is no place for political agreements between governments to water down criteria and requirements. This is not an exercise in sympathy. This is about our shared security, and the security of Europe’s citizens is not something to be dealt with lightly.</p>

In keeping with the simplification of other legislation, the Commission has taken the opportunity to update and bring together in a single legislative document all of the rules spread across several regulations. The rapporteur has updated these rules with other texts adopted following the Commission’s proposal, as part of the regulation on total allowable catches and quotas for 2007.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The simplification proposal is, in itself, a good thing. We feel, though, that the consequences of some of the measures incorporated for the long distance fleet, for the fisheries sector and by extension for national economies should be pre-empted and managed.</p>

In 2004 the European Commission announced that, due to technical delays, it had to propose a new timetable envisaging an operational SIS II as of 17 December 2008.

      <p sl="pt">It is also an opportunity to reaffirm our opposition to the ideas of extending the scope of the Fund without raising its financial ceiling and of lowering the threshold to mobilise the Fund, in such a way that the EU Member States with the highest GDP stand to gain the most from it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should also like to highlight our proposals, adopted by Parliament, aimed at acknowledging the specific nature of disasters in the Mediterranean region – and adapting the Solidarity Fund to timeframes and eligible actions, and to the specific nature of natural disasters such as drought and fire – and at looking into the possibility of setting up a farming disaster fund.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Apart from the delay in activating this EU financial assistance, the cause of which must be investigated, one of the most striking points is the paltry amount in relation to the estimated losses directly sustained. The overall amount of Community financial aid for these disasters is some EUR 24.4 million to a loss totalling almost EUR 900 – EUR 520 million in the case of Hungary and EUR 372 in the case of Greece.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is another example, in other words, of the discrepancy between the volume of losses and the amount offered by the Community.

The League of Polish Families to which I belong is opposed to the creation of a new European super state and to all measures aimed at depriving nation states of their sovereignty.

      <p sl="sk">() Critics frequently describe the EU as a strong organisation which meddles in too many areas. As an MEP for Slovakia, a new Member State which has only recently acceded to the Union, I feel that we should have a stronger Europe capable of greater action. For this reason I believe it is essential to adopt a revised constitutional document, that is, to have clear rules of the game. The Union needs to reform the founding treaties in a way which would enjoy broad public support.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I appreciate the efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel to lead the Union out of its constitutional crisis by introducing a road map offering appropriate solutions for the problems that the European Union is facing both internally and externally, as well as the problems associated with the expansion and deepening of the EU’s political dimension.</p>
      <p sl="sk">An enlarged EU needs tools and means to operate efficiently, to strengthen its role in the world, and to address the concerns of its citizens against the background of challenges brought about inter alia by globalisation, climate change, the need to ensure energy supply and an ageing population. Many of the issues which provoked some of the greatest concern among the European public, such as the directive on services in the internal market and the financial framework, have since been resolved.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As reiterated in the Berlin Declaration on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, we must build the EU on a renewed joint foundation and we must do so before the 2009 elections for the European Parliament.

Realism is no less virtuous than idealism.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Might it be that this ‘awareness campaign’ is being used, rather like the referendums on the lapsed Constitutional Treaty, as a covert way of using Community money, scandalously, to fund propaganda campaigns to promote the content of the Treaty?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second is the effective guarantee and exercise of multilingualism in the European institutions and, in this case, Parliament. We wish to highlight the fact that the increasing outsourcing of language and translation services, and other types of unstable contract, inevitably affects the quality of the service and undermines the rights of those providing this service.</p>

      <p sl="sv">In the first amendment, Mr Lundgren points out that the travelling circus moving between the three different places of work results in absurdly high costs. With that much I agree. The problem lies with the accusation, which finds its way into the third amendment, that the EU would be going in for questionable property speculation. The opposite is, of course, true: the European Parliament saves money by owning its buildings. Because there were parts of the proposal I agreed with, I abstained from voting in the first case and voted against in the second.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the second amendment, Mr Lundgren expresses the view that the EU should refrain from conducting centralised campaigns. In this matter too, I am in agreement: it is unlikely that Europeans would have a more positive attitude towards the EU as a result of the Commission’s communications strategies. I would have difficulty, however, objecting to the EU choosing to invest resources in providing information about its activities in the run-up to a European Parliament election. It is by working constructively, notably in our own countries between elections, that we are best at providing information at local level. It is when we engage in constructive politics that we are best at communicating policy.</p>
