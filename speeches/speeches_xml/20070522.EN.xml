      <p sl="es">Madam President, I wonder whether the President of this Institution could express his support, if he has not already done so, for the Secretary-General of the United Nations’, Mr Ban Ki-moon’s, call for a cease to hostilities in Lebanon, which are causing huge loss of life.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this is essential and that it would reflect the feelings of every single Member of this Parliament. I know that we have a debate on the situation in Palestine this afternoon, but the truth is that, at this very moment, innocent civilians are still dying in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is what I am asking for.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0149/2007) by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on Global Europe – external aspects of competitiveness (2006/2292(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-016" speaker_id="28219" name="Daniel Caspary" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this European Union of ours, being the biggest single market in the world, carries, globally speaking, particular weight, and, if we are to remain internationally successful, we have to create the right framework conditions at home, while also organising our external trade policy in such a way that takes adequate account of our own economic interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was in October 2006 that the Commission set out its thinking on a trade strategy of this kind, in its communication ‘Global Europe: competing in the world’. This report by the Committee on International Trade is not intended as a riposte to that, but is meant to adjust certain priorities, for the Commission – and you, too, Commissioner – must have the right priorities rather than pursuing short-term results.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everyone gains from the opening up of our trading partners’ markets; the European Union is a very good example of just how successful open markets are, and it is the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, that offers the best machinery currently available for opening them up. The goal of multilateral trade liberalisation within the WTO framework must be that of making great forward strides in the current trade round, despite all the difficulties associated with it; even though the prospects for a successful completion are certainly not the best, we in the European Union should continue to do all in our power to make it a success, for bilateral or regional free trade agreements are no more than the second-best option or even emergency solutions, given the multifarious disadvantages associated with them. If free trade agreements are to be concluded, then certain conditions need to apply: for a start, the choice of free trade agreements needs to be limited to the states or economic regions with which our competitors have already concluded an agreement or are in the process of negotiating one; secondly, the scope of such a free trade agreement should go well beyond the WTO topics, and we in the European Union should also, additionally, endeavour to entrench in this free trade agreement standards agreed plurilaterally on the broadest possible basis. I am thinking, for example, of rules of origin, which are negotiated in different ways in every free trade agreement and are scarcely applicable to our small and medium-sized businesses, more and more of which are seizing the opportunities afforded by globalisation and exporting their products.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, alas, other political goals were prioritised at the cost of trade policy, and so we should, in future, avoid burdening trade policy with irrelevant issues, while, at the same time, taking care that the existing rules, to which we and our trading partners have agreed are actually complied with. This is particularly the case as regards intellectual property, with its many instances of existing law and contractual agreements being no more than inadequately applied or even of their application being actively frustrated. The European Union’s trade protection instruments, the anti-dumping rules in particular, offer protection against unfair trading practices.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to point out that a very broad majority in the Committee on Trade concurred with me that there is at present no need for the revision of the trade protection instruments advocated by the Commission. We should not pre-empt the outcomes of talks within the WTO, however difficult they may at present be; the European Union’s trade protection instruments have, by and large, proved their worth, and are not, at present, in need of any modification.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now that tariffs are being reduced, other forms of obstacles to trade are gaining in importance. For example, anti-terror measures in all economic areas must not become the 21st century’s non-tariff barrier to trade, and regulation, too, plays an important part in this, so we must do more to make our internal rules and regulations compatible with the rules of our main trading partners. It is for that reason in particular that I firmly support cooperation with the United States and the efforts made over recent weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am highly confident that we will be able to make proper use of the opportunities afforded by global markets for our own benefit and for that of other countries, be they in the process of development or already industrialised, provided that the right priorities are set. People in Europe and around the world will feel the positive effects of this, and I am very grateful to the Members, the Committee Secretariat and the staff of the groups for making it possible for us, in the course of the past few weeks, to draw up a report that I believe might well find a broad majority in this House when it comes to the final vote. I extend warm thanks to them for their cooperation, and also to the Commission for taking our suggestions on board.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very important report. Let me recall the background of Global Europe. In Europe we face huge challenges due to the pace of change in the global economy. This creates new opportunities, but it also generates some insecurity and understandable concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our core message is clear: rejection of protectionism at home, activism in opening markets abroad. We need to look beyond tariff reduction, to the trade barriers that lie behind borders. We also need to step up our engagement with the major economies of the next generation, particularly – but not only – in Asia, where there is huge potential for growth but where Europe is not performing as strongly as it should.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first priority remains the WTO and the Doha Development Agenda and I want to say something about that. There is a lot at stake for the global economy and for the developing world, and I will certainly explore every avenue in the weeks ahead to make a deal possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">For two days last week the European Union hosted the Brazilian, Indian and US ministerial negotiators just outside Brussels. We had a constructive meeting, focusing on numbers and outcomes. Achieving these outcomes will not be at all easy. However, I believe on balance that we can find our way through this negotiation and conclude the Doha Round this year, as we agreed in Delhi in April. This requires convergence amongst the G4 in the next month or so. The political commitment to that objective is high indeed at the highest political level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The gaps are still wide between us, both inside agriculture and between agriculture and industry and services. However, they are bridgeable if all parties agree to combine sufficient ambition with sufficient flexibility. I will insist on the basic principle that there should be real cuts and effective reductions from all key players in all key areas. Real market access in agriculture is worth real farm subsidy reductions and real cuts in industrial goods tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The level of ambition of the final package in agriculture and in industrial tariffs is inextricably linked. Europe is prepared to do a lot – indeed more than others – but we are not prepared to go to the limit of our ambition if others do not do the same. Of course there must be proportionate effort between developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also vital to remember that the bulk of the economic gains in the Doha Round will not come from agricultural market access or indeed non-agricultural market access but from commitments by WTO members to open their services markets and from cutting the red tape and costs in time and money affecting trade flows worldwide. The services and trade facilitation negotiations are operating on a different timeline to the market access negotiations, but they must not fall through the gaps.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of us amongst the core negotiators must assume our fair share of the effort and responsibility needed for a balanced outcome in this round. We all need to look forward to the economies we want to create in the future, rather than backwards to defend the structures of the past. Yes, consolidate the gains from past market opening, but also make a contribution to the new market opening needed to boost trade growth in the future. That is the only basis on which these negotiations can conclude, and we have little over a month to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we can and should build on the platform created by the WTO to generate new opportunities for growth by further opening markets bilaterally to trade and investment, not as an alternative but as a complement to the DDA.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have quite an ambitious agenda ahead of us: FTA negotiations with Korea, India and ASEAN, stepping up our engagement with China and the United States, IPR enforcement, a renewed market access strategy, follow-up of the trade defence instruments Green Paper, and further work on the trade and development agenda. We do this against the background of this complex multilateral trade round. This requires careful handling. But the first six months of our Global Europe strategy demonstrate that we can move forward in parallel: we have taken concrete initiatives following our Global Europe agenda and we have put the DDA back on track.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caspary, for his excellent work. I am very happy to see the way the report handles all these issues. I am glad that Parliament takes a high interest in the report, which is clearly demonstrated in the almost 200 amendments. I am also happy to see that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been associated, given the link with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me assure you that we have involved Parliament, and will continue to do so in the future, in the development of the Global Europe agenda. We informed the Committee on International Trade during the preparatory work of our overall communication, which I presented to the Committee on International Trade once it had been adopted by the Commission. My departments or myself have discussed all initiatives following the Global Europe agenda – i.e. the communication on China, the Green Paper on TDI, the communication on market access – at different times with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">For new FTAs, the negotiating directives have been provided to the Committee on International Trade – which is a novelty – and my departments have briefed the committee recently on the state of play. I will update the Committee on International Trade in early June on the FTA negotiations that we have just kicked off.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will consider carefully the recommendations and suggestions made by Parliament in its resolution. However, as guardian of the treaties we will do so by respecting the existing framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need your continued full cooperation and your valid input on Global Europe in order to make the right choices on this ambitious journey. I am very glad that we have made good progress on this today with the Caspary report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-018" speaker_id="28159" name="Benoît Hamon" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Caspary. I am going to confine myself, in one minute’s speaking time, to mentioning the main facts in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is responsible for monetary policy issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took an interest in the issue of the rates of exchange between the euro and the currencies of our main partners and competitors in order to highlight that the benefits expected from a reduction in customs duties on exports, or the market shares that one might hope for from enhanced controls in the area of non-tariff barriers, may clearly be reduced to nothing by an unfavourable change in the exchange rate. That is why we are suggesting that the Commission propose new trade defence instruments that will enable European producers to defend themselves faced with an excessive depreciation in the currencies of our competitors and that we look at the United States, where a number of our fellow legislators in the US Senate have devised a system that hits imports from countries with artificially undervalued currencies with a corresponding customs duty. So, without going that far, we believe that the inertia shown in this area has become incomprehensible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The other issue among the many contributions in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I should like to point out quickly, is the issue of the environment. I believe that it is unfair that European producers, who must meet costs associated with less-polluting production methods, should have to compete with cheap imports from countries that refuse to do their bit to help combat global warming. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing the creation of a carbon tax.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-019" speaker_id="33569" name="Syed Kamall" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Caspary, on such a wide-ranging report – not surprising given the title of Global Europe – and I welcome its general tone. However, I have a few concerns and worries about a few possible contradictions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I read a report calling for all so-called ‘public’ services to be kept out of trade negotiations, including media services. But surely focusing on media services goes against the grain of the Lisbon Agenda, which aims to make the EU a leading digital economy? However, even if we leave media services aside, are we really going to ignore citizens in poorer countries who have to put up with poor or non-existent health, education, water and transport services run by poorly-performing state monopolies or companies often linked to corrupt or inefficient politicians? I urge my fellow Members to listen to the citizens and not the politicians of these countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also see Paragraph 80 supporting the view that trade defence instruments need not be reviewed, but I ask that the Commission no longer succumb to the protectionist sentiments of uncompetitive companies. For example, TDIs have made shoes more expensive for poor families, especially those with children, and penalise those EU companies that have grasped the opportunity provided by globalisation and global supply chains, creating high-value research, design and marketing jobs in the EU while outsourcing low-value jobs to Asia. In truth, TDIs mean that the Commission listens more to uncompetitive European companies than it does to consumers, retailers and global EU suppliers and I do not believe that they will save one European manufacturing job in the long run.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I do not wish to dwell only on my concerns. The report rightly confirms that the benefits of liberalisation outweigh any disruptive impact and that those countries that lift tariffs and non-tariff barriers and open up their markets benefit most. It also highlights the problem that the new French President will have to grapple with, in that protectionism leads to unemployment. For these reasons, I commend the report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-020" speaker_id="28308" name="Elisa Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur. Europe today needs to clarify where it stands in the globalised economy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As socialists – and I was shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – we unequivocally advocate the World Trade Organisation’s multilateral framework. The relative deadlock, however, on the Doha talks has led the Commission and our main partners to seek temporary solutions by means of bilateral or regional trade agreements. This is clearly not the ideal strategy and it will only be acceptable if the agreements are compatible with the success of the Doha talks and include minimum environmental and social conditions conforming to the internationally recognised standards such as decent work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to point out, however, that the unilateral review of trade defence instruments, as the rapporteur said, is totally inappropriate. Furthermore, it must be inferred that the economically powerful partners, that is to say those with negotiating power equivalent to that of the European Union, are to be treated differently from the least developed countries or those with serious development problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the former – Korea, India, Brazil, Mexico, China and Indonesia – the time has come for the EU to demand a measure of reciprocity in the areas of market access, respect for intellectual property, compliance with trade rules, investment policy and competition. Europe’s citizens demand this. However, this reciprocity can never be required of vulnerable countries or those with development problems. On the contrary, this strategy will give the EU extra responsibilities in relation to such countries; the EU must make it possible for international trade to be used to speed up development in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Of course, it will not be easy to strike a balance between these objectives. I hope it will be possible, however, to find a spirit of compromise and sufficient consensus between the various political groups, so that the European citizens we represent in this Chamber can feel more secure in the face of the uncertainties of globalisation.</p>

    <intervention id="2-021" speaker_id="28411" name="Ignasi Guardans Cambó" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, when we talk about the competitiveness of global Europe, we are not talking about a theoretical or academic issue, we are talking about creating wealth, about creating jobs, about well-being for our citizens, about Europe's role in the world, about its responsibilities, and about how it exercises them, with regard to its neighbours, its commercial partners and also with regard to those in the weakest position, who may suffer most as a result of what has come to be known as globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">On behalf of my group, I would like to welcome Mr Caspary’s report, to which, in the subsequent vote, we shall add certain amendments that will improve and expand on some of its statements, not with a view to removing anything, but with a view to contributing certain ideas to support the amendments presented by other groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">Trade and the free market are not a dogma. They are not a religious truth that must be defended in all circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a reality, a fact, that only free trade, with clear and fair rules for everybody, can contribute to creating wealth, well-being and development. Protectionism can never do that, and there has never been any evidence that it contributes anything. Free trade, the openness of markets at global level, lead indirectly to the creation of greater individual freedoms for those who benefit from that freedom. We are therefore in favour of the opening up of markets and liberalisation, not because we are defending a dogma or a religious truth, or a principle to which we are politically attached, but because its benefits are absolutely clear.</p>
      <p sl="es">When the European Union defends that same principle, it is defending, in the new strategy of a global Europe, this openness of the markets at global level, and it must also fulfil its own responsibilities. The European Union has serious responsibilities. It has them when it represents us and when it defends us.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, and my group agrees with what other spokespeople have said in this regard, this is not the time to revise the commercial defence instruments, it is a time, perhaps, to adjust them, but not to remove them, not to modify them, because it is the European Union’s responsibility not to lose sight of the restrictions that still exist, in many cases non-tariff restrictions, which are gradually being imposed. I would highlight one of them that we have had the opportunity to discuss: the commercial denigration suffered by European products in certain countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union also has a responsibility when it negotiates on our behalf, when it calls for access to the services market, when it negotiates in the field of public tenders.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is very important that our commercial policy is not just compatible, but also that it fits perfectly, with our development policy. I am not saying that that is not the case already, but there is a risk that we could have a commercial policy that does not run parallel with our obligations in the field of development. We shall therefore also table some amendments to this report in order to clarify this notion.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, essentially, globalisation represents an opportunity for Europe. I would like to thank the rapporteur for making this concept clear in his report. I would also like to impress it most especially on our colleagues from the Left, who are mainly responsible for associating free trade with unemployment and social disaster.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we are to avoid the negative consequences of global trade and gain the upper hand in competition at a global level, we must sort out our own system for allocating resources. Currently, excessive regulation and control of the common market within the European Union itself is distorting the latter. We are slowly letting this opportunity slip by where services and the labour market in the European Union are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are still not exploiting all the competitive advantages that could be gained from a common Euro-Atlantic market. Instead of spreading alarm regarding cheaper services, labour and tax competition, we should be deriving common benefits from this situation. We must compete in this race and make every effort to win it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, political persuasions aside, in November 2006 the governments adopted the general guidelines proposed by the Commission, and the Commission has now formally entered into negotiations, not least with South Korea and the ASEAN countries, on the basis of mandates decided on by the Council, on the proposal of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In these matters, let us recall, the European Parliament merely has the power of speech and must make do with an assent procedure at the end of the term. The same is true, I might add, for the national parliaments. Trade negotiations remain a prerogative of the national and Community executives, which is something that we have been criticising for 25 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should like it, in fact, if the European Parliament in particular were involved in defining the negotiating mandates via a codecision procedure and if a follow-up procedure could then be genuinely implemented, and, from this point of view, I believe that, as interesting as they are, the appearances made by Mr Mandelson before our committee are not enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second message concerns rules. Since the Bruntland report, we have been calling for international trade rules to be adapted to the major demands of a new means of development benefiting all the peoples of our small planet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It hardly needs pointing out, Commissioner, that the ecological footprint of our current lifestyles here in Europe represents three times the Earth's capacities. This state of affairs would therefore be intolerable if it were to become more widespread; that is the simple reason why international standards relating to the environment and social conditions must urgently be enforced, and not just encouraged, in these trade negotiations, an opinion that is unfortunately shared by neither the Commission nor the majority of this House, blinded as they are by short-term interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For these, and many other, reasons, and particularly in view of the impact that these negotiations could have on the future development of European legislation, my entire group will reject this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, with whom I sit on the same committee, has produced a report that is, in essence, a repetition of what is expressed in the Commission’s ‘Global Europe’ strategy, a foreign trade policy edition of the Lisbon Strategy, and something that I can no more endorse than I can the market access strategy that was published in April or the policy to be found in the new free trade agreements, which follows on seamlessly from it. The pre-eminent object of both the strategy and its implementation is to secure European businesses better access to the markets of third countries, and there is no a priori objection to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">By way of the abolition of – if at all possible – all barriers to trade, the attempt is being made to subject not only tariffs but also measures of consumer policy, environmental policy, social policy and development policy to the principle of competitiveness, as free trade oriented thinking requires, while, at the same time, it is proposed that the European Union’s trade protection instruments be applied more consistently and that the protection of intellectual property – by which is meant ‘patents’ – be extended. Since it is evident that there is little chance of any multilateral agreement within the WTO on that sort of one-sided preferential treatment for mainly larger European enterprises, the Commission and the Council are becoming more and more open about their desire to see European economic interests prevail by way of bilateral and regional agreements that go well beyond what is actually meant to be debated in the Doha round, featuring such things as the deregulation of investments, of public tendering, and of competition policy. My group cannot agree to a policy that has ceased to have anything to do with the establishment of a fair and multilateral system of trade; treating the weak and the strong the same way is not the same thing as giving them fair treatment, when what is needed is a fair trade agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, though, one right and important point in the Caspary report that I should like to highlight, and it is that it cannot be acceptable that almost all major European decisions at the European level are taken without the European Parliament having any power of codecision over them. This afternoon we will have more to say about economic partnership agreements. Yes, Commissioner, it is true that the committee is the scene of lively exchanges with you and with the Trade Directorate-General, but the Committee on International Trade is not provided with the drafts of documents. For as long as that sort of secret diplomacy is going on within the European Parliament, it is only understandable that many of the EU’s citizens will take a more and more sceptical view of what the European Union does.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I believe in free trade. It has benefited my country and is an important tool in helping the world’s poorest nations escape from poverty. However, the EPAs do more harm than good to the cause of free trade because of the hypocrisy of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the face of it, opening up our markets to imports from these countries sounds very good as it will help boost their economies, but, as always, there is a flip side to the coin. The developing countries have to open up their markets to goods from Europe, to drop their import tariffs – according to the EU’s timescale by the end of the year – and, if they will not, up will go European trade barriers and down will come the amount of European aid. You cannot run before you can walk. As the rapporteur notes, the facilities are not yet in place in many ACP countries for revenue collection to replace tariffs as a principal source of government funding.</p>
      <p sl="de">In trying to force the pace, I believe we are doing more harm than good to the cause of global free trade. Furthermore, who do we think we are to be bullying these nations into scrapping tariffs? After all, only last year the Commission brought in tariffs on shoes from China. But that was not free trade, or fair for that matter. We were told that they were dumping subsidised products on us. But what are we doing with our surplus agricultural products, subsidised by the CAP? Exactly the same thing: we are dumping them on poor countries and, in the process, dragging their farmers into poverty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur says that EPAs are going to be concluded between the EU and many ACP countries. This may well be true, but only because the EU holds the whip hand. ‘Partnership’ it may be called, but it is a most unequal partnership. It suits big business but it does not suit the developing countries. The health and environment standards in Europe are so high that the potential for many ACP countries to export their agricultural produce will be very limited.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is more, the Commission’s own impact assessment suggests that signing these deals could well precipitate the collapse of manufacturing in West Africa. As a citizen of a country that has historically espoused and promoted genuine free trade, I do not want to be complicit in this. It only adds to my determination that my country will negotiate its own trading arrangements and leave this appalling European Union, which, for all its pious talk of relieving poverty and encouraging development, has actually been directly responsible for causing poverty on a massive scale throughout the developing countries of the world.</p>

În acest context se înscrie şi reacţia negativă pe care cetăţenii europeni o au faţă de procesul delocalizării unor întreprinderi productive spre noile state membre în scopul utilizării unei forţe de muncă mai ieftine. Am remarcat o astfel de reacţie negativă şi în timpul campaniei electorale prezidenţiale din Franţa, şi m-a deranjat faptul că România este prezentată ca o ţară care ar atrage aceste delocalizări, prejudiciind situaţia locurilor de muncă în alte ţări membre ale Uniunii. Se vorbeşte chiar de o politică de dumping social pe care ar practica-o România. Constat, cu regret, lipsa de informaţii pe care o au cetăţenii europeni şi insist pe nevoia unei informări nu numai ample, dar şi mai corecte.</p>
      <p sl="en">În acest sens ar trebui ştiut că România, prin strategia sa de postaderare, nu încurajează delocalizarea, deoarece, în multe cazuri, prin aceasta se produc dezechilibre majore din punctul de vedere al protecţiei mediului, se dezvoltă ramuri industriale energofage şi utilizatoare de muncă slab calificată. Interesul actual al României este dezvoltarea unor ramuri industriale moderne, care să ridice gradul de competitivitate al economiei, şi nu aglomerarea pe teritoriul ţării a unui amalgam de întreprinderi, deplasate tehnic şi tehnologic. Iată de ce consider că delocalizarea este un proces care nu avantajează pe nimeni în interiorul Uniunii şi apare ca fiind extrem de necesară adoptarea unei strategii care să permită ca într-adevăr mondializarea să contribuie la respectarea interesului, nu numai al Uniunii, dar şi al diferitelor ţări membre în parte.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are some good things in this report – the importance of the transatlantic relationship, the progressive reduction of tariffs on transatlantic trade, the importance of trade liberalisation and the fact that protectionism leads to unemployment – and yet the report is practically schizophrenic on customs duties. On the one hand it commends what it calls ‘the success of the EU’s customs union’, despite Europe’s long-term economic decline compared to Asia and the US, and on the other hand it calls for the progressive reduction of tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must make up our minds. Trade barriers are either good or bad – they cannot be both at the same time. The fact is that customs unions are a 19th-century Bismarckian concept and they have no place in the 21st century. It is time to abandon the EU’s common external tariff and to create a European free-trade area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also commends the European social model and the updated Lisbon Agenda, yet we all know that the Lisbon Agenda is a dead letter. We talk about it but fail to put it into action, while EU competitiveness slips ever further behind our competitors. I well remember our British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in this very Chamber, asking the question: What sort of social model is it that leaves 20 million unemployed across Europe? Answer: the European social model. I also remember a visit to Singapore when the then Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, was asked by our colleague Mr Corbett why a prosperous country like Singapore had such poor social benefits and unemployment pay. Mr Goh Chok Tong replied: ‘We find that when we pay people to be unemployed we get a lot of unemployed people, so we don’t do that’. That is the wisdom of the Orient, and we would do well to bear it in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is only one way forward for a competitive Europe: we need Konrad Adenauer’s ‘bonfire of the regulations’. We need major reductions in taxes and in social and employment costs. Then, perhaps, we can start to compete in the world.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, access for exporters and undertakings to the markets of numerous important trading partners of the Union is not always easy. It comes up against high tariffs and technical barriers, non-transparent and unfair practices, administrative and fiscal barriers and, in general, the incomplete application of the principle of national treatment.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would also like to emphasise, as the rapporteur Mr Caspary also mentioned, the ineffective protection of intellectual and industrial property rights at global level.</p>
      <p sl="el">Another parameter which affects the reduced competitiveness of European products and services is the obligation to comply with stricter product, public health, environmental and consumer safety specifications and health and safety regulations.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am not in favour of watering down the European regulatory framework; I am in favour of pursuing terms of reciprocity with our trading partners.</p>
      <p sl="el">Furthermore, at both bilateral and multilateral level, we need to ensure that not only economic dumping, as it applies today, but also social and ecological dumping are avoided.</p>
      <p sl="el">In this particular instance, the European Union is rightly pursuing, within the framework of current WTO negotiations, the abolition of import duty on so-called ‘green goods’. At the same time, however, the possibility needs to be examined of imposing a ‘green tax’ on imports from states not bound by the Kyoto Protocol, in order to counterbalance the competitive disadvantage of European undertakings and prevent them from possibly relocating to areas with more flexible environmental rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to address a number of points relating to Mr Caspary’s report and to the Commission proposal that are of importance to my group.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would very much like to thank the Commissioner for being courageous enough to raise these issues in the first place and for proposing that the European Union change its strategy, something that this House had called for back in 2002, when it was I who proposed that we look more to Asia where agreements are concerned, so you have my heartfelt thanks for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem is, though, that the global economy has been undergoing fundamental changes since 2002. Along with China, other players have entered the game, and the proposed countries – Korea, for example, and some ASEAN states, along with India – are no longer developing countries in the traditional sense of the word, but already have emergent economies and have become extremely competitive, yet, within some of them, great poverty predominates, which presents the European Union with challenges, and that means that we will have to follow through with a well-thought out strategy that promotes fairness in trade with these countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will have to strike a balance by, on the one hand, taking decisions on the opening up of markets together with the countries concerned and on a case-by-case basis, while also, of course, insisting on standards in the areas of environmental protection and safety in the workplace, and also, of course, in that of intellectual property. Achieving that balance will be a difficult business.</p>
      <p sl="de">You said, Commissioner, that you had already accorded Parliament more rights by entrusting it with the decision on the mandate. That is indeed so, and I would like to express my gratitude for it, but I would nevertheless ask you for your continued support as we demand of the Council that we should, in future, be granted the right of assent, which will be a considerable help in developing a proper trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mr Caspary and my colleague Mrs Ferreira, who acted as shadow rapporteur, for the report itself and for their willingness to cooperate with us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s ongoing commitment to fostering increasingly open markets must not prevent Europe itself from promoting its own interests in this globalised world. The Lisbon Strategy represents an ambitious target on which we can all agree, and enables us to take up the challenge that the European Union’s competitors have set us.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must bear in mind, however, that the great trade and development game is often not played on a level field, and this lack of reciprocity, even though justified by the fact that many countries have started developing late, penalises our production systems and has serious social consequences. While maintaining our commitment to a multilateral approach, we must also pursue bilateral agreements if necessary. Our policy is one of opening up the market, steadily reducing customs duties, and creating a level playing field for competition. In this context, our policies on innovation, the opening-up of markets and support for the restructuring of ageing and no longer competitive productive sectors should go hand in hand with measures to safeguard intellectual property and with commercial protection more generally, as indicated in the Green Paper and acutely taken up in the Caspary report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let us dare to put an end to the myth: free trade no longer reduces poverty and no longer stimulates development. The latest studies published by the World Bank evaluate the almost non-existent profits made, and of those almost non-existent profits, the bulk went to China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we take account of the disappearance of customs duties, the balance sheet becomes particularly negative for developing countries. Capitalist globalisation does not orchestrate competition between the large multinationals; it protects them. On the other hand, it creates a harsh form of competition between the social and fiscal systems that have been chosen democratically by the citizens of each nation. One of the consequences of free trade is, moreover, a wholesale shift of the corporate tax burden onto households. That is why the great sentences in the report about the preservation of the European social model are nothing but dramatic expressions designed to get the tears flowing. If we want to get away from this, we need to replace the principle of free trade with that of fair trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fall in the dollar and the yen is bleeding industrial employment dry in the euro zone. And the report invites the Commission to … invite! Tartuffe could not have put it better! There is not a single word on the iniquitous desire to tone down the anti-dumping regulations on the pretext that they harm certain financial interests, namely European ones. Because we are here to serve Europeans and not speculative investment companies, let us choose cooperation over competitiveness, let us choose a form of rational protectionism that relies on social and ecological customs duties, and let us establish a control on exchange and movement of capital.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I firmly believe, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that if we persevere with this headlong flight towards free trade, the Union will go straight to the wall, with its foot down, shouting at the top of its voice!</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his even-handed report, which can count on my support during tomorrow’s vote.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As rapporteur for EU-China relations, I was particularly interested in the paragraphs on trade relations with the People's Republic, but I was taken aback by the wording in paragraph 44, because I certainly do not see China as the most obvious illustration of a country that has had a positive impact on trade liberalisation and has actively participated in global and competitive markets. In fact, to judge by the long list of concerns and points of difference that follows, the rapporteur shares my view on this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Quite apart from the problems in the social and environmental fields, and our concerns about the protection of European intellectual property, I should also like to make a point of mentioning the inadequate access that is being gained by European companies to the Chinese market and dumping practices in China, something which is also harmful to European industry. After all, the Chinese are protecting their own market from foreign competition whilst giving their own manufacturers undue preference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">An open economy in a globalising world is often – and erroneously – confused with an economy without barriers. Fortunately, the rapporteur has not opted to do so. In paragraph 17 of his report, Mr Gaspari is right to refer to the damage incurred by the European economy at the hands of countries that flout trade rules. As a reaction, the European Union should protect itself against unfair trade practices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would therefore urge the Commission to spell out, both within and outside of a WTO context, that the Union does not tolerate unfair behaviour. This means, however, that the EU must also be prepared to put actual sanctions in place by means of adequate trade protective instruments, not resulting from a protectionist knee-jerk reaction, but from the realisation that in some cases, only sanctions will help guarantee a level playing field for the EU’s industries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the report by our fellow member from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Caspary, takes a near caricatural approach to stating the benefits of globalisation and of the European Union's trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, it sees only advantages to it: the opening up of markets, in particular public procurement markets, increased competition, the benefits of competition and worldwide free trade, but with a slight dampener where intellectual property rights are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In contrast, protectionism is condemned irrevocably, and customs duties are held up to public obloquy as intolerable insults to the Trade god. Faced with the all-powerful ultraliberals of the European Parliament and of the Commission, it will be interesting to see what Mr Sarkozy’s government is going to do to protect our businesses, in particular, our SMEs-SMIs, our agriculture and our public services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With Europe already being the world’s most open economic unit, it is paradoxical to want to go further, unless we want to sacrifice our agriculture and our industry on purpose, and once and for all. And yet, that is what the Europe of Brussels is doing, in the name of competition and of the pro-free trade dogma and in order to satisfy our US allies. Under these circumstances, with no trade protection worthy of the name, with no effective instruments of protection and with no European officials who are independent of the Anglo-Saxon lobbies, what can Europe do to prevent businesses from relocating and skilled workers and capital from going abroad? It can rely on thousand-year-old nations, and not on the ultra-European mirage defended by Mr Caspary, one that guarantees serious disillusionment for Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within the WTO Europe has always – often alone and at the expense of its own immediate economic interests – stood up for the strict interpretation of the rules of the system and carefully watched out for any practices that might cause distortions in the domestic and international market. For these rules to make any sense, the EU must strongly insist that they must also be applied by the other members, particularly our direct competitors.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also important that such rules should be periodically adjusted to the constant changes in commercial practices and in the productive system, as in the recent cases involving relocation, in order to safeguard not only the quality and number of jobs within the EU, but also respect for social and environmental standards in countries outside Europe. In that respect it is important to encourage and speed up the procedures currently under way for creating the European quality mark and protecting intellectual property, so that the competitiveness of our businesses, particularly of our smaller enterprises, and the quality of our production can be safeguarded both within and beyond our borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">As a member of the Committee on Development, I feel I have to point out that a flexible and gradual approach is in any case necessary for those developing countries which, before the market is fully opened up, are committed to providing for the basic needs of their own peoples: fair access to clean water, education and efficient health systems, for example, which are essential preconditions for subsequent sustainable economic development.</p>

    <intervention id="2-036" speaker_id="28126" name="Christofer Fjellner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sv">First of all, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Caspary. I have to say that this is one of the best reports on trade policy I have seen in Parliament, clearly stating that free trade promotes prosperity and that protectionism promotes poverty. It is a positive step forwards that we are able to state this together in the European Parliament. The Commission’s Global Europe initiative on the external dimension of competitiveness is also extremely constructive. Trade policy ought of course to have been part of the Lisbon Agenda from the very beginning. To talk about European competitiveness without talking about our trade with the surrounding world is otherwise just to spout empty words.</p>
      <p sl="sv">While you are still here, I should like to take the opportunity to put two points of view to you, Mr Mandelson.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, I have noticed that the Commission often talks about competitiveness, but then almost only of the importance of increasing market access and reducing customs duties in other countries. However, it is at least as important to increase access and other countries’ opportunities to come here and to reduce our own duties. It would not only give European consumers and companies cheaper products but would also make for keener competition and thus increase our competitiveness in relation to the surrounding world. Reducing our own duties is, then, at least as important as others doing so.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The other matter I wish to address is the need to reform trade defence instruments. On that matter, I do not really agree with the report before us. I understand that a very great deal of pressure was placed on the Commission after that initiative was put forward. Unfortunately, that pressure appears to have led to a lower level of ambition on the part of the Commission. The rhetoric has shifted from talk of reform to talk of an overhaul, but I expect the Commission to present a reform of the trade defence instruments that is worthy of the name. That the EU should defend us from trade is, of course, as stupid as it sounds.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also refer to one of my favourite examples of absurd trade barriers, namely the EU’s peculiar duties on low-energy light bulbs as, at the same time as we worry about the greenhouse effect and talk about banning ordinary light bulbs, we protect ourselves from the import of low-energy light bulbs by means of high duties.</p>
      <p sl="sv">No, Mr Mandelson, we must carry out a thoroughgoing reform of the trade defence instruments without delay.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-037" speaker_id="4318" name="Harlem Désir" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to confine myself to making four remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, Commissioner, I believe that you were right to stress the fact that the strategy of a global Europe must not mean ceasing to give priority to multilateral negotiations. There is a great deal of enthusiasm, but also a great many illusions, regarding the contribution that bilateral free trade agreements can make. We are told that we must have such agreements because others have made a commitment along these lines, including, for example, the United States. In fact, the United States has signed only six or seven free trade agreements, which represent scarcely 5% of its external trade. The other agreements have failed, because they pose the same problems as in the multilateral framework, with, generally speaking, the same kind of partners. I should like to add that these negotiations often result in agreements that are more unbalanced towards developing countries, to the obvious advantage of developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This leads me to my second remark: in moving from the multilateral context to the bilateral context, we must not abandon the trade policy development objectives along the way. From this point of view, Mr Caspary, I do not believe that it can be said that trade policy is unrelated to other dimensions: development, the fight against poverty, the environment and social policy. The fact is, the relationship between trade and development and trade and poverty reduction is not automatic. For example, it is said that, if Africa does not trade, it will remain poor. That is true. But does it mean that any trade agreement with Africa will necessarily benefit it? No, that is not true. We need to take account of a more differentiated, controlled, form of liberalisation, which caters for the fragile sectors of a number of countries. This is not the case solely for the poorest countries; it is also the case for emerging countries, countries such as India, which are among those with the poorest populations in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, this global Europe strategy should not result in the re-introduction of subjects that have been excluded from the multilateral framework. I am thinking of the Singapore issues and of the negotiations on investment, public contracts and public services. The re-introduction of these subjects is not justifiable; it will result in the same problems, in the same standstills, or else these subjects will be forcibly imposed, when they go beyond the trade rules and concern the internal regulation of sensitive sectors, such as access to essential services, to public services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly – and I shall conclude on this point – like Mr Jonckheer, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that the Union, through its trade policy too, is working to implement social rules and environmental rules. These rules are being implemented by means of the enhanced system of generalised preferences and no longer in the free trade agreements, and I regret this because we should also promote compliance, for instance, with the ILO rules.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the European Commission should provide more information on its proposed trade policy, not only to Parliament but also, most especially, to its citizens. At present, Europeans in many different countries are afraid of the WTO and of its actions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A greater effort must be made to explain to the citizens the principle that a free trade policy leads to economic growth, job creation and sustainable development around the world, providing that the policy is based on partnership and that it is increasingly balanced and honest. In addition, such a policy should be inspired in our own European social and environmental standards. We lay great store by that. On the one hand, there should be a free market and free competition, and on the other, European environmental and social standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, this is wishful thinking, but these two sets of values must come together at some stage. That is what you should work towards, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Caspary, on this very good report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Due to the fact that globalisation imposes unprecedented changes, the European Union must today carry out the necessary reforms that will enable it to get the very most out of globalisation. One of these reforms is based on the adaptation of European trade policy to the challenges of competitiveness. We must, in fact, put an end to the rationale that draws a parallel between, on the one hand, globalisation, and, on the other, the decline in European manufacturing and job losses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe must be able to become an area of synergies and of industrial cooperation. To achieve this, everything hinges on its attractiveness, specialisation and defence. Europe must therefore conduct policies promoting an environment that is conducive to the spirit of enterprise, production and job creation. As the key actors in these policies, SMEs must therefore have easy access to public contracts, as we note already happens in the United States. If they are to be more comprehensive, more integrated and focused on the future, these policies must not abandon the agricultural sector, which is a strategic trade instrument of the European Union, not a bargaining chip. It would have been timely, moreover, for this communication to have made reference to the agricultural sector, just as it makes reference to the services sector and to high value added goods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In parallel with this proactive attitude, Europe must also be a protector. The performance of the European Union in relation to the emerging economies is today compromised by a lack of reciprocity concerning market access conditions and by the proliferation of unfair trade practices. Faced with this loss of pace, Europe must adopt a more resolute stance. It must thus be able to protect itself from economic, social and environmental dumping by means of trade defence instruments, which are at present the only stopgap measures there to make up for the absence of internationally-recognised trade rules. As we can see, the external competitiveness of the European Union will be guaranteed and this, by means of its ability to attack and to defend itself.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is true, we are facing globalisation, and there are two possible ways to react to it: to be led by events or to try to manage it, to intervene in it, ultimately to regulate it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that that is our intention through our trade policy, and, in my view, that is the intention of the European Commission’s Communication and, generally speaking, of Mr Caspary’s report as well.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must send a very clear message to our citizens in the debate that we are holding today. Our intention is not simply to grab our quota of the market, regardless of other criteria. We want to be present on the world market, but in doing so we want to promote both the strengthening of the European social model and the spreading of wealth, hence reducing poverty throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">This must be achieved in a multilateral manner, first and foremost. The World Trade Organisation is still the European Union’s preferred means for intervening in globalisation. In this regard, we must continue to make every possible effort to conclude the Doha Development Round.</p>
      <p sl="es">Until this happens, out of responsibility towards our citizens and also towards the citizens of the countries with which we wish to establish free trade agreements, we must promote this second instrument.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Caspary's report takes up elements that are very important to Socialists and Social Democrats. These include paragraph 20, on the rules of the International Labour Organisation, or paragraph 65, which clearly differentiates commercial services from public services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, if the Caspary report were to take up our Amendments 43 and 52, it would be much better oriented towards our intentions. Even so, I believe that this report makes a positive contribution.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say, as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that I hope and pray that the Council will agree to implement what the Constitution, which is in the process of ratification or modification, provides for: not just assent, but also participation in the mandate, in the monitoring of negotiations, and hence the full representation of the citizens in something that, at the end of the day, has a very clear effect on their daily lives.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to highlight three issues in my contribution to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The subject of the report before us is the development of trade, and I should like to say first of all that this must not be deemed an end in itself. It must be perceived in terms of its impact on economic growth, including European production, and in terms of its impact on trends in the European labour market and on the balanced development of the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the statements contained in the report regarding market openness are correct, providing they are based on the principle of reciprocity and on respect for the principles of fair competition. The EU often opens up its market in circumstances when its foreign partners have no intention of observing reciprocity and certainly not the principles of fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, it is particularly important for these principles to be complied with where trade in food products is concerned. Some of the Union’s partners have failed to abide by the principles of fair competition in this regard, leading to cutbacks in many areas of farming within Europe. Production has even ceased completely in some cases. Europe will find it very difficult, if not impossible to restart activity in the future, in a situation where foreign partners are able to set the prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to make three points. The first is to thank Mr Caspary for doing an excellent job on this report and to congratulate him on continuing a good, free-trade, liberal line.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point is that I am a supporter of free trade and multilateralism. However, I understand that in the current Doha Round we have to take some measures, which we do not necessarily like, on the line of bilateralism, but we have to stick to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to say to Mr Mandelson that it is very good that he is promoting us as a superpower in trade: over 20% of world trade is with us, 20% with the US. When we talk on trade people listen, and that is why it is very important to find a balance between free trade and protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the trade defence instrument itself, I am a bit iffy – for example, I like Chinese tennis shoes! – and therefore I should like the Commissioner to be careful about that and not push it too far. We do not want to become a European Colbert state.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final point concerns globalisation, in particular the sales of globalisation. I am very saddened when I listen to the likes of Jean-Marie Le Pen – which I do not do very often. It seems as if globalisation has become the scapegoat for everything: everything that is bad is thanks to globalisation and everything that is good is thanks to the Member State itself. This is the wrong way to approach things. I really do not want the European Union to become a modern Colbert, in other words, a mercantilist, which believes in its own exports but wants to prevent imports from elsewhere. That is not what we are about: our basic line is about the free movement of goods, services, people and money, and we need to promote that worldwide as well.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out a few fundamental principles and express some concerns about the new trade strategy being advocated today by the Commission and taken up in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Caspary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first principle to point out is that priority must always be given to multilateralism. We know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements seriously harms the regulated multilateral structure, to which we adhere. The second principle is that we should not undermine the Union’s commitment to a trade policy that promotes development, a policy integrating non-commercial dimensions, such as decent work, access to medicines, the environment and the eradication of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for my concerns, they relate to three points. The first is that priority is no longer given to the pro-development dimension of the Doha Round in the future free trade agreements and the new EU trade agenda, even though the EU’s trade policy objectives should always be compatible with its development policy and should usefully supplement it, particularly where social and environmental issues are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second object of concern is the scope of these agreements, which go far beyond the current WTO provisions. For example, the principle of full reciprocity to which we aim to give priority, including for emerging countries faced with large-scale poverty, is unacceptable. We must enable developing countries temporarily to protect the fragile and sensitive sectors of their economies. In short, we must not impose on others that which we do not know how to impose on ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My last concern, to conclude, relates to the provisions aimed at negotiating on the so-called Singapore issues. These very controversial issues were excluded from the Doha Round following widespread opposition from developing and emerging countries. The controversy had previously resulted in the failure of Cancún.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that these issues, which are as complex for the Union as they are for our partners, raise sensitive questions, relating to internal policy and, therefore, to the very sovereignty of the Member States. These issues could, moreover, have a considerable impact on the economic and social models and, therefore, on the very development of our partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is vital that the Union does not push for these issues to be included in the negotiations. Nothing could justify that which has been thrown out the door of a multilateral round coming back in through the narrow window of a bilateral agreement. What is at stake here is our consistency, our credibility and a certain development model that we have always sought to promote.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-045" speaker_id="1413" name="Glyn Ford" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation for all the work that Mr Caspary has put into this report. As Commissioner Mandelson rightly said, our priority this year is to conclude the multilateral Doha development round. Alongside this, there are complementary negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with South Korea, ASEAN and India.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Caspary’s report lays down a template within which we must try to operate in these negotiations, not because of Mr Caspary but because of our committee. The report however contains its contradictions, I think, as Mr Helmer said, it is positively schizophrenic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some members of my group complain that the report is not development-friendly. I am not sure it was intended to be as our imminent negotiations are with countries like Singapore and South Korea, Thailand and India, countries not really in anyone’s less-developed countries category any more. Within ASEAN, Laos and Cambodia are covered by the EU’s ‘anything but arms’ policy and therefore have a degree of protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome paragraph 30 of the report, which takes into account the interests of the smallest and weakest countries. I certainly welcome paragraph 32 that demands that ILO standards on decent work be included in future FTAs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have some sympathy with Mr Kamall’s points with regard to audiovisual services, though I have to say that the privatisation of health, education, drinking water and energy rarely helps the poor in developing countries; rather it helps the minority rich population.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome paragraph 33, which makes it easier to suspend free trade agreements when they are not fulfilled, particularly with respect to social clauses. Yet for some in the PSE Group, it is paragraph 29 which is the killer paragraph. It demands far-reaching liberalisation of services. My group met yesterday and narrowly decided that it could not support the report if this and similar paragraphs were included.</p>

    <intervention id="2-046" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have heard some very well informed and very intelligent contributions to this debate. I appreciate them and thank those who have taken the trouble to speak.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the spirit, if not absolutely every letter, both of my own approach and of Mr Caspary’s report was captured by Mr Fjellner when he said that free trade spreads prosperity while protectionism spreads poverty. Broadly speaking, I think that is correct but I would say that free trade is a necessary but insufficient condition to bring about economic development and poverty alleviation in some of the more needy countries of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with those, including Mr Désir, who would like the Commission to operate a principle of proportionate reciprocity as far as developing countries are concerned. I agree with that and my approach reflects the capacities of the developing country markets in question. The EU asks of trading partners only what their level of development allows but, as others have pointed out, the sorts of economies that are seeking free trade agreements with us – Korea, the ASEAN countries, India – could hardly be described as typical least-developed countries in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Arif focused on the so-called Singapore issues, as did Mr Désir himself. All I can say in this regard is that, if partner countries decide that they wish to discuss these issues bilaterally with the European Union as a means of promoting their own development and creating economic opportunities for them, why should they not do so? I do not think it is for us in Europe to tell developing countries and emerging economies that they should not be addressing issues like investment, competition and transparency in government procurement.</p>
      <p sl="en">One or two honourable Members have alluded to trade defence. Mr Caspary did at the outset and Mr Guardans Cambó has done so subsequently, as has Mrs Saïfi. There is no question in my mind of removing Europe’s right of recourse to anti-dumping measures. Trade defence instruments are a vital way of ensuring fair trade where goods have been produced in conditions of subsidy or where price distortion is taking place. Of course that should not be confused with the ordinary low-cost advantages in trade for many developing countries. Our purpose in using trade defence instruments is not to protect European business from fair low-cost competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that from time to time I sometimes encounter those seeking use of TDI because they are afraid of competition, not because they want to engage fairly in competition. But I think that a periodic review allows us to ensure that public confidence in these instruments is maintained and to make sure that, if necessary, these instruments can change in order to reflect a changing world. That is all we are doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to go back to one or two points that have been made. As regards the question of services liberalisation, I have quite a lot of sympathy with Mr Kamall’s point. Yes, we will be looking at market opening in the services sector in our bilateral FTA negotiations, but this will be a negotiation where our partners will maintain the right to regulate their services sectors and their right to decide whether or not to open public services sectors. That is for them to decide. It is not for us to impose.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also glad that one or two honourable Members have focused on the issue of labour conditions, social conditions and environmental conditions amongst our trading partners. I passionately believe that sustainable development, which touches on all those issues, is an overarching objective for trade policy as well. One trade and environment issue that we have pursued vigorously in the Doha talks, but which some countries have opposed, is lowering tariffs on environmental goods. Many environmental problems could be addressed by helping this trade. In future FTAs we will also continue to include commitments to standards at the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members will know that we run into some opposition from our negotiating partners in respect of these conditions. They see them not as a way of levering up standards but as a way for those in the developed world to use new pretexts to keep their markets closed to the goods and services being exported from developing countries. So it important for us to keep a balance in these matters and certainly, as far as these issues are concerned, I strongly believe that we should be using the pressure that we have at our disposal by means of incentives, not sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Markov and Mrs Mann both touched on the issue of the role of the European Parliament. I have always been interested in and committed to close cooperation with the European Parliament in the context of the Framework Agreement that we have. Wherever possible we extend our participation with the Parliament on trade matters. That is why we have shared with Parliament the negotiating directives for the FTAs in an entirely transparent way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like just to touch on something that Mr Papastamkos said. In addition to his reference to our pursuit of zero taxes for an agreed list of environmental goods, I believe and I accept that we need to examine and find a way to deal with the free-rider issue in respect of climate-friendly policies and in connection with the Kyoto Protocol. In the long term this is going to become an increasingly important feature of the climate change debate. I think it is premature to think of a carbon tax. In my view, there are very many practical as well as legal difficulties in pursuing that specific idea. We must be careful that any climate-friendly policies and instruments that we might develop in the future do not become protectionist instruments. However, I entirely accept that the time has come for us to look carefully at these issues, because they are going to become increasingly relevant in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank all those honourable Members who have spoken and contributed so well to this debate. I look forward to continuing and strong cooperation between myself and my services and this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I congratulate the rapporteur, and wish especially to welcome the effective collaboration of my fellow Member Mrs Elisa Ferreira. Europe takes a twofold position on globalisation: on the one hand, we are the most active and committed supporters of developing countries, because we believe in the values of democracy and of social and economic progress. On the other hand, as soon as the developing countries grow into economic competitors, we become afraid of them and see them as a threat to our own economy, our own prosperity. Yet it is untenable either within the EU or vis-à-vis third countries, that the poorer party should be a partner only as long as it remains poorer.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We must remember that in Europe, social achievements were built on an economic upswing, and not the other way around. We can only expect our partners to achieve economic and social prosperity if we allow and help them to grow wealthier. Yet it is in the developed countries, in Europe, that they are able to grow wealthier on markets with high purchasing power. If we close our markets to them, we thwart their prospects for growth.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This does not mean that we have to give up our own growth, but simply that we have to understand: we cannot be more competitive than everyone else in every field. Within current global economic conditions, it is with our technological progress, environmental awareness, intellectual products and services, and innovative competence that we can excel, and it is on these that we must build our own competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Europe must bear in mind that, in global competition, the best species of bird is the goose: it can sing, swim, run and fly. It is not the best at any of these, but can hold its own in each. An example to be taken to heart.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0088/2007) by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the EU’s Aid for Trade (2006/2236(INI).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-051" speaker_id="1403" name="David Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, before turning to the substance of this report, I should like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in the preparation of the report and in particular to thank the Commission’s Trade DG and Development DG, which, I am pleased to say, have been very keen to engage with Parliament on this particular issue. Finally, I should like to thank Pelayo Castro Zuzuarregui, the Parliament official I worked with on this report. He is leaving us for a year – we hope it is only for a year! – to work for the Spanish Prime Minister. I have worked with him on this report and a number of other reports; I have found it intellectually stimulating to be in his company and I wish him well.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the substance, Aid for Trade is a vital tool for linking developing countries to the global economy. However, I want to stress at the outset that it is not a substitute for the Doha Development Round, but a complement to it. It is clear that liberalising markets is not sufficient in itself to link developing countries into the global economy. You just have to look at the experience of the last 40 years: LDCs have seen their share of world trade almost halved from 1.9% to 1%, and this is despite tariff reductions following the Uruguay Round and other tariff reductions and recent efforts such as the European Everything but Arms scheme, which gives duty-free and quota-free access to developing countries. Therefore, liberalisation, which I would argue is important, clearly of itself has not been enough to engage the developing countries fully in the global economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also do not argue – and I want to make this clear – that Aid for Trade is of itself a panacea. However, it is quite clear that there is now a growing consensus on the benefits that Aid for Trade might bring. The WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005 set out an ambitious work programme for Aid for Trade and called for more assistance to help developing countries into the global economy. This followed Mr Barroso’s commitment at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles of GBP 1 billion of European Union money and GBP 1 billion of Member States’ money to assist in the Aid for Trade budget line.</p>
      <p sl="en">While this is all most welcome and sounded quite dramatic at the time of the announcement, we have to realise that the increases are quite modest in substance: the European Union’s contribution will increase from a base of around EUR 850 million at the moment to EUR 1 billion, while the Member States – if they deliver – will go from EUR 300 million to a EUR 1 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last October the General Affairs Council called for a trade strategy to map out how we fulfil these pledges. My report indicates some of the key points I hope we will see in that strategy. Firstly, in relation to the scope of Aid for Trade, I want the measurement of the Barroso billion to be against the existing base, which has two categories: one being trade policy and regulation, the other trade development. However, I welcome the fact that the WTO task force has added three further categories: trade-related adjustment, trade-related infrastructure and productive capacity. These are vital aspects of the Aid for Trade agenda and I hope additional resources can be found to assist developing countries to deal with such matters as the phasing-out of preferences, reductions in government revenue as a result of tariffs being lowered, or help in adjusting to new competitive pressures due to regionalisation, such as EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report argues that Aid for Trade should be demand-led and country-owned. In this context, the WTO’s enhanced integrated framework should become the key diagnostic tool for developing countries, assisting them to identify where Aid for Trade can bring maximum benefits. Within developing countries we must also ensure that the private sector and civil society are engaged with the process. While Aid for Trade undoubtedly represents a different approach to general development aid, it should, in my opinion, be based on the same fundamental principles of poverty reduction and sustainable development, and our main point of reference should continue to be the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commission’s communication published in April, and, perhaps naively, I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commission’s DGs and the European Parliament. I hope that, when the final joint EU trade strategy is adopted over the summer, it will also be reflected in that strategy document.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have called in my report today for biannual reporting back to Parliament so that we can check that the Member States and the Commission have delivered on both the quality and quantity of the aid that they are promising. All institutions so far have shown a willingness to deliver collectively on what I believe is an important strategy that can make an important, if modest, contribution to linking the poorest countries of the world into the global trading system.</p>

    <intervention id="2-052" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, David Martin, for what I regard as a very rich report on aid for trade. I am very glad that he has referred to the Millennium Development Goals, because they represent our guiding idea and targets. I agree with him that free trade, whilst a necessary condition for development, is not a magic wand, just as I agree with him that aid for trade, whilst a necessary component of any development strategy, is not a panacea.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that this report expresses a very strong commitment to the aid for trade agenda which I fully share. I have also read the very useful suggestions and guidance regarding the content of the EU joint aid for trade strategy, for which I am very grateful. Furthermore, I welcome Parliament’s engagement in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2005, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have developed a clear common vision on the main principles of aid for trade. We all agree that trade can be an important catalyst for growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but the successful integration of developing countries into the world trading system requires more than better market access and strengthening of international rules. In this respect the General Affairs Council conclusions of 14 and 15 May this year recall the crucial role of aid for trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The challenge we are now facing is to put these principles into practice in the context of the EU aid for trade strategy on which the Commission and Member States are jointly working. This strategy should set out a roadmap to meet our financial pledges, give guidance to improve the effectiveness of our aid, provide a framework on monitoring and reporting of aid for trade, and address the capacity of the Commission and Member States to deliver aid for trade. The strategy will be ready in October of this year and will then be presented at the WTO aid for trade review, so this Parliament’s report is extremely timely.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to address some specific concerns raised in the report, and first of all the issue of the broadening of the scope of aid for trade in relation to the EU financial pledges. Let me emphasise that the credibility of our pledges is of great importance and make it crystal clear that there will be no changes to the scope of our pledge. The EUR 2 billion target remains related to the categories of trade policy and trade development.</p>
      <p sl="en">I attach great importance to the wider aid for trade agenda, which includes building productive capacities beyond trade development, infrastructure and adjustment aid. For these areas, which are very capital-intensive, we need clear political commitment to do more, but let me stress once again that these efforts will not be counted in relation to our financial pledges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the lack of additional resources for EDF funding to ACP countries, we would be happy to do more, but the Commission does not decide on the budget for the EDF. EU Member States do that. There are limited exceptions only and these are also approved by Member States and dedicated to very specific purposes such as adjustment arising from the sugar reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the integrated framework, I am glad to confirm what I announced in Hong Kong. The Commission is ready to commit EUR 10 million over the first two years to the multilateral part of the enhanced integrated framework. In addition to this, the Commission will complement the multilateral window with substantial bilateral and regional funding to implement activities identified through the integrated framework and prioritised by the respective partner governments. We will also provide human resources and capacity in the field to contribute to a better functioning of the integrated framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of adjustment aid is rightly highlighted in the report. However, I do not agree that the EPA negotiations deserve a special mention in this context. Adjustment aid is relevant in relation to all external trade shocks. They may result from trade negotiations but could also be a consequence of unilateral reform as in the case of sugar. In any outcome of the EPA negotiations, the implementation of obligations of ACP partners will be phased in over a very long period and this will facilitate adjustment and identify requirements that we need to help meet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we noted your request to look into the IMF’s trade integration mechanism as part of the EU aid for trade strategy. We think that this is more appropriately addressed in cooperation with other international donors, for example as part of the global aid for trade review at WTO level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me once again express my deep appreciation for this Parliament’s political support for aid for trade, as well as our willingness to cooperate with the European Parliament to make further progress, and I look forward to doing so.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Commissioner was right to point out how trade and development cooperation are very much intertwined. If we want to achieve the Millennium Goals in 2015, aid and trade must – as they indeed can – complement one another.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The developing countries need our help in order to further develop their regional markets, and the rules of origin must be improved as a matter of priority if they are to do that. Europe and developing partners must join forces in a bid to locate a task force for development, one that can flesh out this construction of local markets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This task force should be made up of experts in the area of trade and development policy, and could help develop and implement specific trade-enhancing measures. We should, in this context, think along the lines of alternative tax revenue, the reinforcement of the production capacity and the standardisation and creation of joint external border control. Human resources, in particular, should be developed further. Practical support of this kind would be a real help in getting the local markets and mutual trade off the ground. With regard to the large infrastructure, we thought the EIB was a better bet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This trade-specific aid should not, however, come out of our own pocket; it should not, then, be funded from the existing development budget. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to see new funds made available for this, because otherwise, fewer funds would be available for achieving the Millennium Goals which are, after all, the chief goal to which the Commissioner, a moment ago, pledged 100% commitment, and in that respect we would like to wish him success.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time, we supported developing countries in all kinds of areas, except for that of trade. Partly as a result of that, countries and their economies have largely remained subsidy-dependent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Economic growth proves indispensable to fight poverty effectively. The tremendous progress which countries in Asia have made proves this point, Korea being a prime example. Little by little, we are finding out that trade offers immense opportunities for the economic growth of poor countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Invariably, developing countries still lack the right infrastructure to be able to operate within the global market. This is why these countries need our support, and this is where aid for trade comes in, whose goal is to enable developing countries to function within the international market. Thanks to aid for trade, countries can, for example, improve the rules in areas that are related to trade, such as taxes and customs, and seeking to improve the road network and waterways, to fight fraud and corruption, and both enhance production capacity and also diversify. After all, many countries depend on one agricultural product only. The diversification of products makes for a more stable economy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also necessary to increase capacity in order to train good negotiators. I welcome this aid for trade initiative, because it offers poor countries aid in order to strengthen their economies and increase their independence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As has already been mentioned, aid for trade is not a panacea for development, but a necessary tool to allow developing countries to tap into the international market. I compliment Mr Martin, the rapporteur, on the report and also thank him for his good cooperation, as a result of which the report that is before us is not only sound in terms of content, but will also enjoy widespread support.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, in order to render this instrument effective, I would ask the Commission for a sound work programme – one that is both feasible and realistic – and for good cooperation with the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the way he has dealt with this report. As ever, Mr Martin has been open and willing to engage in compromise with colleagues, producing a report which demonstrates a real consensus in the Committee on International Trade. That said, having asked the shadow rapporteurs not to bring forward amendments at the plenary stage in order to preserve the spirit of that consensus, it would have been respectful had the PSE Group kept to that agreement. Nevertheless, I think we have done enough to ensure that the consensus will hold through the plenary.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was unsurprised by the depth of common ground between us on the crucial issue of the EU’s Aid for Trade. The G8 summit in Gleneagles where the Commission and EU governments both pledged EUR 1 billion in aid to the world’s poorest people was preceded by a hugely popular campaign. Through the Make Poverty History marches, the Live Aid concerts and other efforts, millions of people have made their voices heard. They are angry, and right to be, about unfair trade rules and highly protected markets that work against those living in poverty and they are passionate about the need for change. If we are to build on the phenomenal mobilisation of public opinion, the pressure must continue at every level, domestic and international.</p>
      <p sl="de">The key question is whether there is the political will to drive that change. Aid for Trade must ensure that the poorest nations have the capacity to benefit from increased trade liberalisation, efficient customs agencies, better infrastructure, tax regimes which do not rely on import and export duties and anti-corruption measures to ensure that the money gets to the people who have earned it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately we will be judged not by how much is promised but by how much is delivered. Pledges on aid are always more easily made than kept. We are all too familiar with the double counting and relabelling tricks that recycle all pledges as new money.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU’s Aid for Trade package has a unique role to play to ensure sustainable development, growth and prosperity in the developing world. As such it must be new money over and above existing commitments and trends and it must not come at the cost of monies already earmarked for other crucial development projects such as health and education.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whilst Aid for Trade is a long-term driver of development, meeting short-term targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals, must remain central to the EU’s international development policy. There too we must do better: some USD 50 billion more a year rather than the current commitment over a five-year period. If sustained political will is required to deliver Aid for Trade, then political courage is needed to ensure we deliver the MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">Aid works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives agreed between donor and recipient. We have to concentrate on finding solutions which best fit a country’s needs. That means responding to the demands of civil society and the private sector. As a Parliament, we have already thrown our weight behind the fair trade movement.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are to help reduce the poverty in which they live, we need mechanisms to ensure the aid reaches the people who need it most. This report provides the Commission with some clear and reasonable guidelines to that end. It is up to you, Commissioner, to deliver on them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we, too, wish to thank Mr Martin for the good work he has done, and I would like to begin with a positive political development. It is good that the ‘General Affairs and Foreign Relations’ Council, which is responsible, acknowledged on 15 May that reductions in tariffs made enormous inroads into the state revenues of many developing countries, and it is good that it stressed the need for, and necessity of, compensation payments to address this. Had it not done so, we would run the risk of our trade policy possibly bringing about the rapid collapse of any development policy whatever in the countries affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is absolutely vital that we do something about this, but for that we need additional funding that cannot be set against the development aid funds if we want to achieve the millennium development goals. What has to be avoided is the occurrence of a sort of ‘displacement effect’, with a move away from the combating of poverty and from the millennium goals campaign towards promoting an orientation towards exports.</p>
      <p sl="de">That would be a misconceived tendency, one that could be triggered by the injection of these two billion in the absence of deliberate political action on our part to counteract it. In terms of development strategy, the stabilisation of local markets takes, as a rule, precedence over the preparation of the most vulnerable and poorest countries to become exporters; what matters is that our policy be consistent. ‘Aid for Trade’ must not be allowed to relativise the fight against poverty, and so it follows that additional funds are needed in order to finance it. It is in this regard that I would be really interested to know from which Budget lines the money is being taken. Moreover, ‘aid for trade’ must not be allowed to play a part in undermining the stabilisation of local markets, which must be at the heart of any development strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the Commission’s task in putting into practice the wide-ranging concept of ‘aid for trade’ and I appeal to you, Commissioner, to pay particular attention to these aspects.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, allow me to pose the following question. Why should there be Aid for Trade? The answer is because trade has an important role to play. I should now like to make a few observations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For centuries, sound trade has brought people together without detriment to their identity, values or social and political life. Europe needs to find equal partners amongst the major players on this stage and most especially amongst the lesser ones. Trade must be governed by clear rules that allow both sides to benefit. ‘Free and Fair Trade’ is a slogan worth adopting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fair trade cannot take place without the relevant infrastructure, and without agreements such as those reached in the framework of the WTO for example. Relevant guidelines applicable to the entire producer-consumer chain must be developed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It must be borne in mind that aiding trade also involves supporting our own threatened sectors such as sugar and soft fruit.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, support should be provided for cross-border exchanges between the Union and its neighbours, for example Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the global level, the situation concerning exchanges is so diverse that standardisation is required. All citizens must be informed about these standards too. An aid programme should therefore be developed drawing on Europe’s historical experience and the wealth of Europe’s supply of goods, services and know-how. Funding for this programme should also be made available. Funding need not be on a large scale, but it is essential.</p>
      <p sl="pl">By way of analogy I should like to point out that sound trade can do more than simply raise the standard of living, especially in poor countries, which is the focus of this. Sound trade can also lead to more peaceful solutions to global conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As I conclude, I would like to mention an anecdotal assessment, namely that Ryanair does more towards bringing about a common Europe than certain European institutions, because it brings people closer together. Similarly, ‘Fair and Free Trade’ does more towards bringing about integration and well being for the people of this Earth than dubious political decisions, especially in poor countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Trade is what makes the world go round. Europe should promote the kind of trade described, and it is the Commissioner’s duty to ensure that it does so.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will not have escaped anyone in this Chamber and in the economic and productive world of the European Union that an increase in Aid for Trade may help develop the market in a freer and at the same time fairer and better controlled way.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the EU wishes to remain the world’s top economic power and the area of greatest freedom and least social inequality, while also benefiting from the boost it has always received and continues to receive from Parliament, it must not only help to develop the ability of developing countries to promote foreign trade despite their unfortunately considerable loss of competitiveness on world markets, but it must also increase Aid for Trade in the knowledge that liberalisation and aid are not mutually exclusive initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, the not insignificant sum of EUR 2 billion is still not enough. We have to clarify the Aid for Trade concept itself by taking on board the conclusions of the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force on fundable projects and by integrating development policies and actual trade policies as much as possible, as envisaged in the integrated framework, not least with a view to reducing poverty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said within the European Union about a balanced multilateral system of trade and about enabling developing countries to become involved in trade and benefit as a result.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This concern has not, however, been accompanied by an improvement in the situation of the least developed countries. The opposite is the case. Over the last 40 years the participation of these countries in world trade has almost halved, falling from 1.9% to 1%. It is also the case that powerful large chain stores have caused the demise of small traders and that income has been transferred away from less developed countries. That much is abundantly obvious. These facts indicate clearly that globalisation and liberalisation of trade serves to concentrate capital in stronger countries and to increase poverty in less developed ones.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have noted a new approach to trade by the European Union in recent years. This approach is characterised by a desire to export industrial products at the expense of agricultural ones. It is gradually leading to a loss of food security for the Union in general and for the new Member States in particular. It is therefore essential for the European Union to adopt a new approach to international trade and for work on the implementation of national strategies for trade development to be undertaken.</p>

    <intervention id="2-060" speaker_id="28572" name="Georgios Papastamkos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, no one doubts that aid for trade is a particularly important initiative. It helps to bring about the more complete and effective integration of developing countries, especially the less developed countries, into the multilateral trade system.</p>
      <p sl="el">As we have heard, trade is not a panacea for development. However, it can strengthen the economic and general development of recipient states.</p>
      <p sl="el">The special and differentiated treatment of developing countries within the framework of the WTO is necessary to a degree, especially as regards the less developed countries. It should, nonetheless, be pointed out that their assumption of multilateral commitments and their compliance with WTO rules are an incentive for reform which will turn out to be to the benefit of the developing countries themselves.</p>
      <p sl="el">The gradual opening up of their markets and an outward-looking economic and trade policy help to strengthen their competitiveness, allowing the transfer of technology and know-how.</p>
      <p sl="el">The developing countries do, however, appear to be extremely reticent at multilateral negotiations to heed calls for them to open up their markets. For this reason, aid for trade is of decisive importance in encouraging these countries to respond to new obligations and to apply multilateral trade rules, to mitigate the cost of their adapting to reforms and to integrate trade into their development policies more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="el">It goes without saying that aid for trade must be accompanied by appropriate internal policies in developing countries, so that they maximise the result. The European Union is being called upon to play a leading role in this endeavour, in order to formulate an effective, cohesive and targeted aid for trade agenda.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Mandelson for supporting this initiative and for linking the external aspects of competitiveness with internal initiatives for the benefit of the competitiveness of the European economy, which was the subject of our previous debate.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First I would like to congratulate the Member States and the Commission for making a commitment to increase the funds allocated for assistance to business to two billion euros by the year 2010. This is a serious commitment, and in implementing it a great deal of coordination will be required.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In order to achieve this goal, a common European Union strategy is essential, which will have to set out the ways in which the stated goal is going to be achieved. I also congratulate the Committee on International Trade for its timely report in which the committee presented Parliament's views regarding the complex issue of assistance to business. I support the proposal that the Commission present reports to Parliament twice every year. These reports should assess progress in the EU's granting of assistance to business.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Although the commitments I mentioned were made by various countries according to the traditional definition of assistance to business handed down by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in future there is a need to look more closely at the WTO's conclusions and the suggested widening of this definition to include 'business infrastructure' and 'creative productivity possibilities'; in other words, to do everything possible to ensure that assistance to business is all-encompassing, more flexible and more effective.</p>

    <intervention id="2-062" speaker_id="4345" name="Tokia Saïfi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is today displaying ambitious commitments where development is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome this because there is an urgent need to help developing countries to reduce poverty, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to benefit from sustainable economic growth. Let us therefore hope and pray that these objectives are translated into concrete and effective action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this connection, we can only welcome the commitments made to increase aid for trade. I should like to highlight some points that justify the essential nature of this instrument. This instrument meets, firstly, the requirement for consistency, which must guide the EU’s external actions: by interlinking the various areas of its external action, the European Union corresponds to two principles, those of producing better legislation and of increasing the effectiveness of its aid. This instrument also deals with the reality of the multilateral trade system by helping developing countries and the least advanced countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from market access.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, this instrument helps implement trade agreements. One might mention at this point the WTO agreements or the economic partnership agreements. Aid for trade thus helps to make international trade an instrument for reducing poverty through economic development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, if it is to be effective, aid for trade must meet several urgent needs: it must be accompanied by practical commitments, not least those promoting technical assistance; its implementation must be controlled and monitored and it must strengthen local ownership and results-focused management. This is crucial if aid for trade is to enable developing countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from the multilateral trade system and to provide themselves with the means actually to increase their capacities in the trade arena. Let us therefore call on all the parties involved not to relax their efforts, so that aid for trade is able to keep its promises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome and commend all those who have spoken on this subject this morning. I do not find myself in disagreement with anyone who has contributed. I agree, for example, with Mr Papastamkos, who said it is very important that, when we are pursuing trade and reform policies of our own, we are able to put in place flanking measures properly supported with adequate funds which enable developing countries to adjust to those reforms too. I agree with Mrs Saïfi that this has to be a results-driven process, which is why I attach importance to proper reporting as part of an effective aid-for-trade monitoring and reporting pillar, both in respect of what we do in the EU and in relation to the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I might, though, just make two responses: first of all, to those who have questioned whether there is any question of double counting, recycling of money, robbing Peter to pay Paul or robbing Paul to pay Peter (which might be preferable!) – in fact neither is happening. Aid for trade, in our view, should never imply less aid for other sectors. The increases in aid for trade for both the Commission and the Member States are less than the overall ODA budget increases. Therefore, there is no need to reallocate resources from other sectors to meet the aid-for-trade pledges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, one or two Members raised the issue of fair trade. In my view, our strategy should confirm full support for any activity which involves the private sector – especially SMEs – and civil society to ensure that aid for trade facilitates the creation and growth of enterprises to compete in international markets, for example, voluntary initiatives such as fair trade, eco-labels and comparable corporate scheme standards. The strategy should also address related issues of labour market and social adjustment and the ILO’s core labour standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last of all, I think that Max van den Berg’s point about rules of origin, their improvement and simplification is very important. It is something on which I have focused and not made, along with my colleagues in the Commission, as much progress to date as I would like to have done, and we need to add speed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I think Mr Schmidt made some important points about aid for trade and its possible impact on local markets, and I shall certainly reflect on those. But I would like to thank David Martin once again for what has been an excellent and welcome report.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on Economic Partnership Agreements (2005/2246(INI)) (A6-0084/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-068" speaker_id="2037" name="Robert Sturdy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a particularly important report. The Commission, including the Commissioner himself, and I have worked very closely on it. This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP, two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development. Idealistic as this may sound, I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and, despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups, they and I, and I am sure the Commission, remain optimistic.</p>
      <p sl="en">EPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration, identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPA-related support. The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want.</p>
      <p sl="en">The January 2008 deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs. Time is running out. Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations. In the event that some regions need more time, I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed. This should be the objective, not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver, although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines. However, I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions which find themselves without an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report makes a number of recommendations: simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin, full duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP, workable safeguards, dispute settlement and monitoring mechanisms with transparent provisions and a real power to act in the event of changes caused by EPAs having a harmful effect on sectors of ACP economies. These are the positive aspects and need to be correctly framed in negotiations. We need to know how these mechanisms will work and to build trust and ensure that Europe will be as keen to help implement these mechanisms as the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have recognised that, if EPAs are to be successfully concluded, there must be more ACP engagement than has been demonstrated throughout these negotiations. Only a true partnership will ensure these agreements are beneficial to all parties. The official EPA review due to be completed last December failed to provide a full and comprehensive report of the status of negotiations. This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that additional resources will be needed to cope with the effects of change ushered in by EPAs. The scaling-up of trade facilitation, technical assistance and support to help ACP producers meet EU standards must be sufficiently extensive to offset losses from tariff revenues and help ACP countries take advantage of market access. In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner. The EU must be accountable for all of its development assistance and, together with the ACP, must set clear goals that boost ACP competitiveness and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">EPAs have an essential role to play as instruments for development and, appropriately designed, they represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations, promote economic diversification and regional integration, and reduce poverty in ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I mentioned in my speech that the EU must be accountable. This is taxpayers’ money, and democratic accountability is of concern to all of us and is essential. We have failed in many respects to help ACP countries; now I believe we have a real chance to do something that will really make a mark, provided we have the goodwill of all of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately I have to leave now to go back for personal reasons. I have worked very closely with the Commission and the Commissioner. I think we have had a very good understanding and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. I hope that we can continue to work in that manner.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-069" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I regard this report as very constructive, very realistic and very welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said earlier this year in the Committee on International Trade, Mr Sturdy’s is a contribution which helps us look afresh at the challenges we face in these difficult, time-pressured talks. Yes, the EPA negotiations have moved slowly – more slowly, frankly, than anyone could possibly justify. But at the same time we have to recognise that these agreements are new, innovative and ambitious. When change is involved, people inevitably are uncertain and, therefore, want to tread carefully. We need to balance our need to complete these negotiations on time with our need to respect others’ uncertainties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully agree with the starting point of the report, that appropriately designed EPAs are an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations. In fact, I would say that they are our only real opportunity to stop the further slide of ACP trade into the commodity dependence and decreasing diversification that have typified ACP trade over the last quarter of a century. We looked for alternatives, and there is no shortage of suggestions and ideas. None provides the legally secure trade regime or links to development that EPAs do. None tackles the divisions between ACP countries in trade regimes that prevent regional markets emerging and lock countries into a North/South dependency.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I am pleased that the report recognises the good faith and ambitious approach that we have taken. At the same time it recognises that trade is not the panacea for development. Only domestically driven policy reform built on firm foundations of good governance and an enabling environment for business and investment can secure the economic growth and development which the ACP countries seek. But I also agree that trade is critical to support and build on this reform and, in so doing, deliver inclusive growth and jobs. That is why I am determined that we will take the opportunity that EPAs present to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The development dimension of EPAs is in using market access, not merely granting it. It is investment finance, not merely development aid. This needs new rules fit for a globalised world, and this is why I am so keen that EPAs address issues such as competition policy, public procurement and trade facilitation. But we know our partners’ limits and will work with them to phase in change and to identify regionally specific needs and solutions. No one is talking about immediate overnight change or imposing rules. But we will keep talking. To turn away in the face of challenge would be to neglect our duty to give the ACP the economic future they deserve. We want to secure sustainable development, not unsustainable poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Sturdy report calls for full duty-free, quota-free market access into Europe, and this is what we propose. The Commission’s market access offer was made in April and proposes full access for all products with transitions for sugar and rice to protect the managed markets that the ACP rely on. This delivers on our promises to take the greatest commitments on market access and hand the full flexibility of WTO rules on exclusions and implementation over to the ACP themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Everyone will be aware of the importance the ACP rightly attach to additional development support in this negotiation. This is a point on which Robert Sturdy sets out some very useful proposals. Funding is important. We must help the ACP grasp the new trading opportunities that EPAs will provide. The EPAs will not fail for lack of financial assistance – that I can guarantee. As part of this, we have suggested that EPA regional funds be established by each of the negotiating regions in order to build a tailor-made instrument, in line with international standards but owned and run by the ACP with ease of use. These funds, which would also be available to channel the support of other donors, could include institutional support to ensure that the capacity to implement the EPAs is there: private sector competitiveness – from access to finance to industrial retooling, to improving SPS standards; and helping out financially in those countries which face a fiscal challenge with the lowering of tariff barriers as revenues are shifted from governments to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">So our ambition is clear: to build, through EPAs, a trade and development instrument which galvanises investment flows, internal demand, private sector activity and job creation and, in so doing, builds a sustainable fiscal base for ACP governments to operate, to provide basic services and to determine their own economic future free of WTO waivers, concessions and constraints.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish on a broader political point. There has been criticism, including from Members of this Parliament, of these negotiations, and concerns, particularly from our ACP partners, about the content, in some respects, of the negotiations. But we are now making headway in these negotiations. There is a positive dynamic to the negotiations. We have the real prospect of cementing a deep partnership for development between the EU and the ACP. The consequences of failure would be highly damaging to the EU and to the goal of balanced, dynamic growth in the ACP. That is why I welcome this report and Parliament’s support in delivering these agreements. I would like to express again my appreciation for the argument and the proposals and recommendations contained in it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a preliminary point, I should like to excuse my fellow Member, Mrs Sudre, who has been held up by a meeting with our new Prime Minister of France, Mr Fillon. She would have liked to have spoken on the subject of the particular circumstances of the Union’s outermost regions, which are particularly dear to her heart. I should also like to congratulate my friend, Mr Sturdy, on the scope and quality of his work in this excellent own-initiative report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Union must conclude economic partnership agreements, or EPAs, with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, or the ACP countries. These agreements are designed to strengthen economic growth, regional integration and the fight against poverty in six of the world’s major disadvantaged areas. In line with the spirit of Cotonou, we need constantly to point out that the EPAs must not amount to mere free trade agreements, under the World Trade Organisation, but must represent a genuine partnership, making it possible to develop a new intervention framework that is conducive to the development of the ACP countries’ economies and, therefore, to consolidate peace, not least on the African continent, with a regional integration dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Due to their geographical location, near many ACP countries, the overseas communities, whether they belong to the EU or not, must be at the heart of these preferential and reciprocal agreements. It is imperative that the particular circumstances of the outermost regions and overseas countries and territories be taken into account as part of these negotiations, on the basis of Article 299(2) and (3) of the Treaty. The outermost regions and overseas countries and territories must be involved as far upstream as possible in the negotiations so that market access differentiations can be considered and their respective support arrangements coordinated, for the purposes of integrating them more into their regional environments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is in this connection, ladies and gentlemen, that I encourage you to support the amendments co-signed by Mrs Sudre and Mr Sturdy, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and designed to strike an intelligent balance between the regional integration of these outermost territories and the historical and geopolitical links uniting them with Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Sturdy. Everyone agrees that trade can help fight poverty. Unfortunately, the trade benefits for ACP countries, for which the Cotonou Agreement provides, have little effect in practice; nor, in fact, does the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is all attributable to the deficient trade situation in the developing regions in question, the high, standardised European import requirements and the rules of origin that have, to this day, not been reviewed or tailored to practical situations. It is because of these problems that the ACP countries are not operating within the world economy; if anything, they are moving away from it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For this reason, the debate on the economic partnership agreements should not, in the first instance, be about acquiring free-trade agreements, but rather about concluding development contracts. What should be central in these development contracts is trade development within the own region, including the institutional framework and personal means that are difficult to establish, along with the Millennium Goals. Not until much later can we consider opening the markets for the EU. This is, as we see it, where the problem lies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Everything seems to be geared towards 1 January 2008, which is, of course, logical, because the deadline expires on 1 January, but meanwhile, the flexibility now on offer in the negotiations is, in actual fact, insufficiently tied to development indicators and much more to vague time indications. The idea of 25 years has been floated, although this has not been mentioned explicitly anywhere.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is the Commission prepared to link EU access to the markets in question to a development benchmark, so that we are certain that the local markets over there are ready for this? With regard to the regions that ultimately decide against a European Partnership Agreement (EPA) – and we would like to reiterate the negotiations on this subject enjoy our unqualified support – but if it is decided not to conclude an EPA, is the Commission also prepared to make a point of accepting the alternative of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+)?</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are familiar with the technical discussion, but as we see it, disregarding bananas and sugar – as these have been taken out of the equation in practice, not least by us – this is very much a real alternative to the current trade conditions. If the EU is prepared to commit to a rapid reform of the rules of origin – and this is something which the Commissioner confirmed in a different debate a moment ago – then this could well mean that we can make some headway in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning to the Singapore themes, I think it is wonderful, of course, if regions would like to do something with these at any time. There is nothing wrong with that, although we should not impose anything.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is of the utmost importance to meet the deadline of the EPA negotiations, as I pointed out before. This is why we actually want to focus on development contract thinking, in which respect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has advised that we should give ourselves room during the negotiations and time, content and money, and conclude a negotiation contract in the true sense of the word. If the EPA were to turn out this way, this would be fantastic; if not, it is simply not a good offer. I would also urge you to bring the GSP+ to the negotiating table as a real alternative, and talk about it openly in the debates.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the approach he has taken. Mr Sturdy’s approach in taking the Barbados resolution of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a starting point ensured that this report moved forward from a place of compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a whole, my group was satisfied with the tone and balance of the point, which is why we have not tabled any amendments. However, we remain concerned about a key contradiction within the report and within the conduct of the negotiations themselves: on the one hand, we urge negotiators to intensify efforts to complete the negotiations before the end of this year; yet, on the other hand, we call on the Commission not to exert undue pressure on the ACP countries. Both are accurate statements, but surely there can be nothing more pressing than a ticking clock with no acceptable deal on the table and no apparently suitable alternatives coming forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner is familiar with the difficulties that deadlines present. We are not only dealing with the EPAs negotiations, but in the background we have timetables for regional integration and, of course, the troubled Doha Round. The fact that we do not have a WTO agreement has made these negotiations even harder, as the ACP cannot yet predict what they will get – if anything – out of Doha.</p>
      <p sl="de">Through all this, however, runs the thread of development. To make increased liberalisation a driver of poverty reduction and economic growth, the European Union must integrate its trade and development policies, and nowhere is that more important than with the ACP and EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU is being accused of putting the year deadline before development. To counter such accusations I urge the Commissioner to demonstrate the Commission’s flexibility and commitment to the ACP’s concerns by undertaking a genuine exploration of development-oriented alternatives to the EPAs and, at the very least, if we do not have a workable agreement by the deadline, according to Cotonou we must provide at least equivalent market access to the ACP on 1 January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has the resources to undertake such an exercise. Meanwhile the ACP is struggling on a financial and technical basis. We have already spent a great deal of time discussing the EU’s aid for trade this morning and the two rapporteurs worked closely to ensure that these two reports went hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU’s aid for trade programme is crucial to enabling the least-developed countries in the ACP to maximise on the benefits of increased liberalisation, and the Council has already confirmed that a substantial share of the increased trade-related assistance will be devoted to the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ACP will continue to require substantial development assistance to address their supply-side constraints to trade beyond the next EDF. I would like to see the Commission and the Member States work towards significantly increasing the amount of aid for trade available as demand from ACP States increases through implementation of the EPAs. We must, however, acknowledge the moral difficulties of a major donor sitting across the negotiating table from a key recipient of aid for trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must not manipulate the prospect of aid by linking future development assistance to concessions made by the ACP in EPAs. Aid, by its very definition, can be used as a carrot, but it must under no circumstances be used as a stick if the EPAs are not concluded before the end of the 2007 deadline.</p>
      <p sl="de">Aid for trade works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives between donor and recipient.</p>
      <p sl="de">With the Committee on International Trade and Parliament’s delegation to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Commissioner has a breadth and depth of parliamentarians with the expertise and willingness to engage with him on EPAs. As the clock keeps ticking, I urge the Commissioner to work with them to find a development-oriented solution to EPAs which ultimately fits in with the needs of the ACP.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sturdy’s report on Economic Partnership Agreements provides an accurate account of the current state of affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite strong European Union commitment, the present situation is not good. Cooperation based on agreements that fail to take account of the global market and of the principles laid down by the WTO does not bode well for partnership agreements within the ACP framework.</p>
      <p sl="pl">European Union aid to these countries should aim first and foremost to stimulate production that will not represent competition for EU producers. It must not, therefore, create a conflict of interests. The products concerned may be sold on the European Union’s market on the basis of multi-annual agreements. I could mention mining products and biofuels by way of an example. In addition to humanitarian aid, the main priority for these countries is assistance in job creation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Partnership agreements with ACP countries should be in line with the European Union’s economic strategy. New agreements should be based on principles laid down by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the ACP.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, negotiations are now entering upon a crucial stage, and they must not be allowed to fail, but it is also clear from what we are constantly told that the great pressure of time is proving too much for the weaker ones among our partner countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we need a consciously more flexible way of planning trade beyond the first day of January 2008. We should learn from the errors of the Doha round, when there was a date set in stone that was then overshot. Given the intermediate results that have been achieved, it will not be difficult to explain that to the World Trade Organisation. There has been talk here of alternatives such as the extension and further development of GSP+, and that might be one possible way ahead, one for which we have to prepare ourselves, for it must not come as a surprise. We should stop overburdening the negotiations with the rules for investments in the services sector, which makes them all the more difficult and, far from helping us to conclude them speedily, prevents us from concentrating on the essentials.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement negotiations as conducted by the Commission with the backing of the Council are threatening the economic and food sovereignty of the ACP countries and jeopardising any remaining possibility for these countries to consolidate their own productive sectors by increasing the added value of their own production; they are thus leaving them open to the risk of further deindustrialisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The social and environmental impacts of indiscriminately opening up local markets to international investment, which is mainly directed towards natural resources and the produce of the land itself, would exacerbate the lack of any effective economic return for the people of those countries. The only ones to benefit would be the large European multinationals. On chapters such as the so-called Singapore issues, the trade in services and intellectual property rights, we will, moreover, have even stricter rules than those set by the WTO itself. A WTO Plus agreement will push the people of Africa even further into the abyss of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="it">The stability of entire rural communities is at risk in Africa, as are thousands of manufacturing jobs. Without work, there is nothing left for people to do but migrate, trying their luck on those dilapidated boats that have again invaded Europe’s Mediterranean shores in recent days.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are calling for the EPA negotiations as they have been set up to be closed and for a new start to be made on different bases, focusing on social justice, solidarity and the self-development of peoples. In our view it is inconceivable and illogical that, while the Doha Round talks are stuck, the Commission should not want the EPA negotiations to allow for any departure from the negotiating deadline.</p>
      <p sl="it">The whole European Union should instead do all it can within the WTO to gain recognition for a transitional regime, under which a trade preference system benefiting the ACP countries will be maintained until such time as a new agreement is finalised. For all these reasons, and for others that I have no time to mention here, my group has decided to vote against the Sturdy report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. I take the floor also in my capacity as a member of the permanent delegation of the European Union to the ACP countries. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement, and I endorse its main points. Special thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy. This is a very good and extensive report, but it contains 53 detailed points. It almost amounts to negotiating instructions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to highlight the professionalism of the work undertaken, but I am concerned about a certain political aspect that ought to emerge from a European Parliament report. I should like to refer to what I believe to be the five most important points regarding the effect we, the European Parliament, can have on the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, it is essential to clarify the sustainable development aspect of Economic Partnership Agreements. It is not currently all that clear to the countries we are negotiating with.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, it must be understood that opening the market in the framework of the Economic Partnership Agreements, simply opening up the market, does not by itself improve competitiveness. It is very important for our partners in the ACP countries to understand this too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, we should find ways to encourage reforms in those countries, by way of preferences, incentives, and also through scientific and educational aid and personal exchanges. This is all about general civilisational development, which is sometimes even more important than opening the market to products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, we should protect certain specific and sensitive sectors such as agriculture in those countries. We must provide protection for particular social groups. Some of these, for example women, may also be threatened in the framework of individual provisions. Special preferences must be arranged for medicines and health care related issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My fifth and last point is that integration and regional cooperation out there, on the ground, is fundamental. Our European Union also developed primarily on the basis of mutual cooperation and we must emphasise that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation of the economic partnership agreements between the Commission and the ACP countries is giving rise to the deepest concerns among these countries and is taking place in a climate that is incompatible with the historical partnership relationship that unites us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe is perceived as seeking to impose at any price free trade areas on countries that are among the poorest in the world, and under its conditions. The relationship of trust with the ACP countries is now at stake.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must re-open the negotiations on new foundations so as to address the concerns raised in the ACP countries concerning the impact of the EPAs on the future of their economies, many sectors of which could not withstand the lowering of customs protections or a situation in which they face uncontrolled competition with the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission must revert to the principles laid down in the Cotonou Agreement. The aim is development, not reciprocity when it comes to opening up markets. Such a principle would be at odds with the aim set, given the inequalities in development that will not disappear in 20 years’ time. Thus, these countries must have the opportunity to choose between an EPA and another form of preferential agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must offer those who have not signed an EPA by the end of 2007 market access that is at least equal to the preferences from which they benefit now, with none of them having to find themselves back in a more unfavourable situation at the end of the agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, services and the Singapore issues should not be included in the negotiations. The only obligation in terms of compliance with the WTO rules concerns the preferences granted for trade in goods. These issues were taken out of the negotiations within the WTO, at the request of the developing countries. They should not be re-introduced suddenly for the ACP countries. These issues are first and foremost the responsibility of the regional groupings of the ACP countries, whose sovereignty should be respected in this matter. The Commission must therefore withdraw them from the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the parliaments of the ACP countries and the European Parliament, together with civil society, must have access to all the elements of the negotiations and must be consulted and involved as they take place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, if longer deadlines are needed in order to do a proper job of negotiating good economic partnership agreements, then the Commission must demonstrate flexibility and defend the principle of this before the members of the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Sturdy has written a balanced report which also accommodates the fair criticism voiced by the ACP partners to the effect that, during the negotiations, the EU does not listen enough to their complaints and is instead far too ready to impose things unilaterally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to touch upon an aspect that is often overlooked, namely the regional aspect of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA): reinforcing south-south trade. The development goals can only be achieved if the objective of EPAs is to encourage good economic management, promote the regional integration of the ACP economies and attract and hold onto more investments. Timely and effective aid for trade is a conditio sine qua non if the trade potential of the ACP regions is to be increased.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this connection, I would remind the Commission of its President, Mr Barroso’s, pledge to grant the developing countries EUR 1 billion in trade support. The fact that the Council agreement on the forthcoming financial perspectives has made insufficient provision for the proposed EUR 190 million needed annually for countries from the sugar protocol is not a good sign.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After all, keeping one’s promise is a matter of elementary credibility, and it could well determine whether the negotiations succeed or fail.</p>

      <p sl="sv">There are three key concepts that the Commission needs to bear in mind in the negotiations: to listen, not to compel and not to become stressed. We must listen to the ACP countries’ demands.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These negotiations are not conducted on an equal footing. You, Mr Mandelson, have hundreds of experts at your disposal. The ACP countries, for their part, have just a few. We have huge economic power. They have only the beginnings of trade and industry. We can buy up the whole of their trade and industry. They are scarcely able to buy food for the day. When conditions differ so greatly, it is important for us to listen to their demands and to try to meet them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Economic Partnership Agreements must exist to promote their development, not to increase our profits. We must not, therefore, engage in compulsion. If they do not wish to open up a market, we must do as is stated in paragraph 17 of the resolution and not force them to do so. All trade experts educated in neo-liberal thinking believe that reduced tariffs are always a good thing and that free trade is always better than fair trade, but the reality shows that that is not the case. Moreover, it is reality that our negotiating partners inhabit. Mistaken liberalisation can lead to people’s deaths. You can explain what you believe, but allow them to take the decisions. If they are wrong, the mistake is theirs. It is easier to live with deficiencies for which one is oneself responsible and which one can change than to live in extreme poverty imposed by others. Reciprocity is unnecessary. Allow them to decide about it for themselves. We can live with or without reciprocity, but they can die because of it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, we must not become stressed. I therefore hope that the House will delete recital F and approve Amendment 4. Allow the negotiations to take the time required and, in the meantime, allow the General System of Preferences to remain in place. They can then safely continue to sell to us without having a sword of Damocles hanging over them. Together with the ACP countries, we 27 EU countries constitute a dominant group within the World Trade Organisation. If we wish, we can together say that we need to extend the period of the negotiations or else devise alternatives to economic partnership agreements.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the WTO ruled that the customs advantages conferred by the countries of the EU on their former colonies amounted to putting other developing countries at a disadvantage, it was not calling for a new world order.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe, Commissioner, that you are overestimating by far your authority’s competence in matters of planning. The EPA drafts that you have now slapped down on the table in front of the negotiating parties constitute a manifest over-reaching of your negotiating mandate. Treating our own experience in Europe with complete disregard, you seem to want to force through a global patchwork rug of alliances between states founded solely on economic considerations, and so, by not giving your partners even the first chance to find common social and political ground, you are putting European businesses at a massive competitive advantage.</p>
      <p sl="de">I, for one, repudiate the idea of forcing our partner countries to accept conditions of the kind that the radical free-market elements have not managed to get accepted even within the EU. No pretence is made that your regulations for public contracts are anything other than means towards the wedging open of the market; you may be putting two boxers in a ring, but one of them weighs 100 kg more than the other.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to join with those who have congratulated Robert Sturdy on what I think is a good report. The report correctly stresses that these are negotiations that are being conducted between unequal partners and it has been a theme of many of the other contributors this morning. I think the fact that the Commission and the ACP countries perceive the negotiations from a different standpoint is at the heart of many of the problems. If we look at the end of the year deadline, the perception of the Commission is that the deadline is an essential tool for meeting its WTO obligations. From the viewpoint of many of the ACP countries on the other hand, the deadline is being used to rush them into agreeing unsuitable agreements, and the Commission, I think, has to do much more to reassure the ACP countries that the deadline is not and will not be used to browbeat the ACP countries into agreements that they cannot otherwise live with.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the situation with aid, the Commission says, and Commissioner Mandelson repeated this morning, that the negotiations will not fail for lack of money. But it is unfair to expect ACP countries to make long-term decisions on liberalisation and regional integration without having a long-term view of the amount of assistance that would be available to help them put together the regional regulatory frameworks to instigate new methods of collecting government revenues to make up for the loss of the tariff income or to construct a type of infrastructure which we know from our own experience in the EU is so important to developing our regional economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we move on to the issue of market access, I have heard the Commissioner say in this Chamber that the European Union has no offensive trade objectives with ACP countries. But again, when we hear from negotiators, their perception is that the Commission is pushing them very hard to open up our services markets and to make other market-opening offers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say all this in a genuine spirit of belief that the Commission wants a pro-development package with the six regions. The Commission believes it is acting in the interests of the ACP countries, but it must understand that negotiations between unequal partners create suspicion in the weaker partner. When we talk about deadlines, they see threats, when we are vague on the aid package, they see linkage between the amount of market-opening they are prepared to offer and the size of their aid package. If we are to overcome these concerns, then we must bring more openness and transparency to the talks themselves and we must promise that once we conclude the talks, that there will be parliamentary oversight to the finally concluded agreements so that they can be reassured that parliamentarians will be involved in this process from their implementation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, following the progress of the EPA negotiations has been like living in two parallel universes. On the one hand, there have been many statements from the ACP side that the process lacks the development focus it is supposed to have. The ACP countries insist that they are being put under pressure to negotiate on the Commission’s terms and they are particularly concerned that the Commission has failed to give time for proper impact assessments and has dismissed any assessments that were not in line with its own position. On the other hand, strangely, the Commission has maintained throughout that no one is complaining or asking for alternatives to EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the January 2007 review of EPAs by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa was clear. This external and independent review concluded that there was a failure of the negotiations to have a development focus and an excessive focus on trade liberalisation alone. Given this external UN assessment, I do not see how the Commission can keep on maintaining that the EPA negotiations have a positive dynamic and that everything is rosy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I trust that the Commission will take note of the concerns that many– indeed, the vast majority of – Members of Parliament have raised this morning.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EPA negotiations are clearly at a very critical stage, and this week European Union and ACP ministers meet in Brussels to review progress, at a time when, as others have said, they are under intense pressure to conclude by the end of 2007. The reality is, of course, that even where technically they are well prepared, ACP countries still face serious political issues which remain between ACP member states, within governments in the ACP, between governments and private sector, civil society and regional integration organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">David Martin raised some very important points about the level of suspicion and anxiety that exists in ACP countries. In the last few weeks I have been in both west and east Africa and, from the Prime Minister of Senegal, to the President of Ghana, to the Tanzanian Minister of Trade, the message was exactly the same: there are too many unresolved issues. On aid for trade: is it new money? Is it predictable? When is it going to be on the table? On levels of regional integration, in Tanzania I learnt of the enormous problems there and of the new east Africa configuration which they are planning for and have, I think, written to the Commissioner about. Then there are the Singapore issues, which others have mentioned and which are currently causing enormous difficulties in the SADC negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most ACP member states have welcomed duty-free, quota-free access. However, it remains the case – and I am not sure that anyone has mentioned this – that a dozen or more EU Member States are expressing concern and objections to the proposal, and some ACP states are concerned about the impact on sugar, bananas and rice. Only yesterday, Barbados was saying that the region could benefit only if the EU ensured that they build the technical, productive and infrastructural capacity so that they can maximise the opportunities, particularly for sugar, between 2009 and 2015.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is this doomsday scenario that people talk about. That is why, if they cannot sign up by the end of this year, the ACP should be provided with a high level of market access using GSP+.</p>
      <p sl="en">The assertion I hear that alternatives do not exist is simply not the case and neither is the claim that no ACP region or country has asked for them. Recent research by the ODI, the UN and others points to an enhanced GSP as a viable alternative to EPAs and would provide that essential breathing space for negotiations to continue. GSP+ would provide more generous access than GSP, which is clearly not an option. Most ACP countries could well meet the eligibility criteria and would be provided with a level of market access almost equivalent to Cotonou for current exports, with very few exceptions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to express my satisfaction with the way in which this debate has been conducted today in this House. I wish to do so, among other things, because I believe that it blatantly gives the lie to the allegations that we have been hearing regularly over the last few months, to the effect that only a few madmen from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and a civil society defying the European Commission in principle or out of habit are worried about the staging and the outcome of the economic partnership agreement negotiations. That is certainly not the case, as we have heard this morning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To put it simply, there is in fact just one question to be asked today within the context of these negotiations, and that question is as follows: is the Commission able to guarantee the ACP countries that, once signed, the agreements will provide them with development conditions that are more favourable than the ones from which they benefit today? If it is, then I personally no longer have many problems with these economic partnership agreements. If it is not, which I fear, then we have to reject them as they are presented to us at the moment, and for as long as they unduly favour an approach to human relations that is overly concerned with trade, to the exclusion of everything else and to the detriment of the general interest of the peoples of the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Improving the living conditions of as many of our contemporaries and future generations as possible, in the North and in the South, is a priority objective that we are entitled to demand on the part of the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission has a duty to proceed with the negotiations on these agreements, willingly and with all due transparency. In this regard, I refer to the very practical, very correct, remarks made by my colleague, Mr Arif. However, the Commission has a duty also to give itself, and to give our partners, the necessary timescales, as several speakers who have taken the floor before me have said. It is high time for this demand, which is made by millions of European citizens whom we represent in this House, to be considered with a far more serious and respectful approach than is the case today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, we are hearing Members talk extensively and insistently this morning – and we regularly hear such talk in this House – about the economy, the opening up of markets and competitiveness. These words, let us not forget, are words that we must take for what they are, that is to say, concepts and, at best, instruments, whose only value is their possible contribution to satisfying the general interest, the interest of as many people as possible, not a number – even a growing number – of privileged persons, which can take advantage, both in the North and South, of any old agreement concluded with any old party, but a growing number of men, women and children who, together, represent the great majority of the outcasts of our world and who expect a great deal from a relationship with their European partners which, if not generous, is at least balanced.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, in its latest proposals, the European Union is considering extending the ‘everything but arms’ concept to all the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">True, this is an advance that will make it possible to ensure that none of these countries loses out after 2007, but it is not a miracle solution that makes the EPAs development agreements. For them to become development agreements, we need to go much further: we need to provide for a transitional period that is much longer than the 10 or 12 years that are currently being proposed; we need to put an end to agricultural dumping and respect the principle of food sovereignty; we need to offer genuinely special and individual treatment and enable the ACP countries to protect some of their sectors; we need to put a stop to the pressure on the Singapore issues, in order to uphold the right of all States freely to manage their public services; and, finally, we need to involve civil societies and parliaments more.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to respond to this debate on behalf of the Commission because of the importance of this subject: nothing less than future development, alleviation of poverty and opportunities to use the advantages of the international trade system are at stake for the ACP, some of the most poverty-struck countries in the world to whom we owe an absolute obligation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Economic Partnership Agreements are about using trade as a lever for development. We have no intention of forcing ACP countries to make commitments against their will. We are operating with one constraint, however: EPAs need to be WTO-compliant, thus including trade-opening on both sides for trade in goods and trade in services. This of course, and I say this emphatically, does not mean symmetrical trade-opening between the EU and the ACP. Obviously, in market-opening towards its partners, the EU will go much beyond what ACP partners will do for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, in many areas, we are ready to give serious consideration to transition periods and in some cases very long transition periods – up to 25 years – together with substantial financial aid to help these countries implement their commitments so that EPAs genuinely act as a catalyst for policy reforms in ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning market access, recently the General Affairs Council of our Member States reaffirmed the principle of duty-free, quota-free, access to the ACP but with transition periods for a few sensitive products, notably rice and sugar. The same principle applies on bananas but we agreed on additional evaluation, notably to take into account the EU’s outermost regions, and that will happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically, in response to what Mr van den Berg said, we are jointly building with ACP regions asymmetric market access schedules which allow continued protection for ACP-sensitive sectors. Our duty-free, quota-free offer gives great scope to protect the ACP and to open their markets in a deeply asymmetric manner. In addition, flexible safeguards will be in place so that we can take action quickly if problems arise. However, a conditional market access schedule would once again put our trading arrangements in a vulnerable position in the WTO, creating further uncertainty for ACP traders and investors. Introducing such a conditional approach would therefore not be wise from the point of view of the interests of the ACP countries themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some Members have talked about alternatives to EPAs. I can say without any hesitation or qualification whatsoever: there are no better development-friendly or superior development instruments available to us that would exceed the ambition and the potential that Economic Partnership Agreements offer. To offer GSP as some have suggested, when instead we could negotiate good Economic Partnership Agreements, would indeed be nonsense. ACP countries that are not LDCs would end up with worse market access to the European Union than almost any other developing countries in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, some then go on to propose GSP+ as an alternative, by relaxing entry criteria to GSP+ and expanding its coverage. This again is completely unacceptable. GSP+ continues the divisions in trade regime between LDCs and non-LDCs that EPAs are seeking to remove and does not promote the use of market access in the way that EPAs do. The GSP is open to all countries and many would simply take advantage of relaxed GSP+ criteria, exposing the ACP to direct competition while fundamentally undermining the purpose of GSP+, which is using trade preferences to promote signature of accords on human rights and good working practices. So I hope that people will not pursue or entertain the idea of GSP or GSP+ being an acceptable and/or superior alternative to EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The best development option by far is to sign EPAs on time. Any alternative falls short of this. We cannot simply flout WTO rules on the goods trade section of EPAs. If it becomes clear that for any region we are really not going to make it, LDCs get Everything but Arms; for non-LDCs that export bananas in particular, the waiver route is probably not politically viable at all. For others, things depend on progress in negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude by saying that, in contrast to some of those who have spoken here in Parliament this morning, I find the approach of the ACP countries shows considerable realism and understanding of what it is in the ACP’s interests to do. The ACP countries have voluntarily agreed the route map that we are following in negotiating these agreements. It is certainly not in the interests of the ACP for those who present themselves as friends of the ACP to peddle a doomsday scenario, to generate fears and insecurity which can only hold the ACP back from engaging in the negotiations which it is so much in their interest to conclude by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="de">We ought to start by bearing in mind that we have to work at the efficient inclusion of the ACP states in world trade and at equal success in all regional groups, which can happen, inter alia, through trade concessions and technical aid for the producers, so that the losses they sustain through tariff revenues can be compensated for, yet that alone does not give them what they need. What they also need in order to actually benefit from easier access to the market is expert instruction and guidance.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on organic production and labelling of organic products is finally going to be put to the vote today, firstly after referral back to committee, and then after an urgent request to the Council, which, I might add, was unanimously rejected by our Parliament last month. Unfortunately, the new discussions held over the last two months with the Council have not enabled us to progress further on important points. In particular, neither the Commission nor the Council agreed to the dual legal basis that we were demanding. The Council did not go back on its decision to permit, by special derogation, additives and veterinary treatments made from GMOs. Furthermore, certain chemical substances could also be permitted by derogation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With no codecision, we are forced to acknowledge this state of affairs. We do, however, deplore the uncommunicative and offhand attitude of the Council over the last few weeks, in spite of the good will of some Member States. I just as deeply regret the fact that the majority of the groups refused yesterday to postpone the vote until June, given that the Council itself had postponed its meeting on organic farming. I regret that the majority of the groups did not wish to exhaust the means that we have to apply pressure. That being said, the Council did nevertheless take up a number of our amendments in its compromise, and regular consultation of all the actors concerned is part of the overall agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on you now to adopt this report. You can count on my determination, and on that of my fellow Members from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, closely to monitor this matter over the next few months.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have been equipped with yet another instrument fit for combating the trafficking in human beings and their sexual exploitation, in the shape of the Daphne III programme, but the fact of the matter is that, since over 100 000 women in the European Union are victims of people-trafficking and of violence, this sort of programme needs to be properly endowed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very glad to see that the budget has been topped up by 50 million, bringing it to over EUR 114 million, which will enable us to mount information campaigns in the countries from which those women and children originate who are enticed into the European Union, there to become the victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such information campaigns enable us to prevent this by informing women and offering them protection from exploitation.

      <p sl="de">It has to be said, though, that violence against women is more widespread in cultures in which patriarchal power still has deep roots and in which hardly anyone regards it as a problem. Violations of women’s human rights such as genital mutilation and forced marriages are happening among us, too, as a consequence of the waves of immigration over recent years, and I believe we need to do more, in order to address this, than to raise awareness of the problem or make forced marriages punishable in the EU. There must also be no acceptance of exceptional court rulings justified by reference to cultural considerations; when criminals are punished, be they from the host community or from Western cultural backgrounds, the same law must apply to Muslim immigrants. This is where Justice must be neither blind nor dumb.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am voting for the adoption of Mrs Gröner's report on the Council’s common position with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women, and to protect victims and groups at risk (Daphne III programme) as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Daphne programme was set up in 1997. It has served to fund over 350 projects providing support for non-governmental organisations and institutions and associations involved in protecting children, young people and women against violence. I offer my strong support to the third stage of this project, to which Mrs Gröner's report refers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The main aims of Daphne III are supporting the development of the Community's policy relating to public health protection, gender equality, combating domestic violence, protecting children's rights, combating gender violence in situations of conflict and combating human trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These ambitious aims for 2007-2013 will be supported by a budget of EUR 116 850 000. A comparison with the Daphne I budget – EUR 20 000 000 and with the Daphne II budget – EUR 50 000 000 is testament to recognition of the programme’s importance and achievements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The extension of the Daphne programme for 2007-2013 demonstrates the European Parliament’s desire to ensure that this plan, which was implemented in 2000, continues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Violence against children, adolescents and women is a tragic social phenomenon. Some groups that are particularly vulnerable to violence must be better protected, but we must not forget about domestic violence and female genital mutilation. In Réunion, for example, the number of offences against women has doubled in 20 years, and more than a fifth of women have suffered at least one form of violence in a public space during the last 12 months. I would therefore like it if the European Commission devoted a European year to this type of violence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the commitment made by the Commission, which has increased the budget to almost EUR 117 million, even though this amount is lower than the one requested by the European Parliament. The twofold increase in the resources testifies, however, to a real ambition in the objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This effort must still be accompanied by transparency in the programme and must make the programme more accessible to civil society, which lacks technical assistance when it comes to preparing draft proposals, particularly in the outermost regions.

      <p sl="en">Instead of some of the more far-reaching proposals suggested to us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a modest revision of Rule 47 (which would be renamed ‘Procedure with associated committees’). This more modest change would require the chairmen and rapporteurs of the committees concerned to meet and jointly identify areas of the text falling within their executive or joint competences. The chair of the committee responsible would have to take account of any such agreement when ruling on the final responsibility for different parts of the text. The rule would also allow the parties to agree, if they so wish, on more precise arrangements for their cooperation, which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group. The rule change also would guarantee that associated committees are represented in any Parliament delegation in a conciliation procedure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, from a practical point of view, these reports aim at simplifying the work done by this Parliament in its institutional and legal framework. However, they are symptomatic of a parliamentary practice where, ultimately, everything is more or less decided in advance, in small committees, by means of the interinstitutional or intergroup compromise, and in the name of effectiveness and rationality. They are also symptomatic of a parliament in which the ‘large’ groups – at least those that are recognised as such – call the shots and in which the individual rights of Members are reduced to their most basic expression, and are even non-existent when it comes to producing legislation.</p>

Being an Austrian, and thus a citizen of a country with very considerable water reserves, I do believe that a sustainable and environmentally conscious water policy means that we must no longer give financial support to intensive agriculture, which brings in its train such problems as over-fertilisation. Instead, support should go to those farmers who use traditional methods of cultivation.

I feel that the EU should continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the environment. Furthermore, the purpose of this proposal is to protect and promote environmental quality in accordance with the principle of sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This fresh proposal for a directive on environmental quality standards in the area of water policy follows on from the Water Framework Directive, adopted in 2000. The proposal sets out environmental quality targets for surface water to be achieved by 2015, albeit without any formal appraisal of the various existing laws or an integrated approach to water policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is therefore a series of separate measures with some positive aspects. I welcome, for example, reference to the need to take account of the scientific and technical data available, the different environmental conditions in the different regions, balanced economic and social development and the polluter pays principle. Yet this is presented in a framework of fostering neoliberalism, with the proposed measures playing second fiddle to ‘maintaining uniform competitive conditions in the internal market’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It also introduces vague concepts such as ‘best available techniques’, which may be used to make it compulsory to use patented technology and equipment. This will engender dependence, and may serve to deprive workers of production resources given the price of hi-tech equipment.</p>

However, the chemical pollution of surface waters may cause disruptions to water ecosystems, destroying biodiversity, or contaminants may accumulate in the food chain from poisoned fish. Moreover, it is clear that the Commission’s intention is to target and blame agriculture as being the sole factor responsible for the chemical contamination of surface waters. Moreover, the ‘polluter pays’ principle does not stop pollution, but it does legalise the inconsiderate actions of industry and other monopolies.</p>
      <p sl="el">No specific measures are proposed for controlling the sources of the disposal of ‘priority substances’, both dangerous and harmless, the concentration limits of which are dealt with in the proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, the report does expand the limited content of the directive in order to achieve more effective protection of waters.

      <p sl="fr">As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that the threshold for accidental contamination by GMOs should not be the same as in conventional agriculture, that is to say around 0.9%, for one would thereby be making the de facto admission that contamination can no longer be prevented and that it cannot be guaranteed that a product is GMO-free even if certified ‘organic’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I supported the proposal in this regard from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, according to which the presence of GMOs in organic products would have to be limited solely to unforeseeable and technically unavoidable amounts to a maximum of 0.1% and that the term ‘organic’ was not to be used to describe products contaminated accidentally by GMOs in excess of a detectable threshold of 0.1%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I endorse the motion that a different legal basis be found for this matter relating to organic farming.

It proposed a regulation authorising the presence of up to 0.9% of GMOs in organic products, among other points with which we disagree. We still feel that this is unacceptable, particularly as regards organic farming. To tolerate the 0.9% of GMO contamination proposed by the report would mean accepting GMO contamination of organic products. This will undeniably have an impact on consumers, and constitutes a serious, unacceptable threat to the survival of the organic food industry.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Consumers choose to buy organic products because they are produced more sustainably and without pesticides and are completely GMO-free. To accept the introduction of GMOs, even in very small quantities, is tantamount to hoodwinking consumers and will have serious consequences for the environment and for people’s health in general.</p>

To do otherwise is to collude in limiting the availability of products many consumers might choose to purchase.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Organic farming now represents 1.4% of the agricultural production of the 25 Member States and 3.6% of the utilised agricultural area (1.8% of the agricultural land in Brittany). Consumer demand continues to increase, and the arrival on the market of these products, which have all manner of labels and which are produced even outside the EU, presents new problems where control, certification and labelling are concerned. Furthermore, the subsidies and standards in this area are very disparate from one country to the next, and this creates distortions of competition for those organic producers who receive the least assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore welcome the adoption in plenary of the opinion of the European Parliament addressed to the Council calling on it swiftly to adopt the regulation on organic farming. This new regulation must make it possible to clarify the Community framework relating to organic food production, which dates back to 1991. Parliament requests that the national inspection systems be strengthened so that products can be traced at every stage of production. If it is compulsory to use the European logo (for foodstuffs containing 95% organic ingredients) and the ‘EU-organic’ indication, then it must remain possible to add other private logos. Finally, the use of GMOs must be prohibited in organic farming.</p>

      <p sl="el">The much-vaunted upgrading of agricultural production and improvements to agricultural products through organic farming risk turning into a colossal scam at the expense of producers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">The few multinationals trying to control the global food chain through modified organisms for the sake of their profits have won through and all the political groups of the EU, including PASOK and New Democracy, are to blame.</p>
      <p sl="el">The admissible presence of GMOs and the addition of supplements (vitamins etc.) from GMOs to organic foods are the back door for using modified organisms in countries and areas resisting their use, which they recognise as dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="el">Setting a limit for admissible levels of modified organisms in organic products, however low it may be today, means it can be increased without control, given that even the European Parliament was not allowed the right of codecision. This limit will now be set by the multinationals in line with the natural contamination which will be caused by the permitted coexistence of conventional, genetically modified and organic crops, however many protective measures are taken.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thus organic farmers will see their products downgraded, while consumers buying ‘organic’ products with GMOs will be deceived.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 is something that should be supported as a matter of principle. Appropriate measures are therefore required. Species and ecosystems need space to develop and recover. Accordingly, the maintenance of ecosystems should become a fundamental goal of all EU horizontal and sectoral policies. Healthy ecosystems play a vital role in prosperity and well-being in the EU and worldwide. If urban and rural development goes on overlooking nature, our landscape will be dominated by cement and pollution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that biodiversity is a cornerstone of sustainable development, biodiversity concerns need to be integrated into all areas of policy-making.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although there are contradictions in Community policy, the Member States must take up all available opportunities under the CAP, the CFP, cohesion and structural funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme to support biodiversity targets. Furthermore, it is imperative that greater consideration be given to financial needs in the 2008-09 Community budget review, during which there should be an assessment of the sufficiency (or otherwise) and availability of EU financing for biodiversity, especially for Natura 2000.</p>

It does not refer to the huge threat from resistant, genetically-modified plants which shrink plant biodiversity and harbour dangers to public health.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is already a plethora of data about the mass disappearance of species; the rates of loss are 100-1000 times higher than natural levels, with tragic consequences for the genetic flow between populations of flora and fauna.</p>

These, however, are the result of the plundering exploitation of nature by the monopolies for the sake of their profits.

For this to be beneficial to everyone, however, a process that involves not only negotiation but also adjustment, including educational and information activities for interested social groups must precede opening.

Setting standards and conditions to be met by the interested parties is particularly important. These include environmental standards, conditions relating to work and pay, and the principles of innovation. A so-called road map should be drawn up for this process, laying down the various stages and allowing for development. Full monitoring by the interested parties should also be arranged.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I do not know what Mr Sarkozy has been doing over the last five years, but he has certainly not been reading the reports by this Parliament, or the records of the Council or the speeches by Mr Mandelson and his predecessor. They never mention ‘preference’, except when it comes to encouraging an even greater liberalisation of our markets. They never mention protection, even though the EU’s trade defence instruments are manifestly inadequate and randomly used. They mention only the pursuit of globalisation and risk management.

They ‘should be WTO-compatible, comprehensive, ambitious’ and should ensure far-reaching liberalisation of services and investment, going beyond both existing multilateral commitments and those expected to result from a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda’. In other words, with the WTO negotiations deadlocked, the order has come to press ahead whenever and wherever possible with the liberalisation of trade, to the delight and the profit of the large economic and financial groups in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">The introduction at Committee stage of paragraphs on the need for Core Labour and Environmental Standards to be integrated into the EU’s trade deals, and of additional references to development considerations, made the report more rounded.

      <p sl="unknown">It is with great pleasure that I welcome the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Romano Prodi, to the European Parliament today to discuss with us the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Italy, one of the founding Member States, has always been in the forefront in guiding the process of European integration, and Italy is also playing a decisive role at this moment, when we are seeking a solution to the stalemate reached in the process of European integration – a solution that everyone can accept.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In particular, I should like to thank the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, for the fruitful collaboration that we have established in order to make a success of revising the Treaties. The President of Parliament knows that when he speaks he has not only the support of Parliament, but also that of Italy, and that gives him greater strength.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, my dear Mr Prodi, in Rome, your country’s capital city, there took place in March of this year a series of celebrations in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, when we were able to rejoice in looking back on 50 years of stability, prosperity and progress that our citizens have enjoyed. Now, though, is also the time to look forward into the future together. Today, the European Union faces great challenges and must, in order to master them, summon up the will to take the necessary steps and implement reforms that will guide us along the way to a secure future.</p>
      <p sl="de">You, Mr Prodi, in your time as President of the Commission, played a part in shaping the history of the European Union at an important juncture in time. The Commission under your chairmanship, represented in the Convention by Commissioners Vittorino and Barnier, played an active part in the work on the future of the European Union and watched over the birth of the constitutional treaty right up to the Intergovernmental Conference. The German Presidency of the Council is currently working hard to find a solution satisfactory not only to all those countries that rejected the Treaty, but also to the eighteen Member States, constituting the majority by population of the European Union, that have already ratified it. As this process moves forward, the European Parliament unreservedly endorses the substance of the constitutional treaty, not least because it represents a compromise achieved after lengthy negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">We realise, though, that finding a solution will call for hard work on the part of all of us, and so we strongly support the efforts on the part of the German Presidency of the Council, especially those undertaken by the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, towards a renewed consensus among all 27 Member States. Were our response, however, to end up making the European Union less democratic, to limit its ability to take decisions, and to make it less transparent, that would be to misinterpret what those citizens who, in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, expressed their misgivings, actually wanted, and so this House will not be satisfied with a result that is not in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens. I am persuaded, Prime Minister, that, with goodwill, it is possible not only to draw closer to one another, but also to achieve a result.</p>
      <p sl="it">Prime Minister, the floor is yours.</p>

      <p sl="it">Prime Minister of Italy. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of Europe and of European integration, and it is in that knowledge, and not without emotion, that I address you today. I am most grateful to the President, Hans Gert Poettering, for this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Between now and the 2009 elections, Europe will be playing for its own future. In a month’s time, the European Council will decide on launching an Intergovernmental Conference, at the end of which we must be able to say that we are equal to the commitments that we all adopted together in Berlin on 25 March this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a question of deciding what Europe needs – what we all need – in order to address the challenges that the world imposes on us. This sounds like an abstract issue, but in fact it is highly concrete. We ought to have realised by now that the ability of us Europeans to interpret the globalised world and to take the opportunities it offers depends on how we are able to make our joint institutions operate.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must say straight away that, quite frankly, I do not agree with those who continue to contrast the need to produce results with the need to strengthen Europe’s institutions. It is precisely in order to get more results that I have always hoped and fought for stronger and more effective joint institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">This time we are not starting from scratch. In other words, we do not have to reinvent the wheel. In October 2004, all the European countries signed a treaty and 18 countries have actually ratified it. Over these last two years, it has been the arguments of those who are hesitant that have been heard most of all. The time has now come to listen to those who have ratified the 2004 treaty, those who have worked hard, including with their own citizens, to stay on that path.</p>
      <p sl="it">They had embarked on that path a few years previously at Laeken, where it had unfolded from a fundamental and irrefutable starting point: that Europe could not achieve ambitious results without equally ambitious reforms.</p>
      <p sl="it">Well, I am convinced that that remains a valid point. We must therefore start again from October 2004, putting aside the struggles and pauses for reflection of these last two years and thinking seriously and responsibly about our future and that of our children.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not simply a matter of agreeing on the new rules that we need. There are other equally urgent requirements, without which Europe will be unable to function. These include a budget worthy of the name, and genuine policies for tackling the major challenges that modern life is throwing at us: energy, climate change, the North-South divide, and so on. However, let us start today with the most urgent issue, which is to find a way out of the constitutional stalemate and to reform the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">To be successful in this, we have to hold faith with a principle that lies at the basis of our existence as the European Union, a principle so fundamental that it defines the very ethics of our being together.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is the principle whereby, in furthering European integration, it is essential always to make an effort to understand the arguments of the other side and in some way to take them on board. We have always made this effort, and we shall continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we also expect the other side to be just as understanding. We expect them equally to take on board our aspirations, which in this case, as you all know very well, are to work towards ever closer union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Bearing this principle in mind, we shall make every effort to help the German and Portuguese Presidencies to preserve as much as possible of our ambition for union, while also taking the other side’s arguments into account as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having established that, I must now say what in my view we cannot allow the June European Council and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference to do.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, we must remember that, this time, keeping to the timetable is directly associated with a question of democracy. In 2009, Europe’s voters will need to know what kind of Europe they are being asked to vote on. What role will the European Parliament have? What will its duties be? Will there be a stable Council Presidency, and a European Foreign Minister? How will the Commission be formed? And so forth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Intergovernmental Conference therefore needs to be given a precise and selective mandate, with a clear indication of the few significant sticking points for negotiation and, above all, how to resolve them. Only by doing that will we succeed in honouring our promise to formulate the new rules by 2009.</p>
      <p sl="it">If it were given an open mandate, the Conference would be unlikely to reach a conclusion by the end of 2007, and the time needed to process the new agreement at national level would mean that the process could not be completed by early 2009. In short, it would automatically result in an impasse.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me to make an observation at this point. This is something that suddenly occurred to me the other day after rereading the 2004 Constitutional Treaty – I would ask you all to have another look at it, now that some time has passed and it is possible to be more objective.</p>
      <p sl="it">Well, the document produced in 2004 is good, really good, and it has a broad, Europe-wide reach. Above all, its first part puts across in a clear and intelligible manner the meaning and the vision of the great common enterprise on which we have embarked.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should therefore think twice before we shelve it and set off down the path of plugging new elements into the existing treaties, whether wholly or in part. We would also be throwing out all its existing simplicity and legibility, at the cost of the people's understanding and, hence, of their support for the European project.</p>
      <p sl="it">Most of all, however, we would be throwing out a text that provides a consistent view of Europe, a text that is able to combine the ideals held by many of us with the practical need, which everyone recognises, to endow our Union with more solid rules and sufficient resources to meet its new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="it">The way the negotiations have gone so far makes me think that, unfortunately, we shall have to meddle with the 2004 text again. Yet I would like to put it on record in front of you all here today that I am convinced that in doing so we will be depriving ourselves of something very important. For those of us who believe in the European project, that would be an enormous sacrifice, and a very high price to pay for all those who have ratified it and made a democratic investment in doing so. We need to remember that.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why we cannot accept any disfigurement of the existing institutional package. Strengthening our common foreign and security policy by appointing a foreign minister, having a stable Council Presidency, extending qualified majority voting, overturning the three-pillar structure, and providing the Union with a legal personality are all, for us, essential points that need to be safeguarded.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like here to warn against certain appeals for ‘realism’, which are typical on the eve of a major European Council and unfailingly seek to achieve a watered-down compromise. I would point out, however, that if the major global challenges can only be addressed at a European level, then the people who want a Europe that is equal to such challenges are the ones who are being genuinely realistic, and not the people who do not want that.</p>
      <p sl="it">Internally, I would mention upholding the European social model and creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice. How can anyone fail to see that this is a vital complement for a European citizenship that identifies with more than just the economic dimension?</p>
      <p sl="it">Externally, I would mention wars, the fight against international terrorism, and the global challenges of energy and climate change (hydrogen). How can anyone deny that the only way to make our choices and our values prevail on the international stage is by being able to express a foreign policy worthy of the name and communicating it to the world with one voice?</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the structure of the European Union, you must not believe that it is merely a theoretical issue. The complexity of the Union is one of the main reasons for the gap between it and the people. How can anyone not see the advantages, then, of overturning the pillar structure, especially in terms of clarity and understanding on the part of the people?</p>
      <p sl="it">The 2004 Constitutional Treaty provides convincing solutions for these points. Do we really want to sacrifice them for the sake of a watered-down approach that resorts to the lowest common denominator? Do we really want to risk making the system even more complex by refusing to make in-depth changes and confining ourselves to merely touching it up here and there? Do we really want to continue proceeding ‘with our face masked’, to use Jacques Delors’ expression, for fear of revealing the real Europe to our citizens?</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, my dear Members of this Parliament, representatives of Europe’s citizens, let us try not to lend support to the negative rhetoric on Europe. Let us not go on concealing it from our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us show them this Europe, instead, and show it proudly. Let everyone see what it has done for us in terms of peace and prosperity; let us explain how vital it is for our lives. Let us tell our fellow citizens once and for all that in a world that is now a system of continents it makes no sense for a country and its citizens to live outside a political and economic aggregation that is internally strong and externally respected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy will therefore make every effort in these negotiations to secure a worthy compromise. I am convinced that we can succeed and that, all together, we must succeed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, if it proves impossible for all 27 countries to agree, then there will be the problem of how to proceed. That dilemma can only be resolved if we go back to that fundamental principle that I mentioned at the beginning of my address: the very ethics of the Union require that nobody should block other people’s aspirations too much or for too long.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why Italy, a country that has always believed deeply in Europe, realises that it now has a further duty: it must imagine – or start imagining – how to enable countries that are willing to do so to make real progress in furthering European unity.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not think that all countries necessarily have to proceed together at the same speed. I hope they will, and I shall try to make that happen. I realise, however, that it is not always possible. Even now, though, some of Europe’s most significant political decisions, such as the euro and the creation of the Schengen area, have been put into practice by just some of the Member States. They have not been aimed against any State; they have not excluded the others; instead, the door has been left open. Furthermore, these decisions have been respected by those that at the time did not feel ready to move in a certain direction right away.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore hope that this same constructive approach will also hold good in future and that it will prevail over any attempt to use a veto.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy, as you well know, has always thought that being pro-European is the best way to be far-sighted.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, being far-sighted does not only mean drawing up ambitious plans for the future of European integration. It also means addressing the issue of allowing those peoples who want to do so to realise their ambitions of union at the pace and in the manner that are best suited to them.</p>
      <p sl="it">If nobody ever takes the trouble to consider such an eventuality, we run the risk that the European project will run aground and that the ideals of all those who over the years have believed passionately in it will be frustrated. Even countries like mine, which have invested unreservedly in the integration of Europe for 50 years, might eventually run out of enthusiasm.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore want to conclude with a two-fold message.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy will give the German and, later, the Portuguese Presidency the utmost support to ensure that the European Council of 21 and 22 June and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference are a success with which all the Member States can identify.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, Italy is well aware that a compromise is not an end in itself, and that therefore, if we are not convinced by such a compromise, we will not subscribe to it. A fast-track group of countries might then prove to be the best way to advance along the road to an ever closer Union, on condition that the door is always left open to any country that might want to join them at a later date.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me finally to make a strong appeal to the members of our parliaments, the direct representatives of the citizens. Above all, I address the Members of this Parliament, who represent the people of Europe. You have an irreplaceable role in making the citizens understand what is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="it">We will only be able to create the conditions for successful constitutional talks if the work of our governments is supported by your work.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to realise that we must not fail, or the result will be decline: the decline of an advanced idea of Europe, of a Europe that is able to be a leading player in the world thanks to its underlying values. In short, we would risk once again becoming a little western appendage of Asia, a fate to which we would be consigned not only by geography, but also by future history. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a speeding-up of the process of European integration, whether in terms of the relaunch of the institutions, of the new dynamic inspired by Mrs Merkel on climate change and energy or of the implementation of a common immigration policy. Europe is making progress. Europe is demonstrating that it represents a level of decision making that is not just necessary and effective, but also legitimate. Mr Prodi, you have shared with us your vision, your notion of European affairs. Through you, I should like to pay tribute to the historic, and more prevailing than ever, commitment of the Italian people towards European integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After a long period of uncertainty, the relaunch of the institutions is taking shape. The German Presidency is right to make this one of its priorities. If Europe is in a position to make effective and democratic decisions, we will be able usefully to decide on common policies. To move quickly and to enable Europe to make progress were the commitments made by the UMP candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, and such is the mandate given to the new President of the French Republic by the people of France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This dynamic, which is driven by a Member State that rejected the draft Treaty, already has the support of several other EU Member States and must be turned to good account if progress is to be made. The time for asking questions has passed. What we need now is action and flexibility. We are only four weeks away from the crucial European Council of 21 and 22 June, which must result in a new Treaty being drafted by the end of the year. The ratification of the Treaty by the 27 will be able to take place before the 2009 European elections. Action goes hand in hand with flexibility because, as you have said, bridges must be built between the 18 countries that said ‘Yes’, the two that said ‘No’ and those that have not yet given their opinion. Each country will have to make an effort to form links with the others and to educate its public. Success will only come if we stop relying on semantic issues and concentrate on what is truly important: double majority voting, the extension of qualified majority voting, the principle of subsidiarity and the sharing out of powers between the Union and the Member States, a stable presidency, common representation on the international stage and also the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are concerned, what Europe needs is to form a political force and to become an autonomous actor on the international stage. Europe needs an economic and commercial identity so as to ensure that our partners comply with the same rules as us, in the fiscal, environmental and social spheres. Europe must ensure that, even within Europe itself, there is no unfair competition among the Member States, particularly in the area of taxation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the right track; what must prevail is the idea of responsibility and of the general interest on the part of political leaders and of public opinion. While we remain firm in terms of our ideals and principles, they will be well served only if pragmatism prevails over dogmatism and if the good faith is stronger than the bad faith and the lax attitudes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like briefly to mention the recent EU-Russia Summit in Samara. Many commentators regarded the Summit as a failure for Europe. As far as my group is concerned, the opposite is true, and Europe emerged the winner of this Summit. It was the winner, not against Russia – which is a partner whom we respect – but in terms of affirming our convictions and ideals. We are satisfied because, on the Kosovo Status process, on energy and also on the issue of Estonia’s sovereignty, our leaders hoisted the European flag and expressed themselves strongly and intelligibly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Prodi, I shall conclude by saying how essential the Euro-Mediterranean dimension is to our parliamentary group. It is in the Mediterranean that our European adventure will succeed or fail. Nothing is so strategic to us, as Europeans, as investing in our relations with the Mediterranean basin, focusing on the development of a region that is endowed with such considerable human resources, and working towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, Prime Minister Prodi, for that encouraging speech, to which I, as chairman of my group, have nothing further to add, for you have expressed what my group thinks, and we thank you for speaking in such plain terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have no fear of you bringing the same clarity to the negotiations. The reason why we do not fear that prospect is that there will then be at least one strong head of government at the Intergovernmental Conference, one who is not prepared to agree to a compromise at any price, for a compromise that would surrender the substance of what we put into the Constitution would be no compromise at all, but rather a setback for the work of European integration, and so thank you for your clear affirmation.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">My colleague Mr Nyrup Rasmussen had the opportunity to sit at the table in Nice, at which he helped negotiate the Treaty of Nice, and I have had frequent occasion to discuss this with him. When the fifteen Heads of Government who were at Nice left the chamber, they all described the result as inadequate, on the grounds that it was one of those minimal compromises that get reached in order to prevent even more Heads of Government nodding off.</p>
      <p sl="de">That was why the Convention was summoned; it was summoned because those who had sat at the table in Nice said that this was not enough for the purpose of the enlargement that would come about, but it is coming, and, if we want to make a success of it, a new basis will be needed. So it was that they, reluctantly, agreed to our demand for a convention, knowing as they did that what the 15 had hammered out would not be enough for 27. At the Convention, a constitution was adopted, with people saying that the text was OK, and so they would vote for it. It was a good constitution, but it then got thrown out and we were thrown back on the Treaty of Nice. I would ask, though, whether what was true in the year 2000 – namely that Nice would not be enough for enlargement – has become false in 2007. Nice is indeed not enough for the purposes of enlargement, but enlargement has already happened, and on the basis of an inadequate treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is those who seek its destruction who want to leave the European Union in this state, those who want, whatever the cost, to prevent a new Treaty, and there must be no quarter given to them.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">There are those who say that, while Nice may not be enough, it is still too much for them. Today I have heard a Head of Government say that there can be no compromise with people such as they. Those who want to go back to the days before Nice would be best advised to stay away from the Intergovernmental Conference. Now is the time for some straight talking. Eighteen of the Member States of the European Union have already ratified this constitutional treaty, two of them – Spain and Luxembourg – by means of a referendum. Why, in fact, do we put up with a state of affairs in which the only ones that get talked about are France and the Netherlands? Why is it not being said that this Treaty has received the support of two peoples, with, it might be added, more Europeans having cast a ‘yes’ vote for the Constitution than cast a ‘no’ vote against it? That is another truth about European democracy that should be spoken out loud now.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union exemplifies peace at home, social stability, the combination of economic growth and social stability and of the export of values as a basis for policy in the international sphere. There is much in the existing foundational treaties that needs to be changed if this model of success is to survive. In his novel, ‘The Leopard’ the Italian author Tomasi di Lampedusa has Tancredi, the nephew of the Prince of Salina, tell his uncle, in splendid words, that ‘everything must change if everything is to stay as it is’. If Europe wants to remain as successful as it is, it must change the treaties that underpin it, and if you fight like a leopard, then you will find us fighting alongside you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to welcome Mr Prodi back to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed, you have returned Italy to its rightful place at the heart of Europe, and at the heart of the European project. With President Napolitano you have turned the osservato speciale into a partner speciale. Your cabinet, with names like Bonino, Amato and Padoa-Schioppa, fills my colleagues and me with confidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">We hear some criticisms of your first year in government, but we recall the faint hearts who made similarly dismissive remarks about your first year at the Commission. They were proven wrong. Enlargement, the euro: these are the jewels in Europe’s crown, so we will judge a government on its results, not on first appearances. It was Italy which, while others hesitated, led the European Union force into Lebanon, and Italy which pressed for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. You showed the world that Europe can have the vision and the capacity to act in unison for the good of all.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must seize that vision, for Europe’s future strength lies not in insulating itself against injustices, but in confronting the forces of pain and misery and destruction in the world beyond our borders. On our own continent we have healed the hurts of nations. Our interest now, indeed perhaps our survival, depends on exporting in the next 50 years the domestic achievements of the last. Global challenges like climate change, population growth and nuclear proliferation highlight what you have called ‘the inadequacy of unilateralism’. The world needs global mechanisms to create consensus on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">And the model? None is better than our Community method, tried and tested over 50 years. And yet, even as Europe comes of age on the international stage, some are seeking to divide us from within. What should we say to the eurosceptics who say that the European Union is no longer fit for service, or that the European dream is menaced by globalisation, or that integration threatens national identity? They listen, but they do not hear. Mr Prodi, you wisely followed the advice of Cavour, who told us that he had discovered how to deceive diplomats. He said, ‘I tell them the truth, and they never believe me’.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you told us in Berlin, marking Europe’s 50th birthday:</p>
      <p sl="it">‘To create we need common sense, patience, faith, and also a grain of folly.’</p>
      <p sl="it">A grain of folly, of self-belief, as well as grit and determination are indeed needed to face the future. For now is not the time for apathy or egocentrism. Our leaders must be bold: more Europe, not less, is the key to competitiveness; more Europe, not less, is the key to security; more Europe, not less Europe, is the key to a just world. That is why it is vital to reach an institutional settlement at next month’s intergovernmental conference. Only stronger institutions can build a stronger Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Prodi, it was Leonardo da Vinci, your compatriot, who taught us:</p>
      <p sl="it">‘He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind’.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thank you for holding true to your vision.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need to adopt the new treaty. This urgency goes hand in hand with the need to simplify the Union and make it easier for its citizens to understand. To belittle the difficulties that exist and which are the cause of the doubts which have until now prevented us from reaching agreement, however, is certainly not the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Italian Prime Minister, formerly the President of the Commission, must be aware that vague and imprecise proposals lead to vague and inconclusive answers, which is precisely the opposite of what citizens want. This is the philosophy of the possible, that starts out along a thousand paths but does not complete any of them, especially when the paths are the same ones that for over ten years we have seen put forward and then abandoned.</p>
      <p sl="it">The crisis is clear and is not a trivial matter, and we therefore need appropriate solutions ever more quickly. The German Chancellor’s efforts and the statements made by President Sarkozy have therefore given us Europhiles hope once more. We seek to achieve what is feasible, not what is impossible! We believe that compromise, when it is lofty and honourable, forms the foundation of politics. When people say ‘no compromises’ it is because compromises have already been made that are of little importance and little moral value.</p>
      <p sl="it">If there is a clear crisis, then projects that cannot be achieved rapidly should be abandoned and, instead, what can be immediately agreed upon should be consolidated: greater practicality from our institutions; more use made of subsidiarity; a common policy for our borders; terrorism; giving a boost to the economy and competitiveness through completing the infrastructure needed without further indecision, particularly with regard to mobility; a common energy policy; defence of the social contract; clear rules that prevent unfair competition with a stronger position adopted by the Union within the WTO; and harmonisation of criminal legislation on violent crimes against children.</p>
      <p sl="it">Citizens cannot have faith in heads of government who in Strasbourg describe Europe in simple terms and in their own countries do not carry out the projects that Europe has adopted. Strasbourg is calling for a common foreign policy, instead of us all acting solo, as happened in Afghanistan. A lack of security at the borders due to a confused and contradictory policy on immigration lessens the trust of citizens. The first ones to feel the effects of this are legal immigrants. High-speed rail links, which have been approved in all the Community bodies, have been blocked by differences within the Italian Government and likewise growth is at a standstill.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I believe that when people say to us ‘the important role of the MEPs’ we should also try to remember in all countries, including our own, that up until now the members of the European Convention, the Italian members, have never been asked to have an exchange of ideas and to make their contributions. This is also significant. Fewer words and more action!</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to welcome you, Prime Minister Prodi, to this Chamber, partly because, recently, there have unfortunately not been so many speeches of resolute commitment to a top-level solution to the constitutional crisis. We fear, for example, that tomorrow the Dutch Prime Minister will be here singing from a completely different song-book.</p>
      <p sl="it">Understanding the arguments of others is all well and good, but experience teaches us that it is nearly always the arguments of the opposition that win. We know that in the end even the most pro-European governments such as yours gradually yield to the arguments of those who see the true shape of a European Government in the intergovernmental aspect and in the power relations between states. This is what happened in Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. You said that your government would not accept lowest common denominator compromises, and we hope this is true, because very often past examples have not been very edifying.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Greens do not like blackmail, conflict or splits. We would be delighted with a harmonious, innovative and truly sustainable and united Europe, and the 27-member Europe is a major achievement. Let us be clear, however: the blackmail so far has come solely from those wishing to stand in the way of a solution to the constitutional crisis, and this is a fact that we cannot let pass unremarked. Even the majority within this Parliament has in recent months and years refrained from making any proposals of a slightly daring nature, preferring to wait for an initiative from the governments.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe that there are two or three conditions that could permit us, Mr Prodi, to escape from this stalemate and we truly hope that the Italian Government will resolutely agree with us on this issue. There needs to be a strong alliance among the 18 countries that have ratified the Constitution, as well as this Parliament, the Commission and some national parliaments, to resist the trend to dismantle the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">You made a list of some issues and I would like to add at least two more: firstly, the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and secondly, the issue of recasting the revision clause. We can no longer go forward like this, with a treaty that has been adopted unanimously and leaving the European Parliament out.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second condition is that you governments must have the courage to speak to the general public about the choices that must be made and the divisions that exist among you on the future of Europe, and to seek their support. Do not hide yourselves in mysterious secret negotiations. Do not exclude this Parliament from the reform of the European Constitution during the intergovernmental conference that is currently being prepared, not least because experience shows that the winners in secret intergovernmental negotiations are the others.</p>
      <p sl="it">We, and I am finishing now, Mr President, are not afraid of debate on the central issue, even if we do not like it. Indeed, we think that it is only if we face certain governments and certain peoples with a choice of staying in or leaving that they will in the end decide to stand with us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to make three brief comments. The first does not concern Mr Prodi directly, but rather the famous twelve questions put by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the Heads of State or Government. One of them is worded as follows, and I quote: ‘What do you think of the proposal (…) to change the terminology without changing the legal substance, for example, regarding the name of the Treaty?’ How do you expect any citizen, upon reading that, not to say to himself that the European leaders are taking him for a complete fool, to put it mildly?</p>
      <p sl="fr">More fundamentally, Mr Prodi emphasised just now that European electors have to know what the role of the European Parliament will be, if there will or will not be a stable Presidency of the European Council and a European foreign minister, and how the Commission will be constituted. All of these issues are indeed important. But do you not hear other, much stronger and more significant questions being asked around you, questions to which none of you ever reply? For example, even neo-liberal economists are asking where, in the current world context, a policy of unbridled free trade associated with free movement of capital and total freedom to relocate production facilities as well as total freedom of movement for foreign investors, including the most predatory ones, is in danger of leading us to. What changes do you propose to the Community acquis in this regard?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Other voices, and not the least important ones, are being raised against the tax wars that the Member States are waging, or in favour of a change to the statutes of the European Central Bank or yet again in favour of a controlled industrial policy in key sectors of the modern economy, outside the rules of free competition. What kind of break with the status quo do you consider desirable or acceptable from this point of view? Does Europe have to be about the marketplace or about politics in relation to the market? To what extent does democracy end where the reign of the open market economy or free competition begins? These questions are on the table. What do you think about them?</p>
      <p sl="fr">One last word to Mr Barroso, who is not here today, but who expressed his delight at what he considers the victory of the ‘yes’ vote during the French elections. This is a delusion. There is no doubt that the new French President supports the ‘yes’ vote. That is why he, like you, feared a new referendum. But the commitments he had to make on Europe in order to make acceptable his refusal to re-consult the citizens say a lot about the persisting depth of anti-liberal ambitions in that country. We will be able to remind him in particular of the keynote speech he made on this issue on 21 February right here in Strasbourg, entitled ‘I want Europe to change’. The real question is this: other than institutional innovations, what changes are you ready for?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, once again back in this Chamber and in his usual rousing style, Mr Prodi has confirmed his belief in a United States of Europe and the fact that we should speak with one voice on the world stage. Mr Prodi, whilst I may disagree with those views, I have at least to compliment your honesty in saying things in the way that you do. I am surprised you had to time to come, given that in Italy you have had 38 Prime Ministers in the last 60 years and it looks as though you may well be on the verge of the 39th. We are indeed very privileged that you have come along today.</p>
      <p sl="de">When you tell us that security is so important – this ‘drive towards closer cooperation’ as you call it – particularly on the day when the British police announced that charges are to be laid in the case of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was recently murdered in London, I wonder whether we really want your style of justice, given that Mario Scaramella, who tried to warn Mr Litvinenko of what was going to happen to him, has now languished in an Italian jail for six months. The charges against him keep changing and he has not actually faced a court. If you are suggesting we give up common law and habeas corpus for that sort of European system, my answer to you is no, thank you very much indeed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us have a real debate, Mr President. Mr Schulz: 16 countries have approved the European Constitution, not 18, so please can we have some truth, some honesty and some openness and please can we not push on and totally ignore the French and Dutch referendum results. Mr Prodi did not even refer to that in his speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">People have said no. Tens of millions of Europeans are saying ‘Give us, the people, a say in our future’. Stop behaving like a bulldozer, stop sweeping aside public opinion. By all means have your Treaty, but let the people decide on their future. Do not impose it upon them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, the Eurocrats of the Commission and of the Council must have breathed a huge sigh of relief on the evening of 22 April: for them, either Royal or Sarkozy, the UMP or the Socialist Party, were a guarantee that the European Constitution, which had been rejected en masse by two countries in 2005, was going to be put back on track, flying in the face of democracy. Both of them were ideal candidates, and potential Presidents. So was Mr Bayrou.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sarkozy and Royal both gave the impression of believing, like yourselves, that the French only rejected the policies of Brussels, when they also rejected the institutional elements, which are now intended to be reintroduced via the backdoor, namely the single Foreign Minister – the single minister who, had he existed, would have taken us all into the Iraq war – the pseudo-elected President, the Commission reduced to civil servants from certain countries, and the communitisation of all policies, which denies the States any right to veto – in short, the bureaucratic and omnipotent European Superstate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For you, it was better that Sarkozy should have been elected, rather than Royal, since the former wants the Constitution to be ratified by Parliament, while the latter intended to take some account of the popular will.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the appointment of a socialist Minister and a socialist Secretary of State for European affairs, and before there had hardly been time to transfer power from the old to the new President of the Republic, Mr Sarkozy rushed to Berlin to confirm that ratification would be by Parliament, that he was committed to a European Superstate and that he wished to be nothing more than the governor of a European province. The German Chancellor may rest assured: thanks to Mr Sarkozy, her Presidency of Europe will be a success! In June she will be able to present a roadmap relaunching the constitutional process and signing the death warrant for the nations and the sovereignty of the peoples.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Elected as he was by 53% of the French people, Mr Sarkozy is already betraying the aspirations of many of them, namely the 55% of citizens, from the right and from the left, who voted ‘no’ in May 2005.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution was supposed to strengthen the Union as a player on the world stage, but what has actually happened? What appeared was an incomprehensible document, the adoption of which was not an issue for the social engineers who created it. The citizens of two countries have given a resounding ‘no’. The document is also iniquitous, and has for a number of years been diverting the attention of politicians from more pressing problems. It introduces unnecessary conflict within the Union and confirms the suspicion that the Union is a petty concern; not geographically speaking, but in terms of the outlook of its leaders, who are incapable of accepting the failure of this project and of proposing a different one to the public. Heads of State prefer to tiptoe around the subject rather than to admit openly that in Rome three years ago they signed a document which public opinion has since rejected. This is a blind alley and we must find a different way forward.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is not the future of Europe as a global player that will be put in jeopardy by the failure to adopt the Constitution. What does jeopardise it is the remoteness of politicians from real life and the pointless discussions over a dead text. The citizens of the Member States understand less and less the language of the European institutions and their representatives. Our global partners, moreover, will seek to exploit the EU’s lack of unity and the vanity of its leaders.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I firmly believe that the EU needs to reform its institutions and that it needs a new unifying document that would clearly demarcate the scope of authority of the Union and the Member States. We need a Treaty that is concise, comprehensible and fair, and thus acceptable to our citizens, as well as being, most importantly, a Treaty that is something other that just an amended or trimmed down version of the rejected Constitution. I believe that policies on pensions, tax, health, social matters, culture, justice and nuclear energy should remain in the hands of the Member States. Other policy areas must be subject to discussion. Some of us, in both political and normal life, have experienced failure, and this has now happened to the champions of the European Constitution. They should overcome their stubbornness and admit defeat. They should also begin negotiations over a new Treaty at the earliest opportunity. I expect a realistic approach of this kind from the June summit and from the German and Portuguese Presidencies. Only this way will we increase trust in the European project, both among EU citizens and on the wider global economic and political stage.</p>

      <p sl="it">Prime Minister of Italy. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for this debate, which like all debates in this Parliament has been concise, constructive and frank. It has highlighted a huge range of positions regarding the future of the European Union. If we listen to some of the final speakers, some positions are irreconcilable.</p>
      <p sl="it">This problem certainly needs to be tackled, debated and taken forward in an open and democratic way, as always happens and always has happened within this Parliament. It is precisely this fact that prompted me to make my initial speech; it is precisely in order to regulate this great diversity and breadth of opinions that we have to have rules that allow us to run the European Union, as we have all had.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are forgetting the long road travelled in organising the Constitutional Treaty; we are forgetting the 18 months of the Convention, the debates, the involvement of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament. We are forgetting that it was not a closed debate. We arrived, however, at a result; I quote the words of Cristiana Muscardini: ‘but we need to pay attention to the fact that in politics it is necessary to reach a compromise, a lofty compromise’. Well, the draft Constitution was already a compromise!</p>
      <p sl="it">As President of the European Commission, I regretted the fact that some great advances were missing from that treaty. We wanted that compromise, because we realised, with the pragmatism of politics, that one cannot have everything! We realised that our idea of Europe was even stronger, but that, at that time, this was what was permitted by historical circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was signed by all the countries in the Union, including the UK, on the responsibility of the governments of the Union. Now people are saying that the treaty was created in a small room far from the wishes of the people. It was created by the representatives of the people! It was signed by the governments elected by the people! That is what happened! Clearly we can still search for compromise, because throughout our lives we have always sought compromise, but we cannot allow compromise to frustrate and nullify the European project.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is the ultimate limit that we gave ourselves and it is for that reason that I made a speech in which I sketched out the fundamental points which we cannot abandon: they are the will of the people, the issue of the pillars and the issue of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. How can it be that we are ashamed of calling the person who represents us the Minister of Foreign Affairs? Call this person the Secretary of State, if you wish, using the English terminology. What are we afraid of? Do we not realise how much not having a Minister of Foreign Affairs has cost us over the years? Do we not realise what we have been unable to do in the Middle East and all the neighbouring areas, and how we have let the political situation deteriorate, through our own divisions?</p>
      <p sl="it">Is this the sort of irresponsibility with which we are going to face history? Look, what is going to be at stake in the next few days is this final aspect of our political unity, the ultimate aspect of our ability to represent Europe in the world. If we cannot understand that now, when will we be able to? It is only a couple of years or so ago since I left that seat in the Commission! So, in view of the power relations in the world – China, India, Asia – the problem has been that Europe has not been able to speak to these great peoples and has not been able to speak as an equal to the United States, or to convince it!</p>
      <p sl="it">Is that not enough of a burden on our future? Do we want to continue to count for nothing for another whole generation? That is the question that I put to you ahead of the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Council. I ask no other questions. I put forward Europe’s sense of responsibility to history, to our lives and to those of our children.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of difficulty the initiative by Chancellor Merkel and the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency of the French Republic have offered Europe new hope. Despite further resistance, there is now a real possibility of coming up with a new treaty that enshrines the rules of an institution as totally unique as the European Union. It is clear, unfortunately, that the text resulting from the work that was so well directed by the Italian Presidency under Silvio Berlusconi and which was signed in Rome, can no longer enter into force.</p>
      <p sl="it">If, however, we want Europe to carry out the role it deserves on the international stage, we must save the substance of the treaty. I am thinking of the principle of decisions taken by a majority on certain important issues, of a single voice on foreign policy, and of the duration of the Presidency. Adopting a reduced text would only be a first step forwards. Certainly, in striving for perfection we may lose the opportunity to achieve something that is within our grasp, but it is important to continue along the road we have embarked on and to make a decision before the European elections in 2009. I hope, thinking about tomorrow, that in its new term this Parliament may also have a constitutional role, as suggested by many, among them Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and Mr Brunetta.</p>
      <p sl="it">The 27-member Europe, however, does not only need institutional rules in order to function better. It needs to identify with the values which make up its true basis, the foundation on which to construct a Union that in the future will not dissolve when faced with difficulties. It would be a mistake not to ensure that freedom, solidarity, subsidiarity and the central role of the individual are the cornerstones of the Community institutions. It would be a serious error to renounce our identity, our Judaeo-Christian roots and a social model based on a family composed of father, mother and children.</p>

      <p sl="it">These words were very clear on a crucial point: we must start again from the draft Constitution ratified by the 18 countries, and not from Nice. We need to give a fixed mandate, not an open-ended one, to the Intergovernmental Conference. We cannot dismiss a draft Constitution that has been accepted by the vast majority of citizens and that gives precise answers, not vagueness, Mrs Muscardini! Mr Prodi listed these precise answers in his introduction and in his reply.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. I should like to begin by saying how delighted I am that Prime Minister Prodi is someone who is not tired of Europe. A philosopher once said that tiredness was the most serious threat to Europe. I should like to recall that when Mr Prodi was President of the European Commission he undertook the difficult task of enlarging the European Union. He saw enlargement through despite the negative views expressed frequently by the media and public opinion or at least by certain sectors of the latter. Mr Prodi succeeded because he believed in the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like this same conviction to underpin current reflection on the future of Europe. There are many in this Chamber who share my view that the European Union is now in need of wise institutional reform. The question arises, however, as to the extent to which the Community method, referred to by Mr Prodi as the mechanism driving Europe forward, is invoked in the activities of the European Council. That is to say, what role does it play in the activities of the government representatives? Mr Prodi was wearing a certain hat at the European Commission, but he has donned a very different one at the European Council. To the outside observer it sometimes appears that national egotism is the one and only criterion used by the Council, not reflection on the basis of categories of common interest.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe this is a particularly important matter. Parliament understands what it means to be a community, and that spirit is also present in the European Commission. What can be done to ensure that the European Council will also be guided by it?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Prodi, I am making my speech on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group which, I would like to remind Mr Prodi, represents the fourth-largest political group in the European Parliament. I would like to re-emphasise something: Europe is very close to our hearts! Mr Fini, the chairman of the party that I represent, was one of those in the Convention who contributed enthusiastically to the current draft Constitution. More generally, we Italians have a long and uninterrupted European tradition, and therefore cannot but support the appeal made a few months ago in this very Chamber by Mr Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic, who called for the Constitution to be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the reasons why this Constitution is necessary is so that we can have a common foreign policy. Mr Prodi, you were right in pointing to the common foreign policy that we so sorely miss, especially at this time of international crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to take the opportunity, on this point, to thank all those throughout the world who are working on peace-keeping missions, particularly in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Palestine, starting with the approximately 8 000 Italians. These are important missions, strongly supported by all the Italian political parties, even though, to be truthful, Mr Prodi, there are some embarrassing exceptions in your governing majority.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to go back to the Constitution, to express a regret and a wish. The regret is that it has not been possible to mention Europe’s Christian roots in the text; the wish is that the goal of swift adoption of the Constitution will be achieved. I am convinced that Italy, as usual, will play its part well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, how often, over recent months, have I asked myself, ‘where is Romano Prodi? Where are the governments who will defend the Constitution?’ Today, Prime Minister, I have found you once more; I have found Romano Prodi on the barricades. I may have found him late in the day, but I have found him all the same. I found him speaking up for consensus, stepping out from the ranks of the governments who, day in and day out, exchange their historic responsibility for Europe for petty cash.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since you, Prime Minister, said that we have to respect the arguments of others, I would like to ask you which others you mean. If you mean the members of the public, including those who voted ‘no’, then I am unperturbed. We know what they want; they want more democracy, more transparency, more social responsibility, a better Europe, a more convincing constitution. Or do you, by ‘others’, mean the governments who misuse the crisis around the ratification process to abuse us with their old demands, their old claims to power, with all the things we, in the Convention, extracted from those who deliberately deflect public dissatisfaction onto Europe in order to retain their power over a Europe without European democracy, without a social dimension, and without a shared role in the world – those whose interest is in the struggles of reactionaries for power, pitting the Europe of the corridors of power against the Europe of citizens?</p>
      <p sl="de">You spoke of our need for compromises, and that, too, throws up a very pertinent question. The compromise that shines out of the twelve questions is compromise as a historic lie about Europe, for what also needs to be done, Prime Minister – and I am particularly grateful to you for making it visible – is to retain not only the substance, but also the spirit of the Constitution. If we decide that laws are no longer to be called laws, but rather regulations, we are denying people the historic legitimacy to which they have a claim, for these things remain, as far as their substance is concerned, laws. Denial of the primacy of European law is false, for it continues to have a subterranean existence and the foreign minister is still what we wanted him to be. No, indeed, the compromise can be neither a bluff nor a lie. It is for the spirit of the Constitution, too, that we have to fight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, almost two years ago to the day, the French ‘no’ vote sentenced the European Constitution to death. This was then confirmed by the Netherlands, and by the United Kingdom, and then by the Czech Republic and Poland. There was also the scant enthusiasm of the only two countries to have said ‘yes’ by referendum, Luxembourg and Spain. In Spain, just 32% of the registered voters supported the text. In short, the constitutional process broke down and then came to a standstill, and we owe that breakdown mainly to France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From that point on, everything became clear to us, the French sovereigntists, on behalf of whom I am speaking in this House: it was France that needed to be circumvented, it was the French who needed to be tricked! And that was done by means of an immense ruse. When it came to the presidential elections, two candidates were pre-selected at the outset, so that, when one of them was elected and newly legitimised, they would say yes where the French wanted to say no. That explains Mr Sarkozy’s outrageous gesture of rushing to see Mrs Merkel on the very day of his inauguration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There must be no doubt about the illegitimacy of this ‘yes’ dragged out of France by means of this presidential manoeuvring. I am well aware that everyone in the silent, bustling little aquarium of the Brussels oligarchies will get together in order to concoct a new text, and that it will certainly not be called a constitution, but an institutional reform, which amounts to the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘no’ supporters are not dead, however. Mr Barroso should be under no illusions, and nor should you, Mr Prodi: sooner or later, France will speak out again, because France, despite all opposition, is attached to its freedoms.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Prodi, you more than anyone are familiar with how the European institutions work. As a former President of the Commission, you are therefore well placed to fathom why the European citizens are increasingly turning their backs on present-day Europe. Bureaucracy, overregulation, no ounce of respect for the principle of subsidiarity, political correctness, no respect for Europe’s Christian heritage, and the obsessive desire to admit Islamic Turkey to the EU have meant that these days, most Europeans equate the European ideal of the founding fathers with an intrusive super state that no longer listens to what the people want.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In recent years, we have seen some striking examples of the deliberate deafness of official Europe. In France and the Netherlands, in democratic referendums, the people said ‘no’ to the European super state. Despite this, the German Presidency simply carries on down the path already chosen. For Angela Merkel, and I am afraid for you as a Member of the European Council, the will of the people does not count. All opinion polls show that whilst the Europeans want to be on friendly terms with the Turks, they do not want a non-European and Islamic country to join our Union. Again, the pre-determined path is simply followed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Do not harbour any illusions, though. This refusal to listen to the needs and complaints of Europeans will backfire at the next opportunity, and official Europe should not come and complain to us if the citizens again vote ‘incorrectly’ at some stage in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off by saying to Mr Prodi that the government of my country brought itself into disrepute last week by refusing, for commercial reasons, to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Belgium. Nobody wants to offend China. It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral. I therefore hope that, within the European Council, you will speak up to focus on the attitude of your government which, although it likes to wax lyrical about human rights, when the chips are down, lets its own economic interests prevail, and also to denounce Belgium in this matter. If Europe is serious about defending human rights, it should also have the courage to denounce the hypocrisy of some Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">You are a politician with a wealth of experience when it comes to both running a country and running the European Commission, where you served as president. I would like to emphasise that for the European Union to succeed in the future, it is essential to adopt a Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome. This anniversary reminds us that much has changed in the intervening years and that there are treaties still in force that need to be amended. The European Community at that time consisted of six countries, and it was primarily an economic grouping. Today, the European Union is made up of 27 Member States, of which 12 are post-communist countries. The shape of the present-day European Union is substantially different from the one it had in 1957.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Treaties, dating back 50 years, are non-transparent, written in complicated language and could even be described as obsolete. It appears essential to adopt a new Constitutional Treaty and new clear rules of the game. It is necessary to realise that the reforms proposed in the Constitutional Treaty, such as legal personality, fundamental human rights embodied in binding provisions, the office of General Prosecutor, reforms of institutions and the legislative process represent changes which can move the European Union forward. It is high time to end the reflection period and inaugurate a period of action.</p>

Even the British Government has said that the EU is able to take decisions based on current treaties, and the period of reflection following the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes should, in my view, have been used to take a long, hard look at the reasons for the rejection of the constitution. Instead, the discussions now seem solely focused on what parts of it can be kept at all costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">As someone who believes in my nation’s membership of the European Union and the potential for good that Europe possesses, I am saddened by this debate. I have always believed there was a need to simplify and make more transparent the decision-making processes and institutions of Europe, as the Laeken Declaration envisaged. The enlargement of the EU may indeed require some amendments to existing treaties or new treaties from time to time, but I cannot accept that this Constitution is required, nor is it desirable at this moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that the British people will demand a referendum on any new treaty that might propose additional powers for the EU, and my party would support that. We will watch with great interest the actions of the British Government in the weeks to come. Mr Blair will attend the Brussels Summit on the very eve of his retirement and he must not commit his successor in his absence. Gordon Brown should insist that he attend the summit alongside Tony Blair and take full responsibility for whatever his Government signs up to.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that this kind of realism will guide Mr Brown’s actions in the difficult times that lie immediately ahead.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is very good to see you, Prime Minister Prodi, in this House, not only, of course, because of your Prime Ministerial position, but also because you are someone who has done a great deal for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Prodi, you spoke about foreign policy, and I am very grateful to you for that. There are many in this House who are currently saying that we need to present a united front in our dealings with Russia. There are others – and there are many of them – who say that we must not be dominated by America. We need a strong Europe. We all agree that India, China and Brazil are getting stronger and stronger, and wonder whether we can secure our interests there. There is the Middle East problem, which we are about to debate, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is already in her seat. How, then, is there to be European input in all these areas when we do not have a common foreign and security policy, and how are we supposed to have one of those if there is not, in future, one person who can, beyond all doubt, deal with all these foreign issues and be responsible for them?</p>
      <p sl="de">It is on this issue in particular, Prime Minister, that I urge you to stand firm. I agree with you entirely that not every treaty is a good one. What we need is one that goes beyond the minimum required and really moves Europe forward. Prime Minister, I wish you all the best.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was a slogan in 1968: ‘Be realistic. Demand the impossible.’ Today we would have to say, ‘Be realistic. Demand what is necessary in order not to sink this European project of which you are all the temporary custodians.’ If in 2009 the European Parliament were to present itself for re-election without a convincing institutional reply, Europe as a whole would be faced with an irreparable crisis of legitimacy, while, in fact, citizens ought to be able today to choose on the basis of a clear model such as you have set out.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament has given its views on this issue on many occasions and it is now the Council’s turn to speak. Prime Minister Prodi knows that today he represents not only his own country but all those Europhiles who have not given up on greater integration.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I would like to remind you of one thing: those who do not agree today should withdraw; the others can go forward freely. Let us remember that Europe was created by a leading group of countries but it is not necessarily true that tomorrow it can be relaunched using the same method.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Prodi comes before us as a former President of the European Commission with an entirely negative balance sheet: enlargement, the euro, China, reform; it looks like the balance sheet of the Industrial Reconstruction Institute! Today, for instance, seeing that you are so enthusiastic about the super-federalist European Constitution, you did not have the courage to talk about the institutional changes in our country. When is there going to be a decision to allow the federalism that the North has been asking for for so long? This is a question of freedom, and also of political consistency!</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Schulz compared you to the Leopard. That sounds like a gaffe but actually his aim was perfect. Only a great Leopard like you could govern with political parties that have the symbol of the hammer and sickle when you have presided over enlargement involving countries which have freed themselves from communism, and you actually manage to govern while representing only a third of our country.</p>
      <p sl="it">Look: from up above, Luigi Sturzo and Alcide De Gasperi are watching us and perhaps feeling ashamed of those representatives in our country who have forgotten the founding fathers’ commitment to a Europe of the people and of the regions, not of lobby groups.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Prodi, our ambition is to continue with European integration. True, we have misfired. By voting ‘no’ to the Constitutional Treaty, many French people believed that they were resisting a liberal Europe and thus hoped that that would help us to move towards a social and ecological Europe. Well, now we know that quite the opposite has happened. The ‘no’s have condemned our institutions to deadlock, and I share Prime Minister Prodi’s view that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe needs a constitution, and the compromise achieved by the Convention must be adopted and improved. So if, by a mini-treaty, as presented by the new French President, we mean the constitutional compromise and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will be a yes, a yes to a Foreign Minister. What weight will that Minister carry, however, Mr Prodi, without a genuine European foreign policy?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, Mr Prodi, the treaty still needs to be improved. If it had to be a third-rate treaty that is ratified on the sly, that would be unacceptable. The future of Europe is a matter for the people of Europe. I therefore say ‘yes’ to a European referendum being held simultaneously in the 27 countries, and why not during the next European elections?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say ‘yes’, so that Europe can tackle the present-day challenges – I am thinking in particular of climate change – that will radically transform our lives. I am convinced that our fellow citizens understand these challenges and will be able to move this tremendous European project forward.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the process of adopting the European Constitution cannot be reduced to a set of amendments to the existing treaties but must contain important social aspects that are at the moment not present. Europe must be able to meet the great challenges which pose a threat to the rights of citizens, the quality of life, health and the very future of its people.</p>
      <p sl="it">Faced with phenomena such as relocations, the scarcity of water resources, the world’s hunger for energy and climate change, individual states are helpless and unable to formulate winning strategies. It is only through action agreed at continental level, or better still at planetary level, that we can hope for success where we cannot afford failure.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is important for Europe to be at the forefront in the world, both from the political point of view, as a benchmark for socially inclusive policies and a policy of acceptance that can be a model for other parts of the world, and in terms of technological choices and future planning, particularly in the sustainable energy sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">Five members of the main political groups present in the European Parliament have signed a written statement on the need for Europe to take a new approach to the economy, based on hydrogen: a real industrial, technological and social revolution that can be sustainable in the long term. You referred to this and I believe that this is one of the examples where Europe can and must play the principal role on the world stage.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, there is no need for a compromise at all costs, but we need to tackle the real problems affecting millions of citizens. Only in this way will the dream of a united Europe be able to speak to the hearts of Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The critics of the European Union very often charge the European Union with being too strong and with intervening in too many things. It is my conviction that exactly the opposite is true. We, who recently joined the European Union, see that a stronger, more effective Europe is needed, a Europe which has at its disposal the tools for fulfilling its tasks. For this purpose we need a common energy policy, a common migration policy, a common struggle against terrorism and harmonisation of environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We need all this in order to defend the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union as well as to gain citizens’ support for all of these goals. Many look upon this constitution as if it were the end in itself. In reality we need to sort things out, and the Constitutional Treaty is in fact nothing but an instrument for realising these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We will be able to regain the support of the citizens of Europe for the constitutional project if Europe is able to achieve these common goals. In order to do so, of course, it is also very important for us openly to recognise Europe’s common roots based on Christianity, and for this to be mentioned in the European constitution. It is important for us to acknowledge Europe’s common values in terms of rights and freedoms, in terms of the defence of minority rights. We need to gain the support of Europe’s citizens for this constitutional treaty, albeit not as a final goal but as an instrument with which we, together, can reach the goals set out fifty years ago.</p>

      <p sl="it">Reforming Europe today means offering this project also to the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean, and affirming, for them too, the individual right to democracy through the accession of democratic states, starting with Turkey, but also with the prospect of Israel, Morocco and others. You spoke of being in the forefront, but for us only a refusal to close the doors of Europe will constitute being in the forefront.</p>
      <p sl="it">To make another point: we propose that whatever reform is to be made be subject to a referendum of the people of Europe as such. I am not speaking of national referendums, but a single referendum placed before the citizens of the European motherland, as against the neo-Gaullist Europe of national motherlands.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, let us welcome an example of how we can, as a Union, be strong when we have faith in ourselves: the tabling of the resolution on the moratorium on capital punishment before the General Assembly taking place at the United Nations. Mr President, beware of the sabotage that some people are still attempting to wreak now. For example, look at the official communication by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and the Council’s departments.

      <p sl="hu">We are facing great challenges! We must delineate an appropriate plan of action for Europe that will determine the framework and policy in which it will operate, and will shape the Europe in which we would like to live and thrive in the future. It is important for us to preserve and pass on to future generations the unity which we have succeeded through sustained effort in achieving over the decades.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I consider it important to preserve the uniqueness and diverse heritage of all 27 members of the European Union, but I must emphasise that there are countless goals which we cannot achieve individually, but only together.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In light of this, it is our duty to set aside our historical injuries and to place our Union on a renewed foundation. Our interest is in a strong European Union, which takes effective action in face of the many challenges which we must meet today, such as terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, climate change and energy policy. For this reason, it is indispensable to have an institutional system that works effectively.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To this end we must reach a consensus, so that we can advance the pursuit of our common cause, since in the absence of a new fundamental treaty (Constitution), the EU can be no more than a declining western extension of the Asian continent. We have the opportunity for a solution, and I hope that we will be able to take advantage of it.</p>

These countries have only just regained their national identities, through historic steps, from the Soviet Union’s great red melting pot, and thus their citizens want to be Europeans in a way that does not endanger their national identity or their newly created democratic institutions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Moreover, for this very reason the Central and Eastern European countries need a strong Europe, since they consider that their further development and the protection of their national interests are most likely to be guaranteed if they are together, within a flexible Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, recent days have seen a disturbing increase in violence in the Middle East, where conflict between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip has cost over 50 people their lives.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also from the Gaza Strip that over 150 Kassam missiles have been fired at Israeli towns over the past week, killing one Israeli woman yesterday evening. Israeli military action has already cost the lives of over 30 Palestinians, and the situation threatens to escalate still further. The cease fire in the Gaza Strip, agreed by the Palestinians and the Israelis in November is becoming visibly more fragile, and the inter-Palestinian reconciliation achieved in Mecca with Saudi help is at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Mecca agreement had its part to play in bringing rule by Hamas alone to an end. Since 18 March, Palestine has been ruled by a new government of national unity, enjoying the support and confidence of 83 out of 86 members of parliament – an overwhelming majority including all those belonging to Hamas and Fatah. There is still, however, broad consensus in the international community to the effect that the Palestinian Government has not yet quite passed its decisive test, in that it, too, does not completely meet the Quartet’s three criteria.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite this, the European Union has maintained its humanitarian aid for the Palestinians. I want to press home the point that the EUR 300 million given by the European Union amounts to more than that given in all previous years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Quartet’s criteria do however, remain the basis on which a decision on any complete normalisation of our relations with the Palestinians will be taken: they require recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist and of the existing agreements between Israel and the PLO, as well as a general renunciation of violence, which, in particular, has to date been significantly lacking. Particularly at the present time, we expect the Palestinian Government to take effective action to end the bombardment and to release the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has also seized the opportunity presented by the end of sole Hamas rule to make a fresh start in Middle East policy, and the foreign ministers have resumed contact with the Cabinet members who accept the Quartet criteria. It follows that President Abbas deserves our full support. The EU is in close contact with Mr Fayyad, the minister of finance, and is helping him establish transparent institutions and machinery in the financial sphere, for we all want to see the country’s financial and economic position improve, and the release by Israel of the customs and tax repayments it has retained – which the European Union has called for on repeated occasions – would help to achieve that.</p>
      <p sl="de">For some months now, the Presidency has been pushing for the revival of the Middle East Quartet and for greater involvement of the Arab partners who take a constructive line. Having enjoyed initial successes, our particular concern is now that the momentum achieved be maintained, and what this means for us is that we have to apply ourselves with still greater dedication to helping to get all interested parties to make a determined contribution to the Middle Eastern peace process.</p>
      <p sl="de">The bilateral meetings between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have as yet yielded no tangible successes, and something must be done about this. There must be marked improvements in access and mobility for the Palestinians, and the Israelis must at last get round to doing what they have undertaken to do. I note a failure on the part of the Palestinians to actually make the renunciation of violence happen, and also a lack of commitment to the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Arab League has reinforced the peace initiative of March 2002, and this has been due primarily to the commitment by the Saudis. The last Council meeting on 14 May saw an initial, and successful, meeting of the Arab League with the European Union, which occurred at our invitation; the League has also had further talks with the Quartet and with Israel as well, and, while this involvement cannot be a substitute for bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace initiative can create a favourable environment for them, although this will require further support by the European Union in particular, and our Presidency is working to bring about another meeting of the Quartet within the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="de">However sceptical we may be, we must not, despite the slowness of the progress made, sink into a state of resignation. Over recent months, the European Union has become more aware of the role into which it has grown. We are willing to do justice to the greater responsibility which consequently devolves upon us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, unfortunately this debate today comes at a very tense moment when the situation in the whole region is deteriorating both in Lebanon and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as in Israel. The events of the last three days in Lebanon, with significant loss of life in such a short time – almost 100 dead – are a startling reminder of the need to work on a regional solution to this conflict. As you know, Javier Solana is in Beirut today at this very difficult moment and we hope that a better situation can be brought about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge our friends in Lebanon, from all the parties and political factions, to act as they have done so far, to call for calm and to refrain from actions which could provoke a major internal conflict. Once again national unity is also at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission noted that all the factions, the majority and the opposition as well as Palestinian organisations, condemned Fatah al-Islam and I hope that all political leaders will continue to give proof of their maturity, that ability to envisage a better future, and will prevent the conflict from again evolving into an intra-Lebanese fight. What is most important now is to find a solution to de-escalate the situation in Tripoli and to avoid the eruption of other hot spots in the rest of the country. The population in the camps also has to be helped. Ambulances and humanitarian convoys must gain access to the camps. In the end we all know that there has to be a regional solution. In the context of this whole situation we can only call on all sides – in Lebanon and in the Palestinian Territory – to refrain from violence and prevent further escalation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I turn now in particular to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Like the President-in-Office, I too am deeply concerned about last week’s interfactional clashes in Gaza which resulted in 55 dead and 280 injured. Regrettably it seems that Gaza is at risk of sliding into civil war. Factions should stop hostilities immediately and reconcile their differences within the national unity government.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also deplore the resumption of the Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza on the Israeli city of Sderot, which yesterday caused the death of an Israeli woman. Israeli-led air strikes in retaliation then caused the death of 35 Palestinians, so this vicious cycle has started again. Therefore it is important that the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians be restored and extended to the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">During my recent meeting with the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister, Ziad Abu Amr, we discussed the fragile situation of the national unity government, especially as concerns security, but also the budget. The first decisions taken by the government seem to point in the right direction. Mr Abu Amr mentioned that his government considers itself the cabinet of President Abbas. This government has a different programme from its predecessor and I felt encouraged after this meeting. I think that it deserves our clear support. President Abbas has requested all our backing, as his political survival may depend on its success. I hope that this very difficult violent situation can be contained.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, Finance Minister Salam Fayad, whom I met after the formation of the government, faces the incredible challenge of repairing the Palestinian public finances after one year of institutional decay and a sharp decrease in revenues. Against all odds he has made considerable progress and the technical conditions for receiving direct funding have almost been put in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Palestinian Authority has three main sources of funding: internal taxes, taxes and customs revenues on imported products, and foreign aid. Internal taxes have dwindled as a result of the economic slowdown. Since last year’s election, Israel has also withheld the taxes and customs revenues on imported products. This is the major cause of the Palestinian Authority’s financial difficulties. Furthermore, foreign aid cannot flow easily as a result of the US-imposed restrictions on financial transactions with the Palestinian Authority Government</p>
      <p sl="en">We are helping to solve these financial problems in three ways. First, our Temporary International Mechanism has become a core source for funding for allowances, fuel costs and core supplies. Since the formation of the national unity government we manage this TIM in close cooperation with Salam Fayad’s Ministry of Finance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the establishment of the TIM last June, we have already transferred over EUR 300 million through this mechanism. I would like to thank Parliament for its support in making more budgetary resources available so that the TIM can continue to deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second way in which we are helping is to work with our US partners to facilitate the transfer of foreign aid to the Palestinians, in particular the Arab funds pledged in Riyadh at the recent Arab summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, we have urged Israel on multiple occasions to resume the transfer of Palestinian tax and customs revenues. We are using all the instruments we have, whether economic or political, but the survival of this government does not depend only on us. Only the resumption of all financial flows to the Palestinian Authority can deliver a durable solution to their financial crisis. And the Palestinians have to play their role and decide once and for all to end their fighting and focus on peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">We still think that, despite the distress we are witnessing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon, we should profit from an important window of opportunity in the peace process in case it shuts down again, so it is very important that the German initiative is successful. It is crucial that the Arab League relaunches its Peace Initiative. As you know, there has been a determined diplomatic follow-up at the highest level in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. I myself have had several meetings with the Follow-Up Committee in Sharm el Sheikh, in Riyadh, and also more recently at the GAERC meeting in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secretary-General Amr Moussa and others have underlined the urgency which is more evident than ever today and he has asked for our help in bringing the parties to the table. On the Israeli side, I am encouraged that Foreign Minister Livni has been to Cairo and is now expecting a follow-up visit by her Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts in the coming weeks. She has also shown willingness to engage more than in the past and she will also be invited by the German Presidency to the next GAERC meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time I also endorse the efforts of Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to bring the parties together and start discussing the political horizon for the Palestinians. I hope that will be possible even though events are not going well at this moment. The energy and efforts invested by Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others must also be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next week the Quartet will meet. I hope that this meeting will respond to the efforts of the Arab League, which could relaunch the progress on all tracks of the peace process, but I am also realistic and I understand what the German Presidency has said, that we should at least uphold the situation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, we are facing an extremely difficult situation. As the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner have stressed, this is a serious political crisis, with internal confrontations and battles between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, in which so many hopes had been placed; an extremely serious economic, social and humanitarian crisis, and the figures are devastating: more than 66% of the Palestinian population below the poverty line; more than 50% with no food safety; more than one million people unable to receive a stable income for the last year; a hundred dead over the last three days in Lebanon; huge numbers of dead in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that, faced with this situation, the European Union must emerge from its lethargy and take a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">If one thing is being done right, then credit for that must be given to the European Commission, which, amidst countless difficulties, is making its contribution to the humanitarian and social disaster befalling the region, but I believe we must go further.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commissioner has reminded us that the High Representative, Javier Solana, is currently in the region. We must have the courage and strength to try to move beyond fine words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and the European Union must try to bring a little common sense to this barbaric situation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a vicious circle of violence; Kassam missiles are fired, there are Israeli reprisals and suicide attacks are announced … We are facing a totally suicidal spiral of violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must try to impose a little order, we must put faith in the efforts of the High Representative, mobilise the European Union’s diplomatic forces as much as possible, and the Commission must back all of the economic and humanitarian assistance that is being provided.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to draw the attention of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to an issue that I believe to be crucial; that in order to restore direct aid to the Palestinian National Authority, the Quartet stated that not only was the composition of the government decisive, but also the actions that the government was carrying out.</p>
      <p sl="es">Could the Presidency-in-Office of the Council explain its views in this regard and tell us how we can escape from this vicious circle of hate, violence and destruction?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, death and violence have returned to Gaza, Lebanon and Israel. As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we stress the urgent need for a substantive change in the European Union’s policy in the Middle East, with full restoration of financial aid to the Palestinian institutions and people.</p>
      <p sl="it">The conflicts of recent days are the product of exasperation and the stalemate in the political situation, as well as demonstrating and confirming the fact that Israel will not build its own security on the death of Palestine and Palestinians. European democracy’s double standards towards the government of national unity must cease, as the political continuity of that government is the only hope for regaining control of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The decision, however, to suspend financial aid to the institutions seems even more absurd since the formation of the government of national unity. The fact that the Council and the Commission have decided not to meet ministerial representatives of Hamas and the independents does nothing for the stability of that executive body, which is currently the only form of political expression open to the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Mecca agreement, even if it is not an uncritical repetition of the Quartet’s four points, is obviously a step in the right direction, in the sense of mutual recognition and the cessation of violence. On this basis we must work to ensure that the situation develops in a positive direction. Another reason is, as the Commissioner pointed out, that Abu Amr, the Foreign Affairs Minister, who last week was here with us in Brussels, gave us an enormous amount of reassurance on this aspect.</p>
      <p sl="it">We join with the grief and condemnation over the launch of missiles on Sderot and also the fact that people were killed and injured there, but at the same time we wish to call upon the Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cease disproportionate, excessive and illegal retaliation against Palestinian political and civilian figures. A perverse dynamic has been set back in motion and we Europeans must try to help stop it.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to remind you that the 78 people who died within a few days in Lebanon speak volumes about another poisoned fruit of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is the fact that in Lebanon open conflict may break out again with the 400 000 Palestinian refugees present in that country. We have already experienced that nightmare, so let us seek to prevent it, just as last July we put a stop to the war and Israel’s aggression towards Lebanon.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the President-in-Office said that the new unity government in Palestine had not quite passed the litmus test. Well, the Israelis have not quite stopped building their security wall, stealing Palestinian land and water. The Israelis have not quite released the 10 000 prisoners, many of them held without charge or trial. The Israelis have not quite stopped holding checkpoints – 589 according to the Commission’s latest figures – which impose an economic embargo upon the Palestinians. The Israelis have not quite paid back the money – which may amount to about one thousand million euros now – that they have withheld from the Palestinians’ own revenue over the past year. They have not quite stopped the partition and separation by way of identity cards, which my own party leader, Paddy Ashdown – our former representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina – described just last Saturday as racism dressed up as administration.</p>
      <p sl="de">I say these things to the President-in-Office because we are seen as a European Union that practises double standards: we are seen to ignore every Israeli illegality, but to expect Palestinians to behave like saints. When the Commissioner says that we are using all the instruments at our disposal to get the Israelis to observe international agreements and obey the law, I do not think that can possibly be the case. There are many tools at our disposal that we are not even trying to exercise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, what does the Palestinian unity government have to do now? Just two weeks ago our delegation heard Prime Minister Haniyeh not only convince us in a way that satisfied us all that the unity government was determined to meet the Quartet’s three principles, and believed it was doing so, but also that it would meet with members of the Quartet without reservation or precondition at any time to try to sort out these differences. I urge the President-in-Office to take up that offer.</p>
      <p sl="de">Note also the comments just yesterday of the Norwegian Foreign Minister when he asked what would happen if we do not support this government. There would be only chaos and crisis if we do not give it our support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, President-in-Office, the good news in your speech is that you are seeking an urgent meeting to review the situation yet again. That is a positive step forward. All I can say is that we have often accused the Palestinians of missing opportunities; we have often accused the Israelis of missing opportunities. This is an opportunity that we ourselves must not miss.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East poses a significant and ongoing challenge not only for the countries of the region, but also for the wider world. We warn against a partisan emotional approach to this decades-old conflict. Despite all the simplification and the temptation to make facile assessments on the basis of television news clips, this is not a black or white situation. It may be fashionable in certain circles to label Israel as the aggressor and the oppressor, but this belief is untrue and unsound.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The spread of radical attitudes and the votes cast for radical Hamas-style groups indicate the almost non-existent possibilities for dialogue in this area. Another major difficulty that is not often mentioned is the deep divisions and bitter infighting leading to armed conflict within the Palestinian political class and Palestinian society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Certain experts have drawn attention to the Palestinian Authority’s education system. As stated by those who attended the conference organised last week by Mr Van Orden at the European Parliament, the system reinforces negative and antagonistic stereotypes relating the Jihad Holy War and structural opposition to Israel and actual hatred of that country. In the interests of objectivity, it has to be said also that since Hamas’ victory in the elections held in the Palestinian Authority, Israel has been implementing a rather controversial plan whereby it is refusing to transfer Palestinian tax revenue to the Authority. This must have a serious impact on relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The European Union should react in a realistic and rational fashion. It must not behave like a short sighted benevolent uncle handing out large amounts of pocket money but failing to ascertain the use to which it is being put. The Union must not become a hostage to any of the parties to the conflict either.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have to say I am still in a bit of a state of shock over the words of the representative of the Council. I do not understand how he can say that the new unity government does not fulfil the criteria of the Quartet. Our delegation has just come back from the region and all of us unanimously agreed that they had.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, there are still some Qassam rockets which of course are to be condemned. But do you really think that, by refusing to fully engage with the government, the EU is helping bring that back under control? Do you really think it has got nothing to do with the economic and political stranglehold in which Israel holds Gaza?</p>
      <p sl="en">You mention the detention of soldier Shalit – and of course he should be released – but you did not even mention the 41 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who are still detained by Israel; you did not even mention the detention of 10 000 Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel, many without trial. So, let us have some balance in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">By refusing to fully recognise the new unity government and by channelling aid via a temporary international mechanism rather than through the Palestinian Authority, the EU is actively undermining the authority and the apparatus of Palestine’s democratic institutions. And, even worse than that, our position is actually encouraging those elements both inside and outside Palestine which want this government to fail. Every day that goes by when we refuse to engage fully with this government is another day for the extremists to say, ‘Look: democracy is not working. We did everything the international community demanded – democratic elections, a new unity government, fulfilling the Quartet demands, and still we face a political and economic boycott. So, why on earth are we helping to bring about a democratically-elected government which is doing its best to keep the peace?’</p>
      <p sl="en">Is that really what we want? Do not imagine that the alternative will be a slightly different government whose colours we like slightly better. The alternative will be chaos and violence on an unimaginable scale, the whole region will become destabilised and there will be even more rapid growth of extremism across the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because, while the Council adopts a wait-and-see policy to review how the new government performs, each day it waits it puts the very outcome it wants to see in ever greater jeopardy. There is a very real danger that in a few years’ time we will look back at this moment and think, ‘Why on earth did we not support democracy in Palestine when we had the chance?’</p>
      <p sl="en">So to the Council I say please tell us again what the Palestinian Government has to do, and to the Commission I ask, when will you suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement?</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the European Union is not uninvolved in the unspeakable events taking place in Palestine today. That is because it failed to act decisively at the appropriate time and in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="el">Twenty days ago, Parliament’s delegation for our relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council made an official visit to Palestine. Our visit was made at an historic moment in Palestine, following the swearing in of a new government that was the product of free and democratic elections, a government which, even though it had the support of 60% of the electoral body, when it was challenged by the United States and the European Union, did not hesitate to share power with other political forces in order to form a national unity government under the unquestioned leader of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, in faithful obedience to the calls of the Arab League Council.</p>
      <p sl="el">It was to this government, therefore, that represents the entire Palestinian people, that Parliament’s delegation clearly tabled vital issues relating to the question of peace in the Middle East and, as my honourable friends have said, we received clear answers:</p>
      <p sl="el">They told us that they recognise the right of Israel to exist within the 1967 borders. All it has to do is to recognise our right to create our own state next to Israel.</p>
      <p sl="el">They reject violence. They acknowledge all the agreements made between Israel and the PLO. Their immediate priorities include the release of Mr Johnston. They are working to get Saleet released within the framework of an exchange of prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="el">They told us, however, that in order to be able to achieve their goals, they need our help. The political and economic embargo needs to be lifted immediately.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why I conclude with one call to Israel and one call to the Palestinians:</p>
      <p sl="el">Israel should stop targeting missiles at its enemies and free all the elected representatives of the Palestinians;</p>
      <p sl="el">the Palestinians should stop making rocket attacks on Israeli territory.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also call on the Council and the Commission to immediately recognise President Abbas’s new democratically elected national unity government and to put an immediate end to its policy of selectively approaching certain members of that government. Stop the political and economic embargo immediately. Get dynamically involved in a creative dialogue with the entire national unity government. Support this government so that it can negotiate for peace. Otherwise chaos will ensue and the European Union will bear its share of the responsibility for it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, sadly, the situation in Palestine confirms what the sovereigntists have been saying on the subject of the Middle East conflict for a very long time now, namely that it would be wrong to believe that this conflict can be summed up as a straightforward confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis, and even less between Muslims and Jews.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The true division, which is becoming increasingly wide, is between, on the one side, the advocates of conciliation, which not only several Israeli statesmen – and I cannot omit to mention the glorious name of Yitzhak Rabin – but also Palestinian statesmen, such as Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, have shown themselves to be, and, on the other side, the fanatics, both Muslim fanatics and fanatics of the Greater Israel, whose connivances are, moreover, perfectly clear, since we know that Palestinian extremist movements have been backed, and even funded, by certain Israeli radicals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are therefore two camps: on the one hand, the camp that wishes to seek a political solution and, ultimately, peace, and on the other, the camp that seeks confrontation, hate and endless war. Regrettably, despite the fine words, the United States is playing along with the hawks, the Israeli extremists and the Muslim fundamentalists, while Europe, by which I mean the main European States, have remained silent throughout this time. The only European voice that showed any unity was that of the Venice declaration, in June 1980, in which the Europeans stated that they were in favour of the creation of a Palestinian State. Our divisions have increased, however, and Europe can now once again speak with one voice only when it has nothing to say.</p>

Last Wednesday in the Conference of Presidents of our Parliament, I had the honour of attending a meeting with Amr Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League, and the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority. What this made evident to me was their genuine will to work on a peace plan for the region, but a number of things – how shall I put it – structural problems are left pending.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Hamas, the most important Palestinian government party, remains unyielding in its explicit refusal to recognise Israel and still refuses to renounce and condemn terrorism and violence. It is anybody’s guess how the peace talks, in those circumstances, can lead to success.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In fact, in the last few days, the violence between the different Palestinian camps has also flared up, with even a foiled bomb attack on President Mahmoud Abbas. There is no doubt in my mind that Israel has the right to defend itself against violence and terror, by military means if necessary. Israel should be warned, though, against actions directed at Palestinian members of parliament and a fortiori at the Palestinian Prime Minister, although some have voiced an interest in choosing this path, for, were they to do so, they would be crossing a dangerous line, and making a subsequent, and even greater escalation of violence, inevitable.</p>

Today, of course, the usual suspects in this debate, like Mr Davies and Ms Lucas, on their habitual hobbyhorses, have done their biased best to unreasonably shift all the blame onto Israel. What we are witnessing is a veritable civil war in Palestine between Fatah and Hamas, and the particularly aggressive actions of Hamas show us that the pursuit of democracy and a democratic mandate has done nothing to tame or to temper their adherence to terror. It is this undiluted attachment to terror that makes Hamas so unfit to govern. Likewise, their continuing aggression towards Israel, with their sustained rocket campaign, wholly justifies the defensive response of Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear that, as long as Fatah and Hamas can tout both gun and ballot, democracy and the peace that it can bring will not prevail in this troubled and failed entity that is Gaza. Any international initiative that fails to address the removal of the gun from both sides in Palestine will flounder and fail.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, once again we are discussing this tragic situation in Palestine. Let me say at the outset that all of us condemn terrorism wherever it occurs. I should say that the suicide bombers who attacked London a couple of years ago all came from my constituency. However, they were motivated by events in the Middle East – by Iraq and by Palestine – and therefore it is proper that we should not only consider the events in the Middle East as they affect the people there but also people in our own territories.</p>
      <p sl="en">I used to say that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East. But two years ago I chaired our delegation for the elections of President Abbas, which were much welcomed by the international community. However, when he came here a few months ago he said that if we, the international community, would not support him, there would be chaos and civil war in his country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year I chaired the Election Observation Mission for the elections to the parliament in Palestine, and then the European Union turned its back on those results. We seem to be paralysed by the roadmap. However, in my view the situation has now got to the point where the EU simply has to change its approach. Palestine is collapsing economically, politically and socially. We are risking another Algeria, where, when the West turned its back on the results of the elections in 1992, the result was 200 000 dead.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the time has now come for the EU, if it cannot recognise the government of national unity, at least under the terms of a draft resolution some of us discussed last week, it should cooperate comprehensively with that government. Secondly, it is surely high time that the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs had a working party – not just on the United Nations or the Balkans or the five external financing instruments: let us have a working party on the Middle East.</p>

Let us imagine a situation in which State employees have not been paid for a year and a half. Let us imagine hospitals with no drugs and schools with no educational supplies. Let us imagine a sealed-off city, left to its own devices, with no administration in operation. And let us imagine that money is circulating there, and weapons. Remember that one night of power cuts in New York led to looting and crime, in the world's largest democracy. So what can we expect today in Palestine?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our irresponsible policy has led to the collapse of the administrations that we had set up, to the weakening of the power in place, to increased poverty, to the re-emergence of diseases that had disappeared – even the World Bank agrees on this – and this, despite the laudable efforts of the Commission. We have now just climbed a step further into misery: the Palestinians are killing each other! This situation was predictable though, ladies and gentlemen. Rather than seeking unity between the two great Palestinian factions, whose legitimacy was based on fair elections, rather than backing their unity from the outset, we decided to play the game of sanctions, thus dividing them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While President Abbas risked his life and staked everything on ensuring the creation of a government of national unity, based on a political platform inspired by the principles of the Quartet and respecting the peace commitments that had previously been made, we stood by and waited. We have not been able to take advantage of this glint of light and of the hopes raised in Mecca.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, Javier Solana, who is on a visit to the region, has quite rightly stated: ‘We must support Palestinian unity’. But we will not support that unity by sending money and weapons to one of the parties! There is only one way to do that, as you all know: politics. That is why, together with some of my colleagues, I shall say this to you: we must urgently recognise the government of national unity! Its authority must be established, and we must help it to establish that authority and to ensure the subsistence of its population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind: I am not the first person to say that. If we refuse to work with moderate Islamists, however, we will just be stuck with the radicals and the extremists, and it is not just in Palestine that they will make their voices heard!</p>

      <p sl="de">What is evident is that the attempt is again being made to distract attention from the in-fighting between the Palestinians themselves, that is to say between Hamas and Fatah, with fighting in which 55 Palestinians have died, killed by Palestinian hands. It seemed to them that the time was ripe for attention to be diverted to their common foe, Israel, and how did Israel respond? It responded with the mailed fist. This Israeli Government, whose approval ratings lie around the 3% mark, is doing Hamas a favour by trying to wipe out the source of the attacks by military means, leading to more Palestinian victims, whose deaths we lament. Hamas has again won itself time and can put off to another day the political concessions that have to be made. Yet again, we appear to be paralysed. Concessions were, after all, made in Mecca; they may not, to be sure, have been sufficient, but, despite the weaknesses of Mecca, these concessions amounted to a major step in the direction of peace. That agreement has now been stricken to the heart by this resumption of violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do believe, then, that it is for the time being right and proper that the European Union should insist on compliance with all the Quartet’s conditions and with what was agreed at Mecca before it resumes making payments to the unity government. This does not run counter to Mr McMillan-Scott’s call for pragmatic and all-round cooperation to be sought where it really is for the people’s benefit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having said, in our last debate, which followed the Hamas victory, that Europe must never again allow the existence of Israel to be jeopardised, it is with all the greater anguish and sadness that I return from travelling through Palestine. What I mean by that is that, though I wanted to visit Palestine, it was nowhere to be found; what I found instead was a military hinterland, dismembered, divided, a land in which members of families are cut off from one another and from their places of work, in which towns are deprived of water and settlements of fertile land.</p>
      <p sl="de">All I can say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, is that nobody can live under such circumstances. The Israeli Government’s occupation regime is not making the country more secure; it is putting it in jeopardy by turning Palestine into a seedbed of despair, hatred and violence. I can tell you, Commissioner, that the situation has got worse; it will, indeed, get worse still, and nobody can or should be surprised at that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Politicians always find the analysis of military measures difficult, but one fundamental conviction derived from my trip that I would like to share with you is that this occupation regime also serves other purposes: quite obviously, and undeniably, the protection of illegal settlements and the links between them. It also serves to keep the country’s water resources in Israeli hands, to put in place a system of land acquisition whereby Israel’s borders may be set still wider. That cannot be a means to peace.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I said earlier, no longer must anybody put at risk Israel’s right to exist, and so, critical as one may be of it, and whatever demands we might make for the sake of peace in Israel, what I want to say today is that we need to demand that this regime of occupation be abandoned and that help be given in establishing a viable Palestinian state.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Palestinians are continuing to die and so many have already died; again they are being collectively punished. The army’s response is to a group of terrorists, who should indeed be confronted, but once again it is the Palestinian people that is paying.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is our duty and our responsibility to recognise our failure as international communities, political parties and movements: after forty years the Israeli military occupation continues and the wall is stealing water and land from the future Palestinian State. The tragedy that is unfolding has been predicted many times.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since 1980 we have been talking about two peoples and two States: one State exists, but the other does not. The Palestinian people is deprived of freedom, humiliated, expropriated, and hostage to extremist groups that have taken the people and also the leadership hostage. It is not enough! It is really not enough to promise that we will give more economic aid. The solution is a political one: stop the military occupation and the expansion of settlements, recognise the Palestinian Government of national unity, and work to achieve Palestinian unity and not division.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must show that the European Union believes in international legality and says so to Israel, which is continually infringing it. The country is in fact, day by day, as David Grossman says, losing its very morality. We must act quickly! Act quickly, because the Palestinians and Israelis and Lebanese are paying the price of our incapacity and of our double standards. We should recognise the government and also perhaps place an international United Nations force in Gaza and the West Bank. In my view this is vital.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we are still living with the consequences of a mistake made in 1947. If there had been no unilateral recognition of Israel and the state of Palestine had been recognised back then, we would have saved a great deal of bloodshed. One statistics office has concluded that all the blood shed in the area could have saved one million children with blood transfusions.</p>
      <p sl="el">All these tragedies which happened with the twin towers, in London, in Madrid and elsewhere are the result of this policy in 1947, which we are continuing today. Why go into interminable details? Will we have the strength tomorrow to recognise the state of Palestine? That would be some sort of progress.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are blowing the final whistle when the score is 90 – 10. When the umpire blows his final whistle when the score is 50 – 50, he leaves the pitch with his head held high. When he blows his final whistle when the score is 60 – 40, the game is over, but when he blows his final whistle when the score is 90 – 10, all hell breaks out both on the terraces and on the pitch.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore are responsible for this hell, because we blew our final whistle when the score was 90 – 10. The world is going to the dogs and we hear references in Parliament to Iran’s nuclear weapons every day. No one has ever spoken about Israel’s nuclear weapons and that is wrong. If we want to be fair, if we want to believe our citizens and for them to trust us, we must administer justice and there will only be justice with the recognition of the state of Palestine.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, the Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Empire may belong in the past, the world has become globalised, but there is at least one thing that is unchanging, a place where history has come to a standstill, which is Palestine, the Palestine that is becoming mankind’s black hole: Gaza, the camps, rockets, intifadas, attacks, one land for two peoples, a long war that has been going on for sixty years now. It is also a great jungle of myths, with esplanades, tombs, patriarchs, temples, mosques, monotheism and cynicism, a cynicism shared, moreover, by the hardliners on both sides. On the Israeli side, there is technology, force, the elimination of Arafat, of Fatah, economic strangulation, the prisoners, in short, everything, but most definitely not negotiations, Iran over Iraq, Shi’ism over Baathism, and, on the Palestinian side, the hardliners clearly have demographics on their side in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the meantime, three generations have already been sacrificed, and what do we do? Well, we make statements, visits, humanitarian missions – do we not, Mr Solana? That is all! The fact is, this conflict is the descendant of the European conflicts of 1914–1918 and 1939–45, and we are not doing what we should be doing, we are indulging in Pharisaism. We know, however, that we should go further than emergency meetings, that we should stop the embargos, that we should invest, that we need a European Camp David, with all of the parties – not only Israel, Palestine and its government of unity, but also Syria, Iran and Lebanon – and we know that we must state the two rights, the right of the Israeli State to exist in perpetuity, of course, but also the right of the Palestinian State to exist, to be recognised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the recent downward spiral of internecine violence between armed secular Fatah and Islamist Hamas militias in Gaza is of grave concern, as we now see the consequences of a weakened Israeli leadership post-Lebanese war and a weakened Palestinian President Abbas having to deal with the religious fundamentalists within Hamas, who won the elections last year. The Hamas members of the unity government are clearly not able to break away from their intransigent positions based on theocratic obscurantist views that the State of Israel can never be explicitly recognised, that terrorist violence is justified and that they are not bound by previous agreements signed by the late Chairman Arafat.</p>
      <p sl="en">So clearly this Palestinian Authority unity government does not fulfil the Quartet criteria and the EU cannot lift the ban on Hamas as a terrorist organisation or directly fund the Palestinian Authority at present, relying instead on the TIM for delivery of humanitarian aid which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen during the last three years. There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs, as evidenced by the recent proposals from the Arab League, of the desirability of a negotiated solution. The Israelis all recognise the damage to Israel’s economy and society of the continuing violence after the recent spate of over 100 Qassam missiles launched by Hamas at civilian areas. In fact there was one fatality last week which constitutes, in my view, a war crime under international law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace. Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arab States that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel’s long-term security is best served by recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own secure state also.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the Palestinian Authority must first be able to secure law and order on its territory, which it is failing signally to do right now. Securing the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston and the kidnapped soldier, Corporal Shalit, would be a great start and create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is not, of course, a matter of doubt that Israel is entitled to defend itself against the Kassam missiles, for firing them at civilian facilities and persons is a crime. It is a provocation to Israel, but also to the government currently in power in Palestine. One might even say that that is the main object of the exercise – and what is the European Union doing about it?</p>
      <p sl="de">I regret to have to tell Mr Gloser that the answer he has given – on behalf of the Council presidency, of course – is quite utterly unsatisfactory, no less so than the one given at the last debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are doing nothing to strengthen the hand of those forces that alone are capable of taking action against these terrorists. Our statements will change nothing, nor, alas, will Israel’s retaliatory military actions, justified though they may be in individual cases, if the European Union does not give this government a chance. I say ‘government’, for it is cynical to decide which individual ministers one will meet with and which one to avoid; I did mention last time round that the President of the Council was having meetings with the Israeli foreign minister, but, when it came to meeting his Palestinian counterpart, claimed that she was not in the habit of meeting foreign ministers. That way of going about things is not really going to produce results.</p>
      <p sl="de">While I have no desire to make life difficult for the Commissioner for Foreign Relations, she did in fact talk in terms of supporting the government rather than individual ministers, and while the pair of them say we have to support Abbas, they are not actually doing so by denying their backing to his government and failing to enable it to take action against terrorism and those who engage in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the problem; if Europe does not commit itself to doing that all these talks will avail us nothing, since peace can be established only from within, and there will be peace only if there are, in Palestine, strong forces that can enforce their will by reason of their getting support – be it political, moral or financial – from the European Union in their fight against the terrorists. That will help both Palestine and Israel. Let me say once again that, if you want to help Israel, you have to give this government a chance. Nothing else is worthy of being taken seriously.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Months later, an escalation of rivalry between Fatah and Hamas only made matters worse.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I ask your understanding for the fact that I am able, at the moment, to make only a few brief comments, as I have a meeting with your Committee on Foreign Affairs at 6.00 p.m., when I will be reviewing and evaluating the last meeting of the General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">While I can understand all the things you have said, not least that which has been said on the basis of your own travels and discussions, I would ask you also to take note of the fact that it was the European Union, notably the previous and current presidencies, that actually did something about reviving the Middle East Quartet and getting some sort of process in motion, without which process the Saudi Arabian initiative would not have happened, and so I would ask you to take a nuanced view and bear in mind that certain things cannot be attributed to the immobility of certain funds. This is, after all, an intra-Palestinian conflict. We have of course – as I made clear in the statement on behalf of the presidency – spelled out in our talks with Israel that the funds rightly due to the Palestinians, in the shape of customs duties and taxes, must be returned to them if various infrastructure measures are to be guaranteed. The Commissioner has, on repeated occasions, and not least to the Council, commented on how the European Union has been providing support over recent months. The public may occasionally have got the impression that we are paying too little or nothing at all, but the opposite is in fact the case, for the European Union has, and during a very critical period, transferred more funds than it had done under other conditions previously.</p>
      <p sl="de">To Mr Davis, I would like to say that we do not want the Palestinians, on the grounds of their expecting everything, to have to be seen as some sort of saints, but one thing that did become clear from the Mecca conference when attempts were being made to put together a government of national unity, was that the conditions on which the Middle East quartet has always insisted must be met, those being the right of Israel to exist, the renunciation of violence and also the discharge of the obligations entered into by the previous government. Certain things are moving, but there is as yet no clarity as to whether the government is committed to those things. There is absolutely no reason for us to put up some sort of wall; the government of national unity could well take this step, and the conditions could be established. We are not, after all, treating this as a marginal issue; every time it meets, the Council considers how progress can be made. As I have already said, the presidency is trying to arrange, in the immediate future, a meeting of the Middle East quartet, since we know just how much depends on that. The High Representative, who is currently in Beirut, many kilometres to the north, knows that this is not just about Palestine and Israel, but also about the issue of Lebanon’s security and its right to self-determination.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to urge that we should go beyond just talking and try to get some initiatives off the ground to the end not only that there may be a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians, but also that financial aid be given and that we may – as I have just again looked up – ask Israel to facilitate freedom of movement for the Palestinians, so that they may no longer be penned in in the way that they currently are, in a situation with which nobody can be satisfied. I crave the House’s indulgence, but I really must now leave your debate.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying here with us today. Unlike many MEPs, I have been to Palestine more than once. In line with what everyone here wished, Israel has left Gaza, and handed it over to a free, democratically elected government. Gaza is therefore not some military outpost, it is a country devastated by the extremism, fundamentalism, terrorism, corruption and cynicism of the Palestinian warlords themselves.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, are we naïve enough to think that throwing more hundreds of millions of euros without clear guidelines will stop Jund Al-Islam or Mohamed Dahlan from further acts of violence? Do we honestly believe that legalising warlords and terrorists like Khaled Mashal or Dahlan will bring peace to the region? Fortunately, the Council and the Commission have taken a firm, clear stance, and I wish to thank them for that. I am grateful that on this tricky matter, they have adopted the right position. We should reject violence and pay tribute to the victims of Gaza and the West Bank. We must state clearly our opposition to Hamas using its power in the Palestinian Government to attack Israel to further its appallingly extremist interests. I wish to warn against working with Hamas, including Members of the government, as this is clearly proscribed, or with new Al-Qaeda organisations such as Fatah Al-Islam and Jund Al-Islam.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We call on the Palestinian Government not only to recognise the exchange of letters between Rabin and Arafat but also to stop lying about fulfilling the key condition of recognising Israel. We call on the Palestinian Government and on all Arab politicians, in particular the Saudis and Egyptians, to acknowledge all of their political and human responsibilities and to take part immediately in peace negotiations involving full recognition of the State of Israel within duly recognised international borders. We call on Fatah to begin negotiations with Hamas without delay on the sharing of power within the President’s Office. It is only by adopting the right position and having a clearly-stated standpoint that we will be able genuinely to provide humanitarian aid and, most importantly, to support the emergence of a viable, democratic Palestinian state.</p>

That was a very tense time, but now, two weeks on, that tension has increased and unfortunately the citizens of the region are expecting less and less of the EU. In spite of the various sources of tension, Parliament sought to be there on the ground. It was indeed there, and today, despite the increased tension, Mr Solana is also in the region.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We saw human tragedy, which you described, Commissioner, and which you of course acknowledge. We also saw a wall 852 km in length, which, with a view to combating violence and to keeping Israelis safe from Arab attacks, has invaded 25% of West Bank territory and has annexed territory that is central to any peace agreement based on the 1967 plan. It is a wall that imprisons people in their own homes, that stops children from getting to school and that stops farmers from cultivating their land. It is a wall that has turned Gaza into the best-known open prison in the world. It is a prison which, according to a decision by the Israeli police at the beginning of 2006, no one – or should that be nothing – is to enter or leave.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, we all look on bemused and deny any involvement. Today we hope that Mr Solana’s eyes and heart can convey some hope to these people on our behalf.

Any educated member of the public following it might think that very many Members of the European Parliament had very limited knowledge about the history of the Palestinian and Israeli region. How did the state of Israel come about? What was the Balfour Declaration and so on? What was the UN resolution at the time? What was the basis for the partition? It is shameful of us parliamentarians if we do not first do our homework but instead come and speak very emotionally about things we do not necessarily know about. That is why it is fitting to stop and consider what the issue actually is in this region, and take an overall view of it instead of just hinting at it momentarily.</p>

      <p sl="nl">A huge number of illegal settlements are being set up on the West Bank. We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreases. In Gaza, 87% of the people are living below the poverty line. There are still 41 Palestinian members of parliament behind bars and the subject of refugees returning is not being touched upon at all. The wall is indeed growing into the world’s largest, something in which Israel can surely take pride.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Despite this, the Palestinians are also entitled to self-determination and a dignified existence, and they are prepared to bring sacrifices and compromise. They have shown explicitly and on several occasions that they want peace and prosperity for their people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Do the international community and the European Union still actually want this, though? I wonder about this sometimes, not least when I hear the Commissioner say today that, following talks with the minister, she heard the request made of the government of national unity to give its support and that Abbas has made the same request. So why do you not recognise the government? What are you really waiting for? When will you finally give the Palestinian Authority direct support?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I heard the presidency talk about the Quartet requirements, but we should not wait for a new Quartet meeting. The European Union could take the lead in this. We need to talk to the government as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, today we once again have to deal with the dreadful situation in the Middle East. Since 6 May, thirty-six Palestinians, including eleven civilians, have died in Israeli raids on Gaza. On the other side, 146 rockets have been fired at the Israeli town of Sderot, wounding six people. The Palestinians are fighting amongst themselves. In Lebanon, the 3 000 refugees in the Nahr Al-Bared camp are paying the price for the fighting between the Lebanese army and the extremists of Fatah-al-Islam. In this regard, let us state clearly that there is never any justification for killing civilian populations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More generally, we must call for a radical change to Europe’s policy on the Middle East. It is no longer acceptable to refuse to support politically and financially, and with no exclusions, a Palestinian Government of national unity that we have advocated passionately and that, if we are to believe the Palestinian Foreign Minister, whom we received recently, firstly, respects political pluralism, secondly, does not question the existence of the Israeli State, thirdly, calls for the recognition of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, and fourthly, renews its commitment to the UN and Arab resolutions, particularly on the refugee issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us think clearly, the peace initiative drawn up at the Riyadh Summit has no chance of succeeding unless we Europeans work towards lifting the political and economic siege being suffered by the Palestinian Government. Fifteen months of blockade, 70% of the population living below the poverty line and 50% unemployment provide an ideal breeding ground for fundamentalism and terrorism but do not provide a government with the best conditions for restoring law and order.

Growing into a young man I was very upset to realise how wrong I was: that there were in fact two kinds of people – those whose lives matter and those whose lives do not matter. Then, I became involved in politics and I was taught that what was really important was not what is right but what brings in votes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Therefore, why waste our time debating Palestine when we know that nothing significant will come of it?

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all long for peace in the Middle East. Nonetheless, the suggestion that the European Union should resume provision of its entire package of financial aid directly to the government of the Palestinian Authority is decidedly premature.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Holding democratic elections in a country is not enough to justify the award of European aid. The European Union certainly does refuse to allow expenditure of its taxpayers’ money in a number of democratic countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe there are two fundamental reasons for disallowing expenditure. The first is if the country concerned simply does not require our aid. The second is if the country concerned does not recognise or does not implement fundamental principles that are crucial for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is this second reason that applies to Palestine. Essentially, the disagreement over financing does not centre on Israel or Palestine; it centres on our own principles. The potential beneficiary is refusing to recognise the donor’s right to implement certain basic principles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not be spending time debating when to use the terms terrorism or fight for freedom. What we should instead be debating is whether it is possible to support an organisation whose programme centres on promoting the use of force against others. Can we support those who really do not want peace? The answer to the question as to whether we should finance authorities that do not want peace is obvious, or so it would seem. We should not. The reasons why we should deny support have nothing to do with the chaos in the Palestinian Authority, or with the uncertainty about how long the national unity government is likely to be able to govern. They have nothing to do with how long that government will be able to exercise genuine power. They have nothing to do either with the fact that 50 Palestinians were killed last week in clashes between Hamas and Fatah, nor do they have anything to do with the fact that children’s television broadcasts by the Al-Aksa station call on Palestinian children to help destroy Israel and take part in the war. The main reason why we should deny aid is that we must be true to our own principles, values and past.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be clearly stated that the choice between victory and martyrdom offered by Prime Minister Hanieh is flawed and detrimental to the national interests of the Palestinian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was mildly encouraged by what the Commissioner had to say and, frankly, thoroughly depressed by what the Council had to say. It seems incredible that the Council fails to recognise that the creation of a government of national unity in Palestine was a major political risk both for Fatah and Hamas. The platform of unity government is a platform of negotiations and trying to reach peace, something the Council failed to acknowledge.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe – and I think the majority in this House now believes – that the time has come to stop all restrictions on our dealings with the Palestinian Authority. The Commissioner has said today that the conditions for renewing direct aid have almost been met. Commissioner, let us not wait for protection. I plead with you to go to the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting and ask them to recognise the Palestinian Authority’s government of national unity. If the Palestinian Government fails to keep its promise, of course we can then end our negotiations and our involvement with them, but let us give them a chance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government does nothing to end the cycle of violence or tackle the grave humanitarian crisis that so many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about this afternoon. Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government also does nothing to encourage Israel to end its financial and military assaults on Palestine. Even today, the Deputy Defence Minister of Israel warned that his country could single out the leader of Hamas, the current Palestinian Prime Minister, for extrajudicial killing. Does anyone really believe that actions such as this would help the peace process?</p>

    <intervention id="2-274" speaker_id="4529" name="Sarah Ludford" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, after the tragic failure of the Bush administration to push for an Israel/Palestine peace deal in the last five years, the Arab peace initiative is a rare bright spot. The release of Corporal Shalit and Alan Johnston and the 40 Palestinian legislators would create much-needed goodwill. The fact that the EU and the US are maintaining links with Palestinian Foreign and Finance Ministers shows that there is no boycott, no failure to engage and the hundreds of millions of euros of humanitarian aid mean our back is not turned to the peoples’ plight.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is very difficult to conceive of resuming budgetary support to the PA when the unity government has not, despite some claims to the contrary, fulfilled the Quartet demands. Even if we do not attribute to Prime Minister Haniyeh the continuing statements of Hamas spokesmen vowing to destroy Israel, we cannot ignore his invocation of God or martyrdom to rally Palestinians just last night. Colleagues who wished to argue pragmatically that the unity government is the best deal on offer should stick to that justification for supping with them and not try to persuade us that something has happened which has not.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our message to every Israeli, every Palestinian, every member of Hamas or Fatah must be: In the name of your god and for the sake of your children, pull back!</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we have the Israeli spokesman threatening to kill the elected Prime Minister of Palestine; we have the Hamas threats to seek vengeance; we have Fatah and Hamas in and out of conflict with each other; the killing of a Palestinian family on a Gaza beach leading to the capturing of the soldier Shalit, which led to attack and counterattack, tit for tat and on it goes. Stop; think; talk. Release soldier Shalit, release Alan Johnston and release the speaker and the 40 members of the elected Palestinian Parliament. And to the EU I say, engage with both the Palestinian Government and with the Israeli Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, one says, let us find ways of ending the causes of violence, and the biggest cause is poverty. Palestinian poverty has rocketed and poverty comes from withheld taxes, from unpaid employees, from trade and banking embargoes. It is time for all that to end before it ends in more violence. It is time to stop and remove illegal settlements. It is time to stop and remove that gruesome, cruel, immoral wall, and it is time, Commissioner, to publish the document compiled by the heads of mission in Jerusalem and Ramallah, who reported on East Jerusalem and whose summary was that Israel’s activities in Jerusalem are in violation both of its roadmap obligations and of international law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us have that out in the open; let us talk, and let us then persuade everybody to think about their children’s future, stop the violence and work for peace.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Violence and unrest continue in the Palestinian territories. The world’s press agencies bring daily news of the numbers of injured and dead. Despite repeated ceasefire declarations between Fatah and Hamas, the armed conflict between the two factions goes on. The shelling of the town of Sderot from the Gaza Strip and retaliation from the Israeli side also continues. Palestinian health workers and teachers have gone on strike, and Palestinian policemen and other public service workers have not been paid. As has been said on a number of occasions, poverty is rising fast. Over 80% of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip live on less than USD 2 per day.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The bottom line is that Palestine and Israel need our help because they will not be able to escape the cycle of violence on their own. I count myself among those MEPs who are calling for broader and deeper EU support. I should therefore like to call on the Commission, once again, to do all it can to mobilise international assistance as rapidly and as effectively as possible. I feel that if this does not happen, the probability will increase of Palestinian self-rule collapsing completely and of all-out civil war being unleashed, with incalculable consequences not only for Palestine but also for the whole of the Middle East. The same can be said, too, of Lebanon.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it has been a very passionate discussion and I completely understand why because, as I said before, we all feel a great frustration. But you have to understand that, over the last 10 years, the European Union has really tried to play an important role for the peace process – not in order to enhance the conflict but in order to make peace, or help to make peace. In the end it is always the two parties that have to be ready, but we try to push them. We were then quite happy to be an important and influential member of the Quartet.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we can only be a facilitator of this peace. That means we have to look to both sides. We cannot just go to one side, and therefore we feel that we embraced the three Quartet principles as important basic principles. It really is the Council, not the Commission, that can recognise the Government – there are 27 Member States. I understand if you ask me to do so, but it is not me who can take this decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know there is one instrument which you have indirectly mentioned: the cancellation or suspension of the association agreement with Israel; but do you really think this would make a difference? I do not think it would. We would no longer be a facilitator of this process, so it would be the wrong instrument at this moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have as an instrument is a continuous political dialogue where all the parties work with all the parties, but it is true that there are other members of the Quartet too, for instance the United States of America, as has been mentioned. It is very important that we feel that there is also a push from that side too. Over the last months, we have seen a much greater effort on the part of the USA, particularly from Condoleezza Rice. We have all welcomed that and have tried to move forward. The German Presidency, in particular Mrs Merkel, but also Foreign Minister Steinmeier, have really tried to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">A political solution can never be brought about by violence. Unfortunately, we now have violence again. I can promise – and this is within the Commission’s competence – that we will further engage with the National Unity Government, as we have started to do. But as we have said our policy is a gradual engagement and we cannot do everything. Even Salam Fayad said to me when I first met him after the formation of the Government that I would need some time to clean up the mess in the Finance Ministry – and this is still not completely done. Therefore, we are nearly there, the technical conditions would be ready, but you also know that the Council has to give us some political backing. I want you to understand these things.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the situation is very dramatic, and I hope that the Council understands that we have to engage in order to help this National Unity Government achieve the right platform to continue with the peace process and with the talks on the political horizon. We know that it is a complicated situation, and that is why I said that I see at least some positive hope in the fact that Foreign Minister Livni will attend the next Council meeting after the very positive meeting we had with the Arab League, but on the ground I agree that the situation is very difficult, and, besides all this, it is also those factions and those different radical groups that are outside the Government that would like to jeopardise the whole process. It is a vicious circle and I agree that we have to try to break it up.</p>
      <p sl="en">An honourable Member mentioned that we have extended our mission monitoring the Rafah border crossing. We did that because we think that opening up freedom of movement of goods and people is so important. I myself have been working on that with Prime Minister Olmert. I remember my last visit there when I took it up in order really to go into the details. But there are security concerns. Unfortunately, there are suicide bombers coming over the borders, a lot of funds are being smuggled, so you always have the two sides of this conflict, but we think that it is important to have prolonged this mission at the Rafah crossing because only with the European Union is there a chance of there being an opening.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are engaging. We are also working with the Finance Minister, not only on the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), but also on institution building and technical assistance, helping them particularly on the question of customs, revenue collection and on auditing. This has been asked for by Salam Fayad, so we are working with them. I said we will also look at what we can then perhaps fund through the TIM as regards their particular desires, so not only those things that we have been funding up till now in order to help the population to survive, but to go further.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what I can offer you in this delicate and difficult situation. We have to go on pushing and bringing the different parties together. I hope that the time window is still open.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question no 30 by David Martin (H-0301/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The negative consequences of the EU biofuels targets</p>
      <p sl="unknown">83% of the world's biofuels are produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. In part a response to the EU's growing demand for biofuels, both Indonesia and Malaysia are deforesting large areas of land often high conservation rainforest for oil palm plantations. Is the Commission aware that, according to a recent UN report, 98% of these forests could be gone by 2022? Is the Commission aware of the effects that deforestation has on native wildlife, for example, that many orang-utans end up in rehabilitation centres with little hope of being released back into the wild? According to a Dutch pressure group, as much as 50% of space for new plantations is cleared by draining and burning peat land, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How can the Commission reconcile the EU's target to cut emissions by 20% by 2020 with the possible increase of Indonesia and Malaysia's carbon emissions (Indonesia has been ranked the world's third largest producer of CO2 by the same pressure group)? What plans does the Commission have to introduce eco labelling of 'sustainable' palm oils? Will the Commission consider a ban on the import of biofuels into the EU?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-281" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member’s concern about deforestation and peat land draining in South-East Asia. It is aware of the link with the fast-growing demand for palm oil. Production of palm oil is growing at about 9 % per year; more than 80 % of the production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In deciding how to tackle this problem, it is essential to have a clear picture of the supply of and demand for palm oil. About 1% of the world’s biofuels came from Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil in 2006. The main use of palm oil today is in food and other non-energy sectors. Only 1% of palm oil production from Indonesia and Malaysia was used for biofuel production in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, demand for bioenergy is likely to rise in the future, and not only in the European Union, and that leads to increased production of palm oil for biofuels. Having said that, the Commission is aware that, if nothing is done, the increasing demand for biofuel, linked to the proposed Community biofuel target for 2020, could create additional environmental pressures, which would be contrary to the sustainable approach supported by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, no mandatory certification exists that will guarantee that tropical rainforests or peat lands in South East Asia are not suffering from the production of palm oil, regardless of its use. Within the framework of its legislative proposal, the Commission will therefore include a biofuel sustainability scheme designed to ensure that the biofuel sector plays its part in tackling this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is currently working on the design of this scheme. It aims to include measures to deter the conversion of both tropical forests and peat lands for biofuel production, as well as measures to deter the use of production methods that are inefficient in greenhouse gas terms. These measures will apply to domestically produced biofuels as well as imported biofuels. In view of the above, any attempt to deal comprehensively with the impact of oil palm cultivation on the environment would need to take into account oil palm production for all end users.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, the Council and Parliament have all expressed support for a balanced approach to biofuels in which domestic production and imports will both contribute to meeting the huge requirement, but production will be carried out on a sustainable basis.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-282" speaker_id="1403" name="David Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Thank you, Commissioner, for that reply. Do you accept that the objective of the biofuels policy of the European Union is to reduce global emissions, not just European Union emissions? My concern and the concern that lies behind this question is that if we only measure the emissions from biofuels in Europe and not the emissions involved in the production and shipping of those biofuels, we might not actually be contributing to the reduction in global emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner said about the sustainability scheme. Will the Commission look at how we can distinguish between good and bad biofuels from the point of view of emissions?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-283" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I definitely agree that our global scheme is to fight global emissions of CO2 and for this reason we are certainly looking at the carbon footprint of biofuels use.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, if the biofuels produced in one region would have to be transported to another region, we cannot artificially forbid this. For this reason, our scheme should include that the best biofuels are the more rewarded with the support and in this way it is a part of the scheme that will not encourage transporting palm oil to supply our market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Additionally, I believe it is extremely important to understand that we need to work in parallel towards a way of protecting peat lands and rainforests. Because, whatever we do, we perhaps will be sustainable. There will be other regions that will just go for palm oil.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, in the negotiations which are to start in Bali, we need to work towards a scheme for protecting the rainforests, as well as looking at how to encourage the planting of more forests on the Earth, not for palm oil for our transport, but for less CO2 emissions from transport as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to ask how an increase in the production of biofuel might affect the food market. The American maize used to produce biofuel is significantly more expensive than grain. In the long term, as we transit to such renewable energy sources, will we then have crises in the food production market?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-285" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">It is a justified question. There is a lot of land in the European Union that is not being used. Therefore much of this land could be used for producing biomass, not only for biofuels but also for producing heat, for cooling or for producing electricity. A number of countries have a situation that is sustainable; they produce 12 % of their electricity from biomass. At the same time, they also produce biofuels. So there is potential for using that land. If I look at the second generation of biofuels, there is land that could be used for producing biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has calculated that the European Union could cover 14% of its needs, even if we do not import biofuels from other parts of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the increase in the price of food products, this is influenced by many elements. You mentioned the example of maize. The price of corn is decided on the global market and it has been highly affected by the severe drought in Australia and the potential growth in the United States. There is some correlation if the farmer is given the choice of using his land for producing either biofuels or basic foodstuffs. But I believe the market will respond appropriately and, if our sustainability scheme that will encourage the production of biofuels with fewer CO2 emissions is put in place, there will be a balance in this market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have never said that we will be able to replace all the oil we use with biofuels. There is potential both in the European Union and globally, but it will never replace all the oil we use. At this stage I would say that it is not a question of food prices or the use of biofuels, because globally biofuels are used on a very small scale and they definitely have not had any impact at this stage on the price of foodstuffs.</p>

    <intervention id="2-286" speaker_id="2206" name="Reinhard Rack" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you quite rightly said that it makes perfectly good sense to now use fallow land for the cultivation of plants from which fuel can be produced. This currently makes for a problem as regards the production of barley for brewing purposes, since the subsidies for the production of biofuels make the cultivation of other crops a more attractive proposition for farmers, so, back home, we have had problems that affect our own economy, in cultivating the crops necessary for the brewing of beer, which is not the least important of economic sectors.</p>

      <p sl="de">One might well ask which is the more important – food or energy? In the days when we still had our own supplies of crude oil and natural gas, the situation was quite different; now we have to import everything. Even though we know that global demand for crude oil and natural gas is on the rise, we still aspire to maintain the same standard of comfort, and consequently, some of our efforts have to be devoted to the production of energy. As I have said, we currently have so much in the way of reserves and options, that we have to make the fullest possible use of the latter.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must, however, also be smart enough not to do something for which we will have to pay a high price later on. The schemes we are devising constitute a first step. We have every chance of organising them in such a way that no great problems ensue for the food industry.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question no 31 by Danute Budreikaite (H-0303/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Energy agreement between EU Member States and Russia</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Commission's publication of the energy package in January 2007 brought fresh impetus to the efforts being made by some Member States regarding the supply of energy resources from Russia through the conclusion of bilateral or trilateral agreements with that country.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Russia, Greece and Bulgaria have signed an agreement on an oil pipeline linking the Black Sea and the Aegean. Construction work is to start at the end of 2007, and the pipeline is to be completed in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Hungary is to build the gas pipeline 'Blue Stream' in cooperation with the Russian Gazprom. The pipeline is to start in Turkey and pass through Bulgaria and Romania. This gas pipeline will follow the same course as the Nabucco pipeline planned by the EU. A new agreement with Russia is entitled 'Agreement on the diversification of gas supply'.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What is the Commission's view of such a diversification of energy supply where the supplier is the same Gazprom? What impact might such agreements have on the implementation of the EU's common energy policy?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-289" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">These are issues that we have discussed previously: how to supply the European Union with sufficient energy resources. As you know today 50% of our energy supplies are covered by imports and we know that in the future the percentage will be even higher. It could be 65%, with more than 80% of gas being imported and even more oil, with over 90% being imported.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason we will continue to work with all traditional suppliers. For gas it is Russia which today provides 27.5% of our supplies. Oil is supplied by Norway at 14% and Algeria at 12.5%. For this reason, we are interested in strengthening ties with traditional suppliers and obtaining more supply routes. Supply routes that deliver gas and oil are exposed to danger. I would mention a recent explosion in the Ukrainian gas pipeline system. That certainly had an impact on transport but, because there were other ways of delivering gas, it did not affect the EU internal market. However, it is very clear that having more supply routes is more beneficial for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU dependency on Russia should not be over-emphasised because it is clear that, with Russia having the biggest gas resources as well as being one of the countries with the biggest oil resources, it is natural that supplies from Russia are topping our import list. The Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline is in my opinion a very important project because it bypasses the Turkish Straits. In this way, it reduces first of all the possibility of an environmental disaster and secondly it is an additional supply route to channel oil that is produced north of the Caspian to European markets. So, for this reason, this project also got support from the Commission because it is an additional supply route and it does not increase our dependence on Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time it is very important to diversify; first because relying on one supplier gives the monopoly supplier a chance to dictate the price but also because it gives an opportunity to influence consumer choices. For this reason the European Union has actively diversified its supply. One of the areas where we have been getting supplies this year is the Caspian Sea and Shah-Deniz in Azerbaijan, where we have established very good cooperation from the countries surrounding Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nabucco will be the next project that will be implemented. Nabucco is a more ambitious project. It will take a bit more time but we are well on track to obtaining supplies from this source through the fourth potential gas supply corridor. At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan, an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are encouraging cooperation with these countries around the world because, even if there are three big suppliers to the gas market – Russia, Iran and Qatar – there are other suppliers who could increase supplies. Norway will increase supplies to the European Union in the next few years by close to 50%. The same is happening with Algeria, which will provide additional supplies and more and more LNG terminals are coming on-stream.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, I believe that we should continue to work with Russia. We should continue to buy energy resources because, for Russia, the EU is the best possible market because it is the closest market and mutual ties have existed for some time, but for security of supply it is important to diversify.</p>
      <p sl="en">Additionally, I would like to stress two further elements because it is never the case that you can rely only on imports. It is important to develop energy sources inside the European Union, to be extremely energy-efficient and to build internal energy infrastructure whether it be pipelines or electricity transmission lines. The European Union is very active in all these areas, even if we always recognise that each country decides on its own energy mix. But, through the instruments of the internal market and through the instruments given us by European legislation, we are encouraging the use of local resources and being very energy-efficient.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I thank our Commission colleague for the answer and the hopes expressed that we will nevertheless find other, alternative sources of energy. As I said in my question, and in regard to the current situation, it is evident that no matter what agreements are in place, at the other end of the pipeline, be it a petroleum pipeline or a gas pipeline, there is Russia. Russia has stopped delivering petroleum to Lithuania, and it is doing the same to Latvia. Therefore, we cannot put much trust in this source of supply. Nevertheless, I would ask that we all make a united effort in seeking to quickly implement projects for other, alternative sources of energy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well, I always advise Member States to be active. I hope that they hear what you are saying and what I am saying because it is always important for Member States to cooperate among themselves and look for alternatives. Theoretically, if there is a need, the Baltic States could use one additional energy terminal.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is the governments that should decide how to diversify and how to cooperate and how to get interconnection. I am very glad that we have managed to interconnect the Baltic countries’ market with Finland. Now the big task is to achieve interconnection with Poland and in the future with the other Nordic countries. This would also eliminate the risk of a possible disruption of supply from one direction affecting the whole country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the financial support for the Trans-European Networks (TENs) is to be secured; is there a planned date for when money will actually be forthcoming for these TEN pipelines – Nabucco or Bluestream, for example – and could you envisage a timetable being prepared in time for the 2008 review?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-293" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">The Commission can offer only partial support in this area, since there are fewer resources available to us for it in the Budget. We do, of course, support those companies and enterprises that are able to invest money in it, for investment in energy transport is economically of very considerable interest. What I can say right now is that the timetable for Nabucco has been decided on and that the date of 2012 has been set. The Commission has already given financial support to a limited extent, but political support is important too. Over the coming months, the coordinator of the project will be announced, and this will of course be done in collaboration with your House.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is my belief that the adoption of the energy package will enable us to get back to this issue when the Budget perspective is debated; I also take the view that it is necessary to set aside more funds for the trans-European energy networks in views of the directions involved that may well be strategically important, but are not as profitable for the business sector.

      <p sl="en">Thank you for your answers, Commissioner, they are really impressive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask you whether the Commission has noticed that Russia has never created difficulties as regards supplying ‘old’ EU Member States with oil and gas, whereas with Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary and other new EU Member States, there have been many difficulties. What do you think about these first- and second-class forms of treatment?</p>

      <p sl="en">There are two explanations for this. First of all, sometimes new Member States’ policies have not been very clear as regards diversification; at least some of the new Member States have not tried to encourage as much diversification as could be possible, thereby becoming more dependent on one supplier, Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I do not think that Russia does this on purpose; it is just because those countries are the first in line whenever supplies are disrupted and, as they are more exposed than older Member States in terms of diversification of supply, they are affected more. Member States should do much more and invest more in the diversification of the energy mix, of supply routes and of suppliers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, when the infrastructure is affected, those countries are the first to have a problem because the historical networks were constructed precisely to connect Russia, as a supplier, with those countries, as consumers. That is why this perception exists, but I would repeat that diversification is the key to avoiding this state of affairs, and every country should embark on diversification in order to minimise any problem that may arise in the transport of supplies. I believe also that the suppliers would then take more care to deliver in the best possible time and to repair the networks as soon as possible if any leaks occur.</p>

      <p sl="en">Racist and xenophobic violence and hate speech are a very sad reality all around Europe. According to the 2006 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the majority of Member States have recorded an increase in racist violence and other racist crimes over the past few years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always rejected and condemned in the strongest possible terms all manifestations and expressions of racism, regardless of their source and form of manifestation. A measure to fight racist speech is perfectly compatible with freedom of expression if – and only if – it respects Article 10(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be the first to admit that defining the border between safeguarding freedom of expression and defining racist speech as a penal crime is not an easy task and that it requires careful consideration. However, I am convinced that there is no contradiction in simultaneously protecting people against racist speech and making sure that freedom of expression remains one of the key pillars upon which our societies are founded.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the spirit in which the Council reached a political agreement on 20 April 2007 on a framework decision aimed at ensuring that racism and xenophobia are punishable in all Member States by effective, proportionate criminal penalties. This framework decision requires Member States to criminalise intentional conduct, such as public incitement to violence or hate towards a group of people or persons belonging to a group defined on the basis of race.</p>
      <p sl="en">Incitement to violence or hatred will also have to be made punishable throughout the EU if committed by public dissemination or distribution of pictures. Distribution in this context means disseminating action by any means of transmission, including through websites.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not aware of any parliamentary action in the UK or in other Member States to tackle those websites. However, the framework decision is expected to lead to the adoption of new legislation, at least in certain Member States, to address racist crimes, including those committed via the internet.</p>

Now that they are on the web they are equally as offensive. Do you feel the framework decision will do the job adequately or do you feel that the cybercrime communication, which again is current, may be a way forward or do you believe it is just a question of asking Member States to implement adequate laws which will cope with an accelerating rise in the most offensive sites which excite racial hatred and violence based on difference?</p>

      <p sl="it">Obviously, with the use of technology we ought to succeed in detecting even those using more advanced technologies, such as private providers or SIM cards that have not been officially registered.

      <p sl="unknown">Question no 34 by Glenis Willmott (H-0300/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU-wide hotline for victims of forced prostitution</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Following pressure from the European Parliament back in June 2006, the EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security spoke of plans to establish an EU-wide (multilingual) hotline for victims of forced prostitution. The aim of the hotline would be to provide first assistance for the victims of trafficking, enabling victims to talk to an impartial listener, an important channel for encouraging victims to seek advice and support. The difficulty in getting all telephone companies in the then 25-Member bloc to agree was cited as an obstacle in the setting-up of such a hotline.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What measures is the Commission currently taking to turn this hotline into reality and what progress, if any, has been made in bringing the telephone companies on board this plan?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-306" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As you know the Commission and I personally are committed to fully implementing the European action plan against trafficking in human beings which I proposed here at the beginning of 2006 and which this Parliament endorsed. This action covers the protection of victims of trafficking. Its implementation requires close cooperation between Member States, institutions and civil society organisations. The action plan should be regarded as a long-term programme which will guide continuous EU action in the near future and in any case far beyond summer 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">I consider free telephone helplines as a valuable mechanism, offering advice to victims in need. They are particularly useful to spread confidence. I am committed to setting up without any delay a hotline for victims and those vulnerable to trafficking, covering all Member States in the European Union. You may know perhaps that on 15 February 2007 we adopted, as a Commission, a decision which requires Member States to reserve a range of six-digit national telephone numbers for single freephone numbers all beginning with 116 for services with social values. One of the many subjects to be covered could be telephone hotlines for victims of trafficking in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="en">The above decision has already reserved the number 116000 for hotlines to report missing children. I will discuss the latter project in more detail at a Conference on an International Day for Missing Children which will be held in Brussels on 25 May, and at the Conference on the Rights of the Child, to be held in Berlin on 4 June 2007. ‘116’ numbers can be compared with the emergency number 112 in that they will give access to national or local organisations providing the service in question in the Member State in which the call was placed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have launched a public consultation for identifying other services which would benefit from single European freephone numbers. This consultation was open for proposals until 20 May. This is expected to lead to other numbers being reserved for other services later in the year. Making them operational, allowing for citizens to be able to call these numbers, will then be the task of Member States, their telecom regulatory authorities and telephone operators.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reservation of a common number and the creation of a network of hotlines is the first practical step to support victims. In addition to setting up a network of hotlines we seek to improve the assistance to victims of trafficking by other means too. My firm commitment to the issue is confirmed by the fact that the 2007 budget establishing a specific programme to fight against crime foresees four projects in the field of prevention and fight against crime in specific areas, including trafficking. We are also supporting the creation of a European anti-trafficking day, which aims to increase the visibility of the problem connected with trafficking. The initiative will take place on 18 October this year. We are highly committed to raising awareness and reinforcing policy means in order to provide quality services for those in need of assistance.</p>

We are gradually extending the possibility, laid down in the contract with the contractors that will provide the service, that as a minimum all the official languages of the European Union will be spoken. Obviously we must also think about languages such as Russian. For now, as a first stage, the contract will be awarded before the summer holidays, so that this telephone number can actually be used, and we will launch a massive publicity campaign.

      <p sl="en">In answer to the Honourable Member's question, I should like to say that the European Union’s strategy in terms of people with disabilities has been laid down in the Disability Action Plan of 2003-2010, where access to ICT is a priority. You might also know that one of the pillars of the i2010 Action Plan is inclusion. On that basis, the Commission adopted a communication on e-accessibility in 2005 and a communication on e-inclusion is in preparation for the end of 2007 and in this text there will be a proposal for new actions when appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not only working on concrete actions in that way, we are also encouraging our research efforts in the direction of developing new methodologies and new services for the disabled. We also have the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme – the CIP – which supports our ICT policy with pilot projects and so on and so forth. Several actions are proposed on e-accessibility and on something that will become very important in the future – ICT for the elderly. Very often they are the people, because there are people with disabilities and very often the elderly have those disabilities too and they represent a very high future percentage of our population. That is why ICT for the elderly for ambient living will become one of the strong elements of our future policies, not only in theory but also in research and in practical implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also supporting standardisation on e-accessibility. For instance, we have taken an initiative to harmonise at EU level the accessibility requirements for public procurement in the ICT domain through an EU standard, because we believe that common standards can facilitate the development of accessible ICT products by the industry, leading to more uptake which also means to lower prices. Therefore the one is linked to the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also some vertical issues. In June 2006 we will propose strengthening the right of disabled users to access emergency services and introducing a Community mechanism to address e-accessibility issues. We will have an opportunity to discuss those problems with Parliament when together we will try to find a solution for the universal service. There will be a public consultation on the scope by the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 – I do not know yet exactly when – but that will be the time for Parliament and our main stakeholders to come forward with proposals to see what we are going to do with the universal service.</p>
      <p sl="en">A very concrete problem should be solved the day after tomorrow, because then the Council is going to accept the European Parliament’s amendment at its meeting concerning the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Parliament introduced an amendment on subtitling, improving accessibility for people with disabilities to audiovisual media services. I hope the Council will accept this and then the new policy will go also in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of digital signatures will gain in importance as secure electronic communications are developing between commercial and public service providers and users. The Commission will look at this issue in the follow-up to the European Electronic Signatures Directive and the e-government Action Plan, also bearing in mind people with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can just tell you in a very personal way that the various presidencies of the European Union have all held a congress or an exhibition – something official and public – to show how the results of the research have been put into practice. I have always thought that this was a very good example to be taken up in our e-government activities, which are there to be proposed by the Commission and the European Union, but they have to be implemented by local governments most of all and by regional and national governments. I have seen the enthusiasm with which regional and local governments in particular have taken up the results of our work to provide practical help for the disabled people living in their region.</p>

I really believe that the ageing of the population will first need a response from us on the societal level, but this response on the societal level is also an opportunity for the European industry, because if our industry gets the societal response from the policymakers, from those who are responsible in areas, in regions, in countries and at European level, then they can start to market systems, services and items for the elderly. I believe that this will not only help our society but also our economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is a turning point. It is also a question of growth and jobs, because, if we get it right, we can export systems on the societal level, as well as commercial items and services, outside of Europe. So I really believe that all those elements are working closely together for the betterment of our society and of our economy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Separation on electronic communications markets</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Speaking in Brussels, Commissioner Reding recently stressed the need for a 'European way of separation' of infrastructures and services in the EU telecommunications sector so as to ensure genuine competition with regard to fixed infrastructures. She recommends 'the legal separation of the network infrastructures from the service layers' as a basic tool for use by national legislators while not excluding full functional separation regarding the electronic communications markets.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission further specify what is meant by 'the European way'. Does it consider that the Greek telecommunications body fits into the category in which full separation would be possible in practice?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-321" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The honourable Member asked me what I mean by the expression ‘our European way of separation’. We currently have a framework for telecoms that provide regulatory tools or remedies to the NRAs in cases where markets are not competitive, and in its review of the framework the Commission will be looking at ways of strengthening the single market for telecom services.</p>
      <p sl="en">One possible innovation is to work more closely on remedies, because remedies are sometimes either not applied or not applied swiftly, which is the same problem. We have also analysed that one possible tool as a remedy could be functional separation, which means separating the network business of a dominant market player from the part of the business that provides a service to the end customers.</p>
      <p sl="en">This functional separation can provide the right incentive to providers of network services not to discriminate between customers for wholesale services. This can in turn mean that the conditions for real competition in the telecom markets are improved.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are not speaking here about forcing dominant players to sell off part of their businesses, as has happened in other parts of the world – for example in the United States with AT&amp;T. We would not like to go in that direction, and that is why I am talking about ‘the European way’. It would then be for each national regulator to assess the condition in its own Member State before considering such a remedy. This has already been done in Britain with Openreach, so that is one example which we have in that case.</p>
      <p sl="en">The honourable Member also asked about Greece. In the case of Greece it would then be the Greek regulator, on the basis of national law in line with the updated EU framework, to take account of competitive conditions and all other relevant factors in the Greek market, and then to propose – or not – such a remedy if he thought it to be necessary and in the interests of the Greek market.</p>

      <p sl="el">You are certainly making a huge effort in this sector. This regulatory uncertainty or, to put it another way, the high level of fragmentation is causing uncertainty for investment, it is causing uncertainty in competition, uncertainty in innovation and, of course, it is creating few jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">The honourable Member is absolutely right. For the time being we do not have a European market for telecoms. I think that has to be changed, because the only way for Europe to stay strong in matters of telecommunications – and Europe is strong, we are really one of the leading forces on the world market in this – is to get rid of 27 sometimes conflicting regulatory systems and come to one system which makes sense and which will also permit cross-border services and investments to take place, and enable us to have big European players which will work across several countries. So we are now working towards opening the market for international roaming. Parliament is going to decide on that tomorrow, and that is always a sign to show where we want to go in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will certainly come forward with a proposal for the reform of the e-communications package in order to get this European market to function, not to get rid of the national regulators – I think that we still need them because they know their market best – but in order to get not harmonisation, but logic in the remedies which they propose and which have to be applied swiftly so that there is a level playing field between the different markets and so that the cross-border activities of the industries can take place without being blocked by a lack of market opening in other markets.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question no 41 by Katerina Batzeli (H-0310/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European framework for the safer use of mobile telephones by adolescents and children</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The entry into force of the European Framework for the safer use of mobile telephones by adolescents and children, adopted on 6 February by leading EU undertakings in this sector, is welcomed as a first major step towards the protection of juveniles from certain dangers arising from the use of mobile telephones. It has been suggested that this approach should be included in the Commission communication Towards an EU Strategy on Rights of the Child (COM(2006)0367 final).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What are considered to be suitable measures to ensure that the European Framework is effectively implemented at national level and can be monitored by parents, teachers and those responsible for the supervision of juveniles? Given that the European Framework is based on a code of self-regulation by European companies, how will the Commission help to ensure its proper implementation in the Member States and assist in the evaluation of its effectiveness? What will be the responsibilities of the national regulatory authorities in drafting codes of self-regulation by February 2008 at the latest and monitoring their implementation? Does the Commission consider the future adoption of a Community legislative measure binding on the Member States and on companies to be advisable, given that self-regulation alone cannot be sufficient?</p>

      <p sl="en">I think that, if I have heard correctly, this question has already been partially answered by my colleague Mr Frattini who also spoke on this subject. The fact that he partially answered this question clearly shows that it is the Commission as a whole that is worried about the development of our society and the Commission as a whole that takes measures to move ahead in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 6 February this year, 15 leading European mobile operators and content providers united to sign a European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers. That is a voluntary agreement; it is a memorandum of understanding whereby the mobile industry, together with the GSM Association of Europe, agrees to monitor, publish and translate codes on their website, both those which already exist and those which will be adopted. These self-regulatory codes will then, for instance, help parents or grandparents or educators to understand what the problems for children using third-generation mobile phones might be. This agreement came out of the discussion in a high-level group that I convened, which included children’s organisations, consumer organisations and bodies for content classification, as well as regulatory bodies. The memorandum of understanding sets out a number of principles and requires signatories to work towards implementation through self-regulation at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we signed this together and we held a press conference, I said that I had confidence in the signatories. I will give them one year, until February or March next year, in order to implement that. Then we will come back to the subject and we will see if they have implemented it. If they implement it – fine – then maybe we will have discussions about possible corrections or future projects. If our expectations are not met, the Commission will then consider the introduction of specific measures.</p>

      <p sl="el">I thank the Commissioner for her reply. No one here doubts the Commission’s role on this important issue. I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions, rather to facilitate the debate. I think that this is a voluntary memorandum, as she herself said, and that the sector is expected to self-regulate. I would therefore say that the Commission should in essence know what it will be evaluating after February 2008.</p>
      <p sl="el">In other words, will it urge the Member States to proceed with certain common codes so that they can monitor this issue? Will the best practices of each Member State be codified and analysed?</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, what is the communications policy vis-à-vis parents who have no knowledge of this sector and what Community programmes can be used to inform them?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-327" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Thanks to the preparatory work it has done, the Commission has brought the mobile operators to take this initiative because the mobile operators understood very well that the Commission would not stand still and not do anything.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had seen in our recent surveys that there are many children who use mobile phones – in fact the majority of children over 12 years old. Most of all, camera phones and the location services can be a problem; for instance in the UK 10% of respondents say they had an unpleasant image taken of them, 17% of the kids feared that the image was posted online and forwarded to others, and 14% had experienced cyber-bulling. In Save the Children Finland’s survey, 30% of 7 to 15 year olds had experienced bullying through their mobile phones.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we know that there is a problem, but this does not mean that we have to push the parents now into saying ‘no more mobile phones for our kids’. That would be the wrong reaction. That is why it is so important that for instance the access for control for adult content should be available and that there be awareness-raising campaigns for parents and grandparents – who often buy mobile phones for their grandchildren – and for the children themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that the classification of commercial content according to national standards of decency and appropriateness is taking place, and that, as Commissioner Frattini has explained, the fight against illegal content on mobiles is really carried out. We decided no later than today in the Commission to establish this fight against illegal content. What we are speaking about here is not the illegal content as such, it is the dangers which can occur for children, and here the awareness-raising campaigns are the most important. We will monitor what is happening in that field, and we will monitor what the signatories of this memorandum of understanding have agreed upon. I have the European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers and children with me; I can hand it over to the Member and then she can see if this is taking place in her country, for instance, and I would be very grateful if she would inform me about that.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Situation in Vojvodina</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the past few years there have repeatedly been brutal attacks on members of minorities in Vojvodina; Serbian refugees have systematically been settled in villages inhabited by minorities in order to outnumber them; and EU funds, such as for training teachers in the minority languages, have not reached those for whom they were intended.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission has been monitoring the situation in Vojvodina very closely. We have urged the authorities to tackle inter-ethnic incidents promptly. We have encouraged the authorities to promote good inter-ethnic relations and to preserve Vojvodina’s multi-ethnic and multicultural model.</p>
      <p sl="en">As noted in the November 2006 progress report on Serbia, the inter-ethnic situation in Vojvodina has improved. There has been a decrease in the number of incidents. No significant incident has been reported in the first few months of 2007. The authorities have taken a number of measures concerning the official use of minority languages and scripts as well as the representation of minorities in the judiciary and police.</p>
      <p sl="en">Improvements have also been recorded concerning education. The importation of Albanian- and Hungarian-language text books for use in Vojvodina has been approved. A Hungarian-language teacher-training faculty has been set up in Subotica, which has been operational since October last year. These measures obviously need to be further developed and complemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have noted, however, that there has been no progress in the adoption of new legislation on the national councils for the minority groups, and problems persist in the area of information in minority languages. Therefore, we have requested that the Serbian authorities take further effective action on these matters.</p>

Secondly, I should like to know what is happening as regards the teacher training establishments that are supposed to be being set up, with EU funds, for the Romanians, Slovaks and Ruthenes, but which process seems to have come to a standstill.

      <p sl="en">As regards Mr Posselt’s supplementary question concerning EU assistance to Vojvodina and its relation to minority rights, while it is not possible to extrapolate exactly the total amount of aid given to the autonomous province of Vojvodina, the territory has received significant EU assistance, which has been directed to those needs to which Mr Posselt referred.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have based our economic assistance on the following considerations: history, i.e. post-war reconstruction, notably as regards the Sloboda Bridge; geography, through integrated border management; and the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Vojvodina is a relatively wealthy area compared with other areas of Serbia. Therefore, even though it occupies 25 % of the area of the republic and has 20 % of the population, Vojvodina has absorbed 36 % of the credit line that the EU has earmarked for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, it is clear that we are using this economic assistance for the purposes to which Mr Posselt referred, and I can assure him that this money is well used for the protection of minorities and their rights.</p>

We have raised these issues with the Serbian Government. Now, as the country has a new democratic government which is reform- and Europe-oriented, I expect that we have an even better chance of making our voice heard and ensuring that our concerns are taken into account in Serbia as regards Vojvodina’s position.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Constitution of Serbia contains detailed provisions concerning human rights and the protection of minorities. However, it contains some ambiguities in relation to the scope of territorial decentralisation. The new Serbian Parliament will have a key role in implementing the Constitution soundly, especially in enhancing the protection of minorities, as well as establishing forms of local self-government that are in line with European standards. In this respect it is certainly positive that, thanks to the revision of the electoral law, ethnic minority parties now have several seats in the new Serbian Parliament.</p>

One of these is the question whether or not it is a problem that the indigenous Hungarian minority in Vojvodina are in practice still considered war criminals. The law of Antigone is not honoured there, that is, they are not allowed to bury their dead or even to remember them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Or is it not a problem that there is no equity anywhere in the areas of employment, in privatisation, in state institutions, or education?

We have also discussed the issue with the Serbian authorities, who have underlined that they are committed to increasing the participation of people from national minorities in the police and judiciary, but they claim that there is often a lack of interest from qualified candidates. In my view, it is important that we continue this political pressure or political encouragement.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, once we solve the problems that have caused internally displaced persons to migrate, then we have better chances of avoiding the kinds of problems to which you referred. I am of course referring in particular to the issue of the Kosovo status talks. There must be a well-managed status settlement, and I am confident that, once we have that, there will be no destabilising effects on ethnically mixed areas such as Vojvodina. That is why we urge all those concerned to show a sense of responsibility. The Commission’s firm view is that no parallel can be drawn between Kosovo and Vojvodina.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions. The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government. The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah Gül, to the office of President.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What are the Commission's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU? The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, has stated that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-à-vis the military, stressing that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria. Does the Commission believe that such interventions by the military are consistent with the requirements of the Community acquis and what impact could they have on the country's accession procedure? Can any further response from the Commission be expected if developments are not compatible with the democratic principles of the EU?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-341" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Turkish Government respected the ruling of the Constitutional Court and took the measures to implement it. This was important for the political stability of the country, regardless of the events that led to the ruling.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end of political stability, the majority party submitted to the Grand National Assembly a proposal to hold early general elections. Subsequently, the Grand National Assembly agreed by a broad majority that the early parliamentary elections would be held on 22 July 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission expects that the parliamentary, and subsequent presidential, elections will be carried out democratically in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability. As regards the role of the military, I have often said that I have a high regard for the Turkish armed forces in the fulfilment of their duties of defending their country and contributing to international peace, but, as I stated after the statement by the Chief of Staff at the end of April, the military must leave the remit of democratic decision-making to the democratically-elected bodies of Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be self-evident that if any country wants to join the European Union it should respect all democratic principles, including ensuring democratic leadership of civil military relations, and, in my view, this is fully compatible with secular democracy, or democratic secularism, which is anchored in the Turkish Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once the new Parliament is elected and a new government takes office, it will be crucial for Turkey to revitalise and relaunch fully the legislative work and implementation of the reforms that enhance the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in the country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you for this very important question, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. In fact, I talk a lot with the Turkish Government – some people in Europe think that it is too much! But in times of the political or constitutional crises which Turkey has undergone and, to my mind, is going through during this crisis phase, it is particularly important that we maintain a channel of communication and discuss intensively with the Turkish Government and with all the relevant players in Turkish society in order to make clear what the expectations of the European Union are, if and when Turkey wants to become a member of the European Union. Of course, democratic leadership of civil and military relations is one of these cornerstones.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commission stated very clearly in early May – after my statement concerning the political intervention of the Turkish military in the tense situation – that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the supremacy of democratic, civilian power over the military. If a country wants to become a member of the Union, it needs to respect these principles. This is the core of the Copenhagen criteria for EU accession. This has been made very clear to the Turkish Government and those involved in politics in Turkey, as well as through the Turkish media to the Turkish citizens. I do not think that a higher volume helps. Instead we need clarity and precision and, concerning our statement, it cannot get any clearer than our statement of 2 May.</p>

      <p sl="en">I must say that, as a Commissioner, as I said before, I do not believe in high-volume or megaphone diplomacy. I believe in clarity, precision and consistency. In this regard I think we do not disagree with the honourable Member, because, as I said before, we have repeatedly underlined the importance of the supremacy of democratic civilian power over the military. At the same time it is also important that we keep the accession negotiations alive and we make practical progress with them, because what the nationalists really want in Turkey is to cut the accession negotiations. I do not want to give this present to the nationalists of Turkey. It is much better to strive towards the EU accession of Turkey, keep the accession process alive and move towards the shared objective, because that is the way for Turkey to become a more European, more democratic country, where the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards your reference to the Constitutional Court, I understand the reasoning of your question and we have also taken note of the ruling which was issued by the Constitutional Court. I would like to quote what was said on 2 May by the College of Commissioners when we discussed this matter and we made our position clear to the Turkish Government and Turkish public. We said, ‘regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling, this legal decision by the Constitutional Court should now be respected by all parties, because the respect of state institutions is essential to ensure political stability’. That is rather clear language.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also stated that, ‘under these circumstances, the European Commission welcomes the announcement of holding new parliamentary elections soon in order to ensure political stability and democratic development in Turkey’. Again, it cannot get any clearer than that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this discussion on the recent dispute between Russia and Estonia. Let me state right away that this is not a human rights issue. The moving of the bronze soldier statue in Tallinn and the exhumation of the soldiers’ graves were carried out with full respect for Estonia’s international obligations, notably under the Geneva Convention with regard to war graves. However, I am aware of the sensitivity of this matter, which touches on the interpretation of history.</p>
      <p sl="en">While there have been concerns in Russia about this, we made it clear to Russia at the last summit that these concerns should be addressed through dialogue rather than through ‘megaphone diplomacy’. We regret that the demonstrations that took place in Estonia turned into looting and riots. There is the right to demonstrate, which emanates clearly from freedom of expression. However, the fact that it led to a siege in front of the Estonian Embassy in Moscow was unacceptable. We have made clear our views about this and a demarche was conducted in Moscow immediately to remind Russia of its obligations under the Vienna Conventions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are concerned about cyber-attacks against official Estonian internet sites. These need to be properly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. We remind Russia of our joint commitment to cooperate in fighting cybercrime both in the context of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice and by acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Today the Commission adopted a communication on cybercrimes and we will certainly work on its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also following closely the situation regarding trade between Russia and Estonia. There have been calls in Russia for trade boycotts of Estonian goods and services and restrictions on transport operations. At one point restrictions were imposed on trucks crossing the bridge over the Narva River and oil shipments through Estonia were reduced. Our latest information is that expert talks took place today concerning the bridge and that oil shipments through Estonia have resumed. We shall continue to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that this issue has now passed its climax and that emotions will subside. We discussed it at the EU-Russia summit in Samara and it was also raised at the press conference. President Putin even acknowledged that there might have been some overreaction on the Russian side and he regretted that the Estonian Ambassador had to leave Moscow. I fully support the Presidency in calling for a ‘dispassionate dialogue on the matter’, addressing the problems ‘in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Samara summit took place at a critical time in EU-Russia relations. The discussions were open and frank and the media reports have, of course, highlighted the areas of disagreement between us. I think it was highly important that we had this frank discussion: we have to talk to each other because Russia is and remains a strategic partner and an important neighbour. At the same time, we also have to talk frankly to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU side placed considerable emphasis, as Mr Barroso in particular knows, on the importance of the respect for democracy and human rights, notably in the run-up to elections. The detention of Garry Kasparov at Moscow airport, preventing him from attending a demonstration in Samara to coincide with the summit, was particularly regrettable and was very clearly addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let me stress that there are also a number of positive issues to note from the summit. I would say that the picture of the summit was mixed.</p>
      <p sl="en">First and most importantly, Russia was left in no doubt of the importance we attach to EU solidarity in our relations with Russia. Secondly, the summit confirmed that the EU and Russia see eye-to-eye on the underlying necessity of constructing a strong EU-Russia strategic partnership in the future. Thirdly, both the EU and Russia recognise that our economic and trading links in particular are larger and more intense than ever. Indeed, Russia is our third trading partner and we are their number one trading partner. We are working together for Russia’s accession to the WTO this year, which will also see the signature of the Siberian overflight agreement, most probably in November. Fourthly, the summit also registered that, despite our difficulties, cooperation is proceeding well in many areas covered by the four common space roadmaps agreed in 2005. For instance the agreement on facilitation of visas and readmission will come into force on 1 June 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of education, we have the European studies centre in Moscow, where there are hundreds of students who study European law. Europe attracts great attention from the students. There are questions such as the early alert system for energy, which Russia agreed to in principle and which we now have to work on, and finally a sort of dialogue on the investment climate and on investment in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, as I have said, I do not think the picture is black and white: there is a full spectrum of different colours, from warm to cold shades.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I fully agree with the Commissioner’s statement that we do not have to look at the picture in black and white, but unfortunately the black and white situation was forced on us and was forced on one Member State by its big neighbour.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the Presidency for their convincing demonstration of solidarity in Samara. I think the clear statement by the President of the Commission to the Russian President that Estonia or Poland are considered as equally important members of the Union as Portugal or Germany should be considered a key message. I think the most important thing in the current situation was to make our counterparts understand what solidarity means for the Union, which is based on common values.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the motion for a resolution on Estonia states, attacks targeted at one of the smallest Member States are considered a test case for the solidarity of the EU as a whole, and all the major political groups have agreed on the text of the joint motion for a resolution on Estonia.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think there are some issues which you need to address collectively in future. It is inadmissible to interfere brutally in the internal affairs of any State, especially a small one. There is a crucial difference between two former totalitarian states. New democratic Germany made it the basic principle of its foreign policy never to threaten any of its neighbours, and this has contributed to a very significant extent to a positive change in post-war Europe. I think we need to act together to help Russia take a similar stand regarding its past imperialist deeds and help it to come to similar conclusions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to make two preliminary observations. I agree entirely with the Commissioner when he talks about a strategic partnership and the value of one, and states that we must continue the dialogue with Russia and must see what we can get out of it on the basis of our own principles and values.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, I am a Dutchman. I was not born in Eastern Europe. I grew up in freedom and have always lived in it. I think it is extremely important for me as a representative of what we could call an ‘old’ Member State to comment on what has happened to Estonia and the way in which Russia has treated it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also important to note that things related to the past are always sensitive, for us as much as for others. One has to tread carefully. I am a historian myself, and I know how dangerous it is if too much history is injected in politics. Although I always counsel in favour of exercising a certain level of self-restraint, my group has still expressed its solidarity with Estonia, and this must also be the basis for the European attitude in the conflict that has come about between Estonia and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact that this conflict affects not only Russia, but the entire European Union was hammered home by the Commission President, Mr Barroso, in Samara. The European Union has not attempted to trivialise the conflict. Russia’s reaction was inappropriate and unacceptable. European governments and members of parliament have tried to interfere in the domestic affairs of an EU Member State, and this is outrageous.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Add to this the fact that the Russian authorities have done nothing to protect the functioning of the Estonian embassy in Moscow, as a result of which the conflict ended up, to all intents and purposes, being a diplomatic crisis. As I see it – and this is also worded well in the resolution – the Russian authorities, but perhaps we too, would do well to replace the hostile rhetoric by an attempt to contribute to a dialogue, not least between the communities in the countries in question, namely Estonia and Latvia, and not to drive things to a head, because this dialogue is also needed to create relations within those countries that match European values.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I hope that the message of dialogue, the message of talking about the future, not only about the past, will also be put across in Moscow.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to touch on two topics in recent Estonian-Russian relations, firstly the cyber war and secondly the disinformation that has been engaged in by President Putin.</p>
      <p sl="et">Firstly, even after all of the declarations of support Estonia has received, Russia has not taken any steps to end the systematic cyber attacks on Estonia’s official information and communication channels and on the web pages of the Estonian Government. The propaganda attacks on the Internet and via mobile messages include calls to violence and armed resistance. These messages are even distributed on television and through other media. Estonia is particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, since it has an e-cabinet and e-government and this year had the first e-elections.</p>
      <p sl="et">The cyber attacks taking place in Estonia should serve as a warning to the whole of Europe. In the 21st century this danger threatens all countries. We must seriously consider how to protect ourselves, and we must do this together. This is the first ‘cyber war’ in history, and it is clearly aimed at hindering the functioning of a sovereign state of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="et">Secondly, at an official press conference in Samara, at which the press of the whole world was represented, the Russian President said the following words, and I quote: ‘It was not just that demonstrators were dispersed in Tallinn. A demonstrator was killed there. Moreover, it is not even the fact that an accident happened that is the issue,’ Putin claimed, ‘We are concerned by something else, by the fact that the person in question did not receive any help when he was injured.’ According to Putin, Ganin died in the presence of the police.</p>
      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, this is intentional disinformation. Indeed, 20-year-old Dmitri Ganin was fatally injured in the course of the rioting, but criminal proceedings were initiated in connection with Dmitri’s death, and these showed that his death was not connected with the police activity in keeping the peace in Tallinn. At approximately midnight on 27 April, the police found Dmitri, who had suffered a stab wound, and called an ambulance for him at 12.26 a.m. The ambulance set off one minute later and reached the scene at 12.32 a.m., that is to say five minutes later. Dmitri was hospitalised at 12.51 a.m. He was operated on, and he died in the hospital at 2.00 a.m. I emphasise once again: the ambulance arrived five minutes after being called by the police, and thus Dmitri did not die in the presence of the police, but instead in hospital.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the recent tensions with Russia over trade discrimination against Poland and Russia’s interference in the internal affairs of independent Estonia provided what is probably the best possible demonstration of the actual mechanisms and forces underpinning European cooperation in the area of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It was our moral duty to show solidarity with Estonia, but such solidarity is also in our best political interests. Recent incidents between the Union and Russia amounted to a substantial investment in the future of the European Union, one that is far more significant than further institutional changes.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to distinguish between the Russian-speaking people in Estonia and Russian policy. The Russian-speaking people in Estonia have the same civil and human rights as us, but the problems and differences of opinion do not entitle Russia to interfere in Estonia’s affairs, such as demanding that the Estonian Government should resign. No one believes that the authorities in Moscow could not have prevented the disruption and the violence against the Estonian Ambassador and the embassy staff there when, just as the Commissioner said, opposition activists were stopped from travelling to the demonstration at Samara. The row over the statue has brought to light two different interpretations of history. It is true that the Red Army had a major role in liberating Europe from Nazism, but it is also true that the same army after the war became an army of occupation in Estonia and in many other countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The events have shown clearly how poorly the Russian-speaking population has integrated into Estonian society. It is the Estonian Government’s and society’s job, and I know that it is not always an easy one, to find a constructive way to resolve these problems. The police have an obligation to keep order, but accusations that the police have acted disproportionately harshly need to be investigated impartially and openly. Russia seems to find it hard to understand that Estonia and the other Baltic countries are actually sovereign states. We have to show Estonia solidarity. The Member States of the European Union must help Estonia to find out who or what started the attacks on Estonian authority websites.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left naturally regrets the disproportionate reactions in Russia, and we naturally demand that Russia fulfil its international commitments under the Vienna Convention.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That being said, the following must also be stated: no party is served by an escalation of the conflict, as may result from certain actions or simplistic resolutions and statements. Bridge-building and dialogue between parties is better than the setting up of walls and barriers. It is also indisputable that the discrimination and restriction of civil rights to which the Russian-speaking population of Estonia is exposed constitute the biggest breeding ground for conflicts. Responsibility for the conflict we are now discussing also resides with the Estonian Government, which does not respect the Russian-speaking population’s civil rights. It is responsible for the fact that, before the monument was moved, no dialogue was conducted with the residents of Tallinn and for the fact that no account was taken of the monument’s significance for a huge number of people as an important memorial to all those who lost their lives in the fight against Nazism and Fascism.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Other regrettable factors are the escalation of the conflict, which was a reaction to the Estonian authorities not allowing peaceful demonstrations, and the further escalation, which was a consequence of the action taken by the Estonian police against the demonstrators. The Estonian action of removing an anti-Nazi memorial and the remains of soldiers who died in the war against Hitler’s troops is seen as a provocation against all those who think that the fight against Nazism should be remembered in the future. No one is entitled to re-write history, and political views should not prevent serious analysis, and understanding, of how conflicts arise. It is only through such analysis and understanding that we shall be able to resolve conflicts in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I cannot agree with the last speaker in her interpretation of moving a war memorial to a military cemetery. It seems to me that this is entirely the correct procedure. It is the right of the Estonian Government to make that decision, and this was used as a pretext, not, Commissioner, as you said, for a dispute between Russia and Estonia, but for a dispute between Russia and the EU. Commission President Barroso made the point extremely eloquently at Samara that we express our total solidarity with Estonia – as well as with Poland, with the Czech Republic and, indeed, with my own country, whose Ambassador has also been harassed by Nashi, an organisation from which President Putin does very little to dissociate himself.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are told constantly that we have to de-escalate the situation, which we did not create. In your reply, Commissioner, I wonder whether you can dwell on the WTO negotiations to which you referred. Is it possible that we can continue to negotiate entry with a country which apparently appears to be implicated in the disruption of electronic communications – as Mr Savi has just explained – with the banking system, with our own security? Surely a very clear message has to be sent to President Putin that of course we want to continue these negotiations, but we cannot do so until the cyber-attacks cease.</p>

      <p sl="et">I will not dwell on the events that took place in Tallinn, which are spelled out in detail in the resolution, but I would like to emphasise the manner in which Russia has misrepresented the entire course of events for propaganda purposes. As my fellow Member, Mr Savi, has already noted regarding the death of the only young man to lose his life, would-be eyewitnesses spread in Tallinn the very next morning a version of the story according to which he had died in front of the Drama Theatre from blows inflicted by police truncheons. Since the location was identified incorrectly and the death was in fact caused by a stab wound, the Moscow version gradually dropped the reference to police blame, and President Putin claimed to the leaders of the European Union gathered in Samara that an ambulance had deliberately not come to assist the victim. I directly checked the facts on Sunday evening, when I spoke to the Minister of the Interior, who said that the ambulance had arrived at the scene within five minutes.</p>
      <p sl="et">Thus, this lie has twice been refuted in this House, yet I have once again had to emphasise the facts, because tomorrow spurious films are likely be in circulation here in this building.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention the historical background of the recent riots and violent demonstrations in Estonia. The European Union should understand that during the 50 years of Soviet occupation the Communist regime committed multiple crimes against the populations of the Baltic States. It moved hundreds of thousands of working migrants to the territories of these occupied, former sovereign states, which were members of the League of Nations, and created a real threat that Estonians and Latvians might become minorities in their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following immense pressure from the international community, including the European institutions, Estonia and Latvia agreed to integrate those hundreds of thousands of non-citizens into their societies. However, integration is a two-way process, and the recent developments in Estonia show that there are reverse tendencies. The sentiments of Soviet times have been replaced by Russia’s new imperialistic approach. Especially alarming is the fact that the younger generation, on which the most hopes for integration and loyalty have been placed, was at the centre of the recent violent events in Estonia, and this must give us some food for thought.</p>

The Baltic States are now also proud, independent EU Member States and it is right and proper that the EU and NATO, which they have joined, should show total solidarity when Russia attempts to bully the smallest of them – Estonia – over what is entirely a sovereign internal matter of that newly independent republic.</p>

The recent EU-Russia summit in Samara resulted in a change in our mutual relationship, as the existence of solidarity within the Union became apparent to the new Member States. Thanks are due to the President of the Council and the President of the Commission for this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It may be deemed disappointing that no progress was achieved in the talks. Nonetheless, the Samara summit should be regarded in a positive light. This is because the development of relations between the Union and Russia is conditional on Russia’s respect for the sovereignty of individual Member States of the Union and on Russia abandoning tactics that involve exerting political pressure through economic instruments or the use of information technology.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the Russian authorities have failed to take this on board. The cyber-attacks on Estonia have not ceased, and the embargo on Polish meat is still in place. The trail left by Alexander Litvinienko’s murderers leads to Moscow. All the Union can do is to maintain pressure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We cannot attempt to understand contemporary Russia without considering its attitude to the past.

The previous debates in Parliament on this subject indicate that not everyone understands why certain people have reacted so violently. Allow me, therefore, to explain.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As early as at the time of his appointment as President, Mr Putin indicated that he would do everything he could to restore to Russia its former military strength and the power that he believes is Russia’s due. If I remember correctly, only one newspaper – a French one – directly picked up on the signals from Russia. Other media remained unaware of them. Those of us who speak Russian and who have experience of living close to, or under the thumb of, Russia did, however, understand. Over the years, it has, however, become ever clearer that Russia is developing in the wrong direction when it comes to human rights, media independence and political freedom. Otto von Habsburg, one of Europe’s most respected political figures, described it as the route back to the time of Stalin. He is now 95 years old. He has a perspective on things, and he remembers. Others appear to have forgotten, however. In the European Parliament, too, there are Members who appear to have forgotten the trials that had to be endured by the Eastern European countries on their way to freedom, independence and autonomy. All the threats and boycotts, the interference in other countries’ internal affairs and the blackmail involving withheld energy supplies appear to have been forgotten. A number of these events took place quite recently and are happening right now in some of the countries I would designate as the new Europe.</p>

That was fine support for the Member States, the new Member States, and especially Estonia, but even for those politicians who have now lost their rose-coloured spectacles regarding relations with Russia it is vital to understand that attempts will continue to take place to demonstrate that for Russia there still exists the real old Europe and the territories close to its borderland, which, in Russia’s view, have temporarily, under the influence of various events, accidentally become part of the European Union. At the same time there will be new tests of the strength of the European Union’s unity, and tests of new virtual weapons, which in modern society can do enormous harm. So the question is whether the European Union will wait until it runs into more problems with one of the European Union’s ex-Soviet bloc Member States, or whether it will be able to urge upon Russia the requirements that any state must fulfil if it wants to become a democratic and prospective member of a partnership. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is particularly important for Europe not only to display solidarity but also to acknowledge the true reasons for the conflicts that occurred in Estonia. Europe absolutely must understand that in Estonia there was a clash between Western democracy and the old Soviet totalitarian ideologies. In recognising this, Europe must unfalteringly reject the historical interpretations of the totalitarian USSR era. Europe must promote the removal of USSR symbols that offend the inhabitants of nations that were enslaved by the USSR. Europe must participate in the renewal of historical truth in the occupied Baltic States and elsewhere in eastern Europe. This might be a precondition for the reconciliation of representatives of differing ideologies and for future integration in the former Soviet-occupied territories. This is also a joint problem for the whole of Europe. I would like in particular to stress that the European Parliament ought from now on to be an active participant in achieving these goals of truth and the rule of law. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this discussion has clearly shown that the key word is ‘solidarity’. I should like to thank a number of Members for their words of thanks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso in particular could not have been clearer on this issue. Many of you know what he said. His meaning was that aggression against one Member State – in this case Estonia – represents aggression against the whole European Union. This was a very strong statement and it also showed that divide et impera politics cannot work if Europe speaks with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="en">These were the main issues and main lessons of these proceedings. These questions took some considerable time in the discussions in our meeting. We emphasised again and again that we are working as an EU of 27 Member States and that solidarity will be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">On WTO accession, both sides at Samara recognised that our economic and trading links are larger and more intensive than ever and it was encouraging to hear from the Russian side that they intend to accelerate the process of their accession to the WTO. It is encouraging because it is in our interests to bind Russia into a rules-based system where it can then be held to account. This is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">On cyber-attacks, it is now up to the Council to work on the Commission communication where we have added a specific paragraph on cyber-terrorism. I can see there is generally much agreement in this House on how important it is to work on this question of solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0130/2007) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Union - 2005 (2006/2217(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-375" speaker_id="1263" name="Elmar Brok" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are, today, discussing the Council’s report on the CFSP in the Council’s absence, I am all the more grateful to the Commission, and to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for being present with us. It certainly says something about this House that the only official report produced on the Common Foreign and Security Policy ends up being discussed at night.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that, in past years, and specifically in the period under consideration here, cooperation with the Commission on the Common Foreign and Security Policy went extraordinarily well, as indeed it did with the Council in many areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over this time, we made considerable progress in developing the neighbourhood policy and on policy relating to the Balkans; we also became more able to take up positions in relation to the area of security and defence policy, so that the number of functions assumed by the European Union today would have been scarcely imaginable five years ago. It is for this reason that the European Union’s present and unprecedented ability – whether in the Middle East or in relation to Iran – to recruit other countries to our own strategy, which combines prevention, civil crisis management and military capacity, rather than relying on military strength alone, which I will sum up as the idea of the European Union’s ‘soft power’ as a global standard, must be accounted a triumph.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we have to ask ourselves whether, despite the progress we have made, we are able to fully meet the challenges we face, I ask you to bear with me as I observe that it is in the fields covered by the Foreign and Security Policy that it is vital, even to our own continued existence, that the Constitutional Treaty become a reality, and so it is with this issue in mind, as also in these present days and weeks in which we are moving towards the next Intergovernmental Conference, that we must make clear that this is one of the indispensable components of the Constitutional Treaty, for what we and the Commission agree on is the need for us to put our capacities in more coherent order.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it important that we take certain steps even before the event; for example, I would encourage the Commission to push through the expansion of its delegations, which are present in 120 countries, in such a way that the other institutions can avail themselves of their services even before the External Service for which provision is made in the Constitutional Treaty, is in place. Since the Council is not present and cannot hear what is being said, I can also say that this would be a splendid opportunity to demonstrate that such an External Service should, both now and in the future, come under the authority of the Commission, and that it does not need to be an independent institution. We will acquire all the more capacity to act if, on this front, we adopt even now the sensible practice of the fait accompli.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is represented in 120 countries by Commission delegations, and it is the biggest trading power in the world, accounting for 20% of global trade; its gross domestic product is greater than that of the United States of America – not per capita, it must be admitted, but overall – and, if we succeed in putting that into political language, language, moreover, that speaks of a position founded less on military might alone than on ‘soft power’, then we can be in a position to equip the trans-Atlantic alliance for action, and to do so, moreover, on an equal footing, thereby exercising influence as equal partners, as we recently did with the Trans-Atlantic Economic Agreement, which signifies for us an important forward step in the continuation of relations with the United States, which is, and will continue to be in future, our ally and partner. We cannot remain equidistant from Russia and America, for, on the contrary, the USA are, in terms of their values, our primary partner, and that has to be made quite clear when talking of these things in order to prevent misunderstandings arising concerning them.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">When matters such as these are in hand, whether one agrees or not with the current government’s policies becomes a secondary consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, though, it has to be clear to us that we can achieve this level of influence only if we act together. Solidarity also means solidarity with the outside world. I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the German Presidency of the Council as a whole for joining together with the Commission in order to demonstrate that in Samara, where they really did not waste any time in making it plain that they would not allow themselves to be divided. While we must not allow the Americans to divide us into the ‘old’ Europe and the ‘new’, nor must we allow our neighbour to the East to think that the quality of security differs from one region to another and that it can have more influence over some than over others. Every state in Europe and throughout the world must be free to decide for itself to which alliance and which community it wishes to belong, and no neighbour, as big as it may be, must try to influence it to change its mind; that idea – that every country takes for itself the decision as to which community it wants to belong to – is at the heart of the 1975 Helsinki Accords. Even so, it has to be clear to us just how important this great neighbour is to us as regards energy and in relation to other issues too, and that is why we have to ensure that the strategic partnership with Russia is built on, for I would prefer to see a democratic Russia of that sort on our side rather than on that of Iran.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss Mr Brok’s report with you all, even though we are doing it at a time of night when we might rather be in bed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Common Foreign and Security Policy is a crucially important element in the EU’s foreign policy, and one in which the treaties require that the Commission be fully involved, participating in debates at every level within the Council’s structures, being a permanent member of the troika, and managing and implementing the CFSP’s budget. Through all the measures under the first pillar, we also help to work towards the European Union’s foreign policy goals, and it is of vital importance to us that the EU should have at its disposal a fully integrated foreign policy drawing not only on the Common Foreign and Security Policy but also on the Community dimension and hence on the measures taken by the Member States. We seek to be what one might describe as the cogs in a well-oiled machine.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would now like to pick up some of the issues raised in this very comprehensive report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where the foreign policy dimension of the constitutional treaty is concerned, I, too, take the view that its implementation would make the CFSP more efficient, more coherent and more visible, but we should not draw from that the conclusion that things cannot be improved in the interim or that they have not been.</p>
      <p sl="de">What counts in this context is what happens on the ground and what emerges from it, and in this respect there have been considerable improvements; only recently, we have been able to satisfy ourselves that cooperation between the Council, the Member States and the Commission had improved, as had the harmonisation of our action and measures in preparing a solution to the issue of the status of Kosovo, the promotion of the rule of law in Afghanistan through greater efforts towards measures in the areas of policing and the justice system, where policing falls within the remit of the Council and of its secretariat, while we deal with the justice system and military action is taken under NATO auspices. One might also cite as example the support for the Middle East peace process, with the EU having sent a mission to assist with border controls at the Rafah crossing point, support for the reform of the security sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo and also the funding of the peacekeeping operations in Somalia and the Sudan through the Peace Facility for Africa, not to mention the observation and monitoring operation in Aceh.</p>
      <p sl="de">All these cost-intensive, but politically very important undertakings make it necessary that we should, in order to achieve our objectives, draw the necessary resources not only from the budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy but also from the Community instruments, including the new stability instrument. I would like to add that the stability instrument is showing itself to be very flexible in this respect, in that it enables us to respond to crises quickly and to build up the necessary capacities.</p>
      <p sl="de">By cooperating in crisis situations and in meeting other foreign policy challenges, we are in fact already preparing the way for the implementation of the foreign policy provisions in the constitutional treaty, thereby also enhancing the European Union’s role in the world, which is what its citizens want, and this is also, quite rightly, stressed in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament, too, plays a very considerable part in the EU’s foreign policy, and it is for that reason that I attach great importance to our regular exchanges with you, whether in meetings of the plenary or of your committees, in which we should never lose sight of the common challenge that we face, that of making our influence more effectively felt throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">As is rightly emphasised in the report, it is equally important that the Common Foreign and Security Policy be properly funded, and so the funds for the new financial period were topped up to a considerable degree, particularly in comparison to other policy areas. Turning to the 2007 Budget, we all know that 2007 will be an extraordinary year in terms of the demands that will be made on the Budget, the two most important of which will be, without a doubt, Kosovo and the peace process in the Middle East. In Kosovo, as soon as we have managed to secure agreement on its final status and the UN Security Council in New York has adopted a resolution, a major – perhaps even the biggest yet – ESDP operation will be set in motion, and the Commission and the Council are already working hard on preparing it. As regards the peace process in the Middle East, we have to ensure that the aid to the Palestinian people is maintained.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the event of additional resources being required for the CFSP budget, we will have to work with your House to find a suitable solution, taking into account the need to respond to unforeseen crises and emergencies in other foreign policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I could, right now, go into the individual issues, but I do think you would rather I broke off for the moment now and then answered a few specific questions after the debate.</p>

    <intervention id="2-377" speaker_id="28548" name="Antonis Samaras" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to express our satisfaction at the reinforcement of the Common Foreign and Security Policy chapter with almost EUR 1 800 million for the period 2007-2013, which almost triples the funding for the previous seven years.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, we consider that, for precisely this reason, this positive development needs to be accompanied by strengthened measures for parliamentary control and improved cooperation between our committee and the Council, as provided for in Article 28 of the Treaty on European Union. Consequently, I am obliged to condemn this evening’s unwarranted absence of the Council, which sends us a very negative message.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our position is clear; we cannot accept annual reports from the Council limited solely to an ex-post description of CFSP activities. With the signature of the new interinstitutional agreement, the moment has now come for the Council to give us information before it takes its final decisions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Such substantial financial information was only given to us recently for Kosovo by the competent German ambassador and I must welcome the initiative of the ambassador in question, in the hope that this improvement will now continue on a regular basis.</p>
      <p sl="el">Two other points: we are worried that it has so far been almost impossible to assess so-called ‘mixed CFSP actions’ entailing expenditure resulting from both civilian actions and actions with military and defence implications and, secondly, I wish to emphasise that we consider it necessary for the European Union Special Representatives to fall under the CFSP budget and, therefore, that there is a need to establish criteria for their appointment and evaluation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">on. – Mr President, Mr Brok’s report concerns the year 2005, but we are obviously here today to discuss the future of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. What form will it take?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Clearly, if the European Union is to be an active force for international peace, stabilisation and safety, it must have the relevant tools at its disposal, in the form of appropriate political and social institutions. These tools are always underlain by the political will of the Member States or by the lack of any such will. Whether or not we have more Europe now and in the future will depend on the will of Europe’s political leaders. Similarly, the Common Foreign and Security Policy is underlain by our leaders’ political will. What, therefore, are the challenges facing our leaders in the context of the CFSP and the ESDP?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, regardless of the eventual outcome of the reform of the treaties, I believe that consideration of the Constitutional Treaty’s provisions relating directly or indirectly to the CFSP should begin as part of the reform process. The European Union should then be endowed with a legal personality and its pillar-based structure done away with. A new entity should be created, the so-called European Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a European External Action Service should be set up.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The general principle of unanimity in the area of CFSP should be retained, whilst also extending the scope of qualified majority voting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is very important to introduce a solidarity clause to apply in the case of a terrorist threat or act, and to retain the principle of mutual assistance in cases of armed aggression on the territory of any of the Member States (the principle laid down in Article 1(41) of the Constitutional Treaty).</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, it is essential for structural cooperation to remain within the scope of missions whilst at the same time doing away with their exclusive nature. A broader list of Petersberg tasks should be included in the Treaty too. The European Defence Agency should be strengthened by treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the effectiveness of peace missions should be ensured. I refer not only to current missions to Bosnia and Lebanon but also to the forthcoming mission to Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, an energy solidarity clause should be included in the new Treaty. This would be a fitting response to the threats to energy security that are having an ever-greater impact on our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorse Mr Brok’s report, even though our views differ as regards certain aspects of concrete political measures; for example, we take the view that the concerns and fears felt in some of the European Union’s Member States about the stationing of the American anti-missile system triggering a new round of the arms race should be voiced. I might add that we Social Democrats are extremely pleased to note that some of the same questions that we have about this system are now also being raised in the US Congress’ House of Representatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why, though, are we supporting your report? We support it because it is presented in a quite specific situation and was endorsed by a broad majority in the committee, and the situation in which we find ourselves is the final stretch leading to the creation of a new treaty basis for the European Union and for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We social democrats want that sort of progress. I hope you will excuse my bluntness when I say that it may well turn out, tomorrow, that there will be more determined backing for it from our ranks than there will be from elements within your own group.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is when we are discussing matters such as these that someone should speak out about what it is all about; you were right to do just that, and I want to underline once more what you said. The day will come when it will no longer affect those of us who sit here, but it may well be that it will affect our grandchildren, who will, one day, read in their history books that, in 2007, Europeans once again had an opportunity to help determine the fate of the world, that they threw the chance away, and influence over the world was thereafter shared out between the United States and China.</p>
      <p sl="de">If that is not to happen, then this House, in the situation in which we find ourselves, must endorse this report and give its backing to these measures, many of which Mr Klich has enumerated, and I agree with his description of them, which should, by tomorrow, be the common position of the great majority in this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will probably be amazed that my own group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, is another that not only welcomes the Brok report, but positively endorses it. I am not only interested but also overjoyed to note Mr Brok’s newly-discovered passion for ‘soft power’, which is something else in which I can rejoice while looking forward with keen anticipation to seeing to what degree he transposes that onto the European Union’s enlargement policy in relation not only to the Western Balkans but also to Turkey. I do not propose to go into that in any greater depth right now, but what can certainly not be acceptable any longer is the Council’s attitude towards this House where the CFSP and the ESDP are concerned, for it informs us at some point after the event depending on what it feels like doing and how it assesses the situation, a practice that comes in for justified criticism and must be changed. It has to be said too, though, that what has hitherto gone under the name of Common Foreign and Security Policy does not often merit the name that it bears.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me try to show that by reference to the example of Kosovo. Over recent years, the Member States of the European Union have sent many soldiers and aid workers, together with a lot of money, to the crisis-torn regions and are now planning to be involved with policing on a broad scale and to have a civil presence too. Considering not only the quality, but also the quantity, of the services we provide together, one might think that the European Union had an unambiguous, unitary and common Kosovo policy to follow, but – as we are all aware – the reality is somewhat different, even though the issue has already been discussed at the level of the UN Security Council, and the question arises as to whether we must once more wait for the Americans to intervene, or whether we are in a position to resolve the problem ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for once, today, I would like to start with the points on which we are in agreement. It is an impertinence to have this debate held at a time such as this. The subject-matter really is far too important for that, and – as the report states with surprising clarity, very much so in paragraphs 41, 42 and 43, and also in many others – Parliament has no real control over the European Union’s military policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council really should get round to taking note of the very real and complete unity that prevails within this House on this point. We want parliament to monitor what is going on, and we also want it to be consulted on military decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me now, though, for fear that I should ladle consensus sauce over this report, list the main points on which we disagree. As Mr Brok said earlier, it really is the constitutional treaty that is at the heart of all this, and, as the Commissioner said, it really will bring in real ‘advances’ in terms of military policy. It is for precisely that reason, among others, that we repudiate this constitutional treaty, and hope that such passages as Article I-41 (3) will no longer feature in the fundamental treaty that is now being planned, although I am not very confident on that score. It really does look as if we are going to end up with practically the same treaty, but no longer under the name of ‘Constitutional Treaty’; instead, it will be adopted by the various governments under another form.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say something about certain points within this report. The centrality of structural cooperation is set out in very clear terms. Yes, it really is central – if you want the European Union to be a military power. We do not, and so we do not want this structured cooperation either, and there are very clear references to the Athena machinery whereby devious means are used to fund military actions by the European Union; for example, through what are termed ‘returns’ from the European Development Fund, and that we regard as a scandal. This sort of gamesmanship really does need to have a stop put to it, and the European Union really must not be allowed to become a military power.</p>

The parts that amused me the most were those calling for a foreign policy to be decided by qualified majority voting and for national security services to be subject to democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">The justification for all this is that this is what the people of Europe want from the European Union. I do not know which people Mr Brok has been speaking to, but they certainly were not British.

Regiunea Mării Negre dispune, fără îndoială, de un potenţial bogat de dezvoltare; în egală măsură, ţările din zonă se confruntă şi cu provocări serioase în mai multe domenii. Stabilitatea, dezvoltarea şi prosperitatea în zona de vecinătate a Uniunii Europene, consolidarea relaţiilor Uniunii Europene cu ţările acestei regiuni, precum şi încurajarea cooperării intra-regionale este, în acest context, de o importanţă majoră.

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the 21st century, European countries face a whole series of new challenges. These include globalisation, international terrorism, arms control and disarmament, stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction, uncontrolled migration, energy dependency and the safety of energy supplies, climate change, the prevention of the spread of poverty in the world and many others. All are problems and issues that affect all European countries regardless of their size or geographical location. They are all challenges, problems and issues that no European country, even the largest, is able to solve or resolve on its own.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We therefore need a joint foreign and security policy, and we have to strengthen it, at least to the extent proposed in the Constitutional Treaty. Above all, we need to create the post of European minister for foreign affairs, who would be a Commissioner and would chair the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In this way the Union would finally be able to speak with one voice. Among many proposals contained in the EU’s draft Constitutional Treaty are the need to create genuine European external action, the need to strengthen structural cooperation, and the need for a provision on aid, all of which are much needed.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Similarly significant is the fact that the process on the constitution should be completed by 2008. I feel that this is important, not only in respect of further enlargement, in this case involving Croatia, but also, as previous speakers have said, from the standpoint of making the common foreign, security and defence policy as effective as possible. I feel that without this Europe will become politically – and in time also economically – stunted in its development.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr Brok preaches the importance of the EU having a foreign minister and its own ambassadors around the world. He observes that only 18 countries have so far ratified the Constitutional Treaty and that ‘full ratification … needs to be pursued’. Consider that wording carefully: ‘full ratification … needs to be pursued’. This means, then, that the will of the people in two of the EU’s founding Member States is not being accepted. That is the way things happen here in Strasbourg and Brussels. As always, the same old mantra to the effect that Europe must be able to speak with one voice is heard again. That means that 27 voices have to be silenced. What, then, will the remaining voice say? Allow me to give an example. The invasion of Iraq was supported by a coalition of the willing involving the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Denmark and other countries. An EU with one voice would probably have approved the invasion, and German soldiers would have been forced to go to war, against the express will of the German Parliament. Think about it, and think again. Speaking with one voice necessarily implies one people with a single identity, but we Europeans have different identities.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, and the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Samaras, for their comments on the weaknesses and shortcomings of the CFSP and for their proposals for more action, better funding and better use of our capabilities, so that we can play an international role and address the problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is time, however, for us to ask once again: is all this enough? Will we get the anticipated results every time? It is a question being put to us by the citizens of the European Union and citizens in other areas of the world, mainly in areas where we are present but not effective enough.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to refer to the Middle East, as referred to in the Brok report, which has been experiencing a particularly abnormal situation over recent days. This situation is indeed a huge challenge for us. We offer coordinated and permanent humanitarian and development aid. We maintain peacekeeping forces, such as in Lebanon, and police forces, such as in Rafa, and we are waiting for the problems to resolve themselves or to be resolved by others or to go down roads dictated by others.</p>
      <p sl="el">We recognise that the heart of the problem is the Palestinian problem and yet we rely on temporary solutions and do not take fate into our own hands in order to arrive at radical solutions which will also be viable.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is time for us to see that there is a need for a more independent and autonomous European strategy, which will see things more clearly and call them by their name. That is the only way for us to be effective.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I recognise your efforts and I see they are alive and effective wherever I am in this area and elsewhere, but I believe that, before the Constitutional Treaty, which will give us a more cohesive and responsible framework, we can make sure there is better cooperation with the Council. Parliament can contribute to this more political and deeper approach to the issues and lay down a strategy.</p>

      <p sl="et">The situation whereby the European Union’s influence in international relations is clearly inferior to that of some Member States is intolerable. The careless classification of matters that are important to Member States as bilateral issues is dealing a deathblow to the credibility of the European Union’s foreign policy.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for this important report. It comes at a very crucial moment, when the German Presidency is trying to revive the Constitutional Treaty, perhaps without its title. The important thing is greater efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can we achieve greater efficiency in the future? Not only via the institutions but also through the political will of the Member States. Only if there is unanimity in our actual way of voting will there be the possibility of an effective common foreign and security policy. Therefore, we should go forward with more qualified majority voting on common foreign policy. This is very complicated, but I think it would make a real difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also like to thank our rapporteur, particularly with regard to his remarks on the delegations. I have started to work very closely with our people on more training, on better political reporting, on public diplomacy and on exchange programmes between the Member States, the Council, the Council Secretariat and ourselves in order to achieve – via osmosis, as I always say – a better understanding of each other and to prepare a cohesive approach in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just make a couple of further remarks, one about Kosovo. Kosovo is indeed a European problem, which needs a European solution with the agreement of the international community. The European Union is to take responsibility for post-status Kosovo. How can we achieve this? I think this can be done by setting up an international civilian office, by establishing a very significant rule of law mission and by continuing capacity-building on a large scale on the basis of, hopefully, a Security Council resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also like to say that today we have already had quite a long debate on the Middle East. We know how difficult the situation is, but I think the European Union has played quite an important role and wants to continue to play an important role, particularly in conjunction with other members of the Quartet. Even if the situation seems to be rather bleak today, we hope that we can still bring the two sides together for a positive approach in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to mention that the Black Sea is one of those new areas where we have focused our efforts with regard to our Neighbourhood Policy, because we think this is a new area with new Member States, like Romania and Bulgaria, we have reached out and we would like to work together with Turkey and with Russia on this region, trying to address many of the important issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with regard to contacts between the Council and the European Parliament, there is now an interinstitutional agreement, there is more contact between the Council and Parliament on CFSP issues, and I think the special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Matthiessen, who is here today, will certainly also mention that.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report by Mr Brok is an important step forward in European common foreign and security policy. With the successive development of European Industrial Union, Social Union – as part of the European social model – Economic and Monetary Union and the adoption of the single currency, Europe is now ready and must move to develop and project a united stance on foreign policy issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is beginning to happen. Europe has adopted a distinct stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Iran and the Korean Peninsula, all in my opinion with their commitment to dialogue and critical engagement far more appropriate than the confrontational and one-sided unbalanced approach of the Bush Administration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, the report expresses the need for a common approach to foreign policy issues in times of globalisation. The report mentions climate change, dependency on energy, failing states and international terrorism, just to mention a few examples.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0148/2007) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (COM(2006)0486 C6-0319/2006 2006/0165(CNS)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-396" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Kovács" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as you know, the Commission’s proposal under discussion follows the report presented by the Commission in May 2004 and the subsequent call by the Council of 12 April 2005 for the Commission to come forward with a proposal to revalorise the minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages to compensate for inflation. Its sole purpose is to maintain the real value of the minimum rate; it is not a proposal aimed at harmonisation or convergence of rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to begin by informing honourable Members of the discussions which took place in the Ecofin Council in November 2006. In the Council, there was strong resistance from a number of new Member States who claimed that they had had nothing to do with the point of departure for counting inflation of 1993, as they were not then part of the Community. I have some sympathy with this point of view and have therefore promoted a compromise, officially put forward by the Finnish Presidency, in the discussions with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">This compromise takes 1 May 2004, the date of accession of the 10 new Member States, as the point of departure, and results in a much lower rate of inflation. Instead of 31 %, the new proposed rate increase is only 4.5 %. Unfortunately, this compromise proposal was vetoed by one Member State, the Czech Republic – which, I might add, would be entirely unaffected by a 4.5 % revalorisation as the excise duty currently applied is higher. However, I am optimistic that, when the issue next returns to Council, the Czech position will have changed and that unanimity will be obtained.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, the impact of a 4.5 % revalorisation is minimal but, even so, transition periods will be available for the Member States affected. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, whose accession took place on 1 January 2007, such transition periods will be very generous.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to turn now to Mrs Lulling’s report, which certainly contains some fairly radical ideas. First, to repeat what I said at the very beginning, the Commission proposal is not aimed at harmonisation or convergence of rates, but is simply a revalorisation, which, under the compromise I mentioned, will take 2004 as the point of departure. Second, repealing the directive and abolishing minimum rates, as Mrs Lulling suggests, would have extreme consequences. For example, there would be no obligation at all for Member States to apply excise duties on alcohol, which in turn would create more distortion of the internal market. The abolition of minimum rates could also result in less freedom for travellers because Member States would press for tighter restrictions on the amount of alcohol that individuals could take from one Member State to another in order to stem the inevitable revenue leakage. I am definitely against re-establishing borders within the EU for alcoholic beverages and I am therefore also against abolishing minimum rates. It would also set a dangerous precedent for the other excises, such as tobacco and energy, which are also subject to minimum rates, and for other taxes such as VAT. Member States are required to respect certain rules in relation to tax rates. It could also raise health-related concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also like to say something about the proposed Code of Conduct, which effectively introduces a positive rate of excise duty on wine. As you know, wine is currently subject to a minimum rate of zero, and this remains the case under the Commission proposal. However, under the proposed Code of Conduct, the 15 Member States that do not currently tax wine would not only need to introduce a positive rate, but would ultimately need to aim their trade towards the EU average, which is currently EUR 48 per hectolitre. I am convinced that the proposed increase in excise duty on wine would not be widely supported by citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I sincerely hope that honourable Members will reject the proposal made in the report and deliver an opinion supporting the Commission proposals, as amended, of course, by the Council compromise regarding in particular the date from which to start counting inflation, 1 May 2004, which would result in an increase of just 4.5 % in the minimum excise duty.</p>

    <intervention id="2-397" speaker_id="1186" name="Astrid Lulling" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in politics, we sometimes need to show courage. Parliament could do that tomorrow by voting for my report, which proposes the abolition of minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. These rates were set in 1992 with a view to approximating the rates applied in the different States. This approximation has not happened, far from it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The minimum rates are not to blame, however, even though they have not been brought into line with inflation for fifteen years. If they were increased by 31% – as the Commission proposed in September 2006 – there would still be no significant approximation. In fact, the difference between these minimum rates, even if they were adapted, and the rates on wine, beer and spirits in the Member States of the North of the Union, would still be huge. By way of evidence, the tax on a litre of beer in the Czech Republic or Malta is EUR 0.0936, whilst in Finland it stands at EUR 1.43!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite many months of discussion, the Council has not been able to reach an agreement on adapting these minimum rates, however minimal an adaptation it may be. It has only just decided to ask the Commission to carry out a detailed study on the taxing of alcohol and alcoholic beverages, in particular the trends relating to competitive positions and price levels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Things being as they are, Commissioner, we must now escape from the impasse in which the Council and the Commission are tied up. There is only one sensible, logical and intelligent way to do this: to forget about minimum rates that no longer have any raison d'être and to reach an agreement on a code of practice that will help the Member States to bring their rates of excise duty closer together while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, which you have forgotten to mention. That is what the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing to you in my report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the amendments tabled for plenary by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I firmly propose that they be rejected. The Socialist amendments would lead to a botched job on the increase in rates and on the timetable. What is more serious, however, is the fact that they provide henceforth for automatic adaptations to the European price index in the event that it increases by 0.5%, with no consultation of Parliament or of the Council. When we think back to our battle in the field of comitology, such a proposal is a thing of folklore! To propose a zero rate, as the Socialists have done, for Bulgarian home distillers who consume their own products, was nothing but window dressing and an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Bulgarian citizens before the European elections in Bulgaria on 20 May. This is blindingly obvious, since the authors of the amendment in question know perfectly well that such an exemption would be impracticable and would have no chance of being adopted unanimously in the Council. The same is true of the withdrawal of my report from the agenda of the mini-session of 9 May, in order to prevent the Bulgarian Socialists from showing their true colours before 20 May: it has not helped much, in view of the Socialists’ result in Bulgaria, which was not so marvellous, I am pleased to say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the amendments of the Greens, I must first of all point out that they are unaware that it is fortunately not the Commission, but the Council, that has to decide on taxation. Such ignorance of the Treaty is all the more serious for a group that never stops preaching to everybody in this House! If, at the last minute, the Greens had not withdrawn their Amendments 24 and 26 – which call upon the Commission to set a maximum rate – we would have had to declare them inadmissible because they were incompatible with the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To classify wine as a substitute for beer, as the Greens do in their Amendment 25, is complete fantasy and demonstrates an under-developed knowledge of gastronomy. The wine producers of France, Germany and Luxembourg will not forget, by 2009, that their Green MEPs proposed abolishing the zero tax on wine, which is an extremely important agricultural product. These countries, which have chosen to apply the zero tax, are certainly not prepared to vote for its abolition as from 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you have defended your position, which has already died a death in the Council. I regret that you have not taken the opportunity that we are offering you on a platter to break the deadlock without losing face. It is a real shame! I am sure you understand Latin, Commissioner: errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum [to err is human, to persist is of the Devil].</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first and foremost, although I normally support wholeheartedly Commission initiatives on taxation, especially the common consolidated corporate tax base for companies, on this issue I also support Mrs Lulling and this excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Any report that deals with alcohol and taxation risks running into a lot of national sensitivities, and this has happened to this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 1992 – the last time this matter was debated in Parliament – the European Union looked very different. There were only 12 Member States, with GDP per capita levels relatively close to one another. It was then presumed that imposing minimum rates of duty on alcohol would result in price convergence across the Member States. We now know that, even if this had happened with the 12 old Member States – which it did not – the changes in the structure of our Union alone would impose the need for change. These rates are no longer up to date or beneficial for the European economy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am glad that Mrs Lulling came to the radical conclusion of scrapping all the minimum rates on alcohol duties and proposes a code of conduct instead. This is beneficial in many ways: it eliminates the need for continuous inflation checks and gives Member States the right to choose the level of duties appropriate for their economic and cultural conditions, which now vary greatly across the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand the concern as to what the next consequence in the Council might be. It is true that the Member States might try to impose some new barriers, but we are not in favour of that. We would like to leave Member States free to make their own stupid decisions, if that is what they want to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I would like to stress that being in favour of Mrs Lulling’s report does not contradict some Member States continuing to impose higher taxes on alcohol. This is the case, for example, in the Nordic countries, like Finland, where higher taxes are still used to finance, among other things, a wide number of health initiatives and campaigns. I support that policy in the Nordic countries, because we are not ready for very low rates of alcohol taxes in Europe. Maybe we are a less gastronomic country in that way, but this does not contradict my view that the Lulling report should be adopted tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I suspected that this debate on rates of excise duty would be passionate, and I believe that we have had a foretaste of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our rapporteur, who did not receive the backing of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament during the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, has urged us to show courage and, to her, showing courage clearly means erasing the past today. I recognise her Luxemburgish talent in this regard, concerning rates of excise duty in the field of alcohol, but forgive me if I do not follow her along this path and do not agree to this plea in favour of fiscal competition or free movement of goods within an internal market that would not actually be one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe your proposal to be a good one, Commissioner. I believe that the compromise elements that are currently on the table in the Council, which take account of the reality of the rise in rates of excise duty following the enlargement of the European Union, are good ones and that we should support them. The amendments tabled by my group are along those lines and are in no way a botched job, and Mrs Lulling has clearly not understood what they are essentially about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question is how to move forward in this field. The idea that it would be best to abandon everything on the grounds that it is a difficult task does not seem to me to be a good strategy. Furthermore, with regard to abandoning excise duties entirely, I am delighted to hear that Mrs Kaupi recognises that they can be useful, including in terms of public health, and that it is best to maintain them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Going beyond the particular problem of our Bulgarian friends, I believe that, as legislators, we must be serious and consistent and advocate maintaining the weak and inadequate tools currently in the hands of the Commission so that the operation of the internal market involves certain fiscal aspects. Commissioner, as you know, you can count on the full support of my group in this battle.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mrs Lulling, you have many good sides, but sometimes you also go wide of the mark, and that is what you are doing with this report. I shall recommend my group to reject your proposal as a whole and thus to follow the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In a report on price levels of alcohol, account must also be taken of the significance that increased drinking would have for public health. However, public health is a subject about which nothing is said. To abolish excise duty on alcohol, including beer, would be to give out entirely the wrong signals. We know that the harm caused by alcohol is on the increase, and we know that ever more young people in Europe are literally drinking themselves to death, and not only in the Nordic countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Every day, beer, wine and spirits – including half a million cans of beer and 65 000 bottles of spirits - flood into Sweden. This is due to the big differences in alcohol taxation. Higher common excise duties within the EU can play an important role in this area. The cost margin means a lot in this context, because the consumers we are talking about are price-conscious.</p>
      <p sl="sv">European integration must not take place on the basis of alcohol tourism. I am not asking for the EU to introduce Swedish-style taxes – that would be an alien idea to me – but what I do request is consideration for, and solidarity with, other countries and their inhabitants. That is why excise duties on alcohol need increasingly to be harmonised.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We Europeans drink more alcohol than anyone else in the world. Last year, the Commission presented a strategy for reducing the harm caused through alcohol. If we in this House want to adopt the Commission’s approach, we have only one thing to do, and that is to reject this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal to approximate the rates of excise duty for alcohol and alcoholic beverages has triggered lively debate and much controversy. This has been partly due to the variety of excise duty rates applied in individual Member States of the Union and partly to fears that those behind the changes are aiming for the Union to gradually take over responsibility for taxes from the Member States. It is alleged that their ultimate aim is a single tax on natural and legal persons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Inclusion of the proposed amendments to Council Directive 92/84/EEC would therefore weaken competition and lead to a reduction in the quality of individual products as well as to increased monopoly of the market by large concerns.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Anyone who, in the name of subsidiarity, wishes to abolish the minimum tax on alcohol must agree, also in the name of subsidiarity, to allow a limit to be placed on private imports of alcohol. Otherwise, countries with high excise duties will be completely overflowing with cheap, privately imported spirits and have to pay for this in terms of high health care costs. Without import restrictions, it will be the country with the lowest taxes that will force its alcohol policy on all the others.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What is the logic according to which it is possible to take 200 kg of wine, beer and spirits across the EU countries’ borders, but only 15 kg of fresh fish? Moreover, it is absurd to have zero tax on wine when there is tax on beer and spirits. It is even more absurd when Sweden is taken to court for having, as the Commission sees it, favoured the beer sector through its high taxes on wine. The EU is itself distorting the market through its zero tax on wine. Alcohol is not a normal product. To do as the committee does and see this as an internal market issue without taking account of public health is irresponsible and economically unsound.</p>

The conclusion is that it is pointless to set minimum rates when Member States are free to set higher rates and the directive should be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the EU is never going to relinquish control over anything, however pointless it may be, and certain countries will see their rates rise when the minimum rate is increased in line with inflation.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we were told in 1990 that rate brackets were needed. In 1992, we were told that minimum rates were needed. Now we are being told that floating minimum rates are needed, and always for the same reason: the eugenics, the health neurosis of the Protestant Europe, which should lead us to impose internal customs duties, to erect fiscal barriers, of up to nearly two euros per litre of wine, in Denmark or in the United Kingdom for example. But if our British, Danish or Swedish friends wish to impose taxes, let them do so! The Mediterranean countries, Germany and Luxembourg impose zero excise duties on wine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everybody is free, if they so wish, to take drugs rather than to drink, but we do not try to solve the drug problem through taxation. And we do not create health safety, if I dare say so, by means of taxation. Let them drink, let them live! There are endless maximum limits: we do not need minimum limits!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, here we go again – yet another timid, surreptitious attempt by the Commission to introduce tax harmonisation by the back door.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this House, we love to talk about ‘harmful tax competition’, so let us get one thing straight right away: there is no such thing as harmful tax competition; all tax competition is good. Any attempt at harmonisation represents a cartel operated by governments against the interests of the people. Like all attempts to harmonise taxes, this proposal will have the effect of raising taxes yet further in our grossly overtaxed economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s proposal has a further defect: by seeking to apply a common percentage increase across the board, it further exacerbates the existing distortion between beverage types, which unfairly discriminates in favour of wine at the expense of traditional spirits, like cognac and Scotch. Here I must declare an interest: I once worked in the Scotch whisky business; for several years I was Mr Johnny Walker in Korea.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any reasonable person must surely agree that the gross discrimination in duty terms in favour of wine, and against beer and spirits, which these proposals enshrine, is wholly unacceptable. It cannot be allowed to proceed. Let me therefore commend the work of the rapporteur, the admirable Mrs Lulling. Rarely has a report in this House distilled so much common sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 1992 measure to harmonise alcohol duties has failed in its objectives. The changes proposed by the Commission would also fail. The amount of duty collected is small, sometimes too low to justify the collection costs. Member States should be free to set rates that suit their own people and their culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Lulling’s final recommendation is that the Community legislation in this matter should be abolished. Let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on a job well done.</p>

      <p sl="en">Уважаеми г-н председател, уважаеми дами и господа, в аргументите, използвани от социалистите и от уважаемия комисар Kovács, има един голям проблем и той е следният: Те казват: „Когато акцизите се определят от Брюксел централизирано, няма проблеми със здравето. Обаче, когато се даде правото на всяка страна сама да определя своето акцизно облагане, тогава има големи здравни проблеми.“</p>
      <p sl="en">Това е несъстоятелен аргумент, който е типичен за хората, които имат централизиран начин на мислене. Страните имат повече информация, по-добре познават своите проблеми и могат по-добре да се справят с определянето на акцизните ставки. Защо мислите, че когато Брюксел определя централизирани акцизи, нещата изглеждат по-добре? Тази логика не я разбирам.</p>
      <p sl="en">Другото много важно нещо: здравните проблеми зависят от образованието, от информационни кампании и много по-малко от данъци. Разликата в доходите между Източна и Западна Европа е много голяма. Как при 10 пъти разлика в доходите да определите минимални акцизи, така че всички да са доволни? Това очевидно не може да стане. В страни като България и Румъния сегашното акцизно облагане представлява около 70 % от крайната цена заедно с ДДС, което създава огромен стимул за „сива икономика“, което означава производство, което не се отчита въобще от държавата. Тази „сива икономика“ ще навлиза и в други страни-членки на Европейския съюз.</p>
      <p sl="en">Затова въобще не може да се говори и не трябва да се говори за увеличаване на акцизните ставки. Напротив, трябва да се даде право на всяка страна в зависимост от своите традиции, национални особености да определя акцизните ставки. Това е разумното, рационално предложение.</p>
      <p sl="en">Напълно заставаме цялата българска делегация в Народната партия зад предложението на г-жа Lulling, което е изключително разумно. Това е едно законодателство, което 15 години не дава ефект. Очевидно е, че е излишно и ако имаме доблестта и смелостта, трябва да кажем: „Да, не върши работа.“ И трябва да бъде спряно. Неслучайно започна инициатива на Европейската комисия за премахване на тези директиви, които са излишни. Ето пример за излишна директива. Имате ли смелостта да я прекратите? Това е единственото решение.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, forgive me if I – contrary to what appears to be the norm here – do not gush with emotion about this subject. First of all, I should like to apologise for the absence of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Gottardi, from whom I will be taking over for now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have to say that I noted with great amusement how Mrs Lulling, like a latter-day Marianne, has led this battle, this insurgence against this proposal for a directive and this proposal to increase the minimum rates on beer and alcohol according to inflation. This is, indeed, as is evident, a subject which can boost one's popularity no end. Taxes are, of course, an unpopular topic, while beer and alcohol are very popular. Anyway, we, in our group, did not get carried away to that extent, because we, like Mrs Berès, feel responsible for the internal market and for fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The only negative comment I should like to make is that this directive, as it was drafted in the early 90s, is, of course, very poor legislation because it contains absolute figures. This is not a very good way of going about things, certainly if the topic requires unanimity of votes, because then it is virtually impossible to change those absolute figures at a later date.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is why I am so impressed with the proposal, which Commissioner Kovács presented together with the Finnish Presidency, that automatic indexation be provided for. I think it was a very positive gesture not to start as high as in the original proposal, but to make a more modest start with a view to increasing at a later date.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is why the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has tabled these proposals, which are currently being discussed in the Council, as amendments. I think it would be very wise and would bear witness to sound policy if a majority in Parliament were to vote in favour of them tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to support Astrid Lulling's report, because I believe that it is well balanced and relates to a liberal taxation policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The argument here today is not about the excise itself, the raising of which in steps of 1% will not, as the Commission likes to say, change anything, and the difference in customs duties between, for example, Lithuania and the Scandinavian countries will stay just as great. The argument is about whether we want to standardise and harmonise tax tariffs, or whether we consider that the diversity of our countries should be reflected in different tax tariffs and different taxation systems. Yes, we have to encourage business to function among the various countries, and a common domestic market has to be created. However, we can achieve that, and we have plans (Parliament has already accepted such a report) for harmonising the taxation base. Customs tariffs have to reflect the real situation in each country, and they have to create possibilities for business to show its initiatives. In those countries, where such initiatives are not supported by appropriate infrastructure, such as in the new Member States, such initiatives can be supported by separate tax tariffs. Competition is always a healthy thing, whatever point of view one represents. Our internal EU squabbles about which country is the cheapest appear quite amusing. Because the really cheap alcohol is in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Extensive alcohol consumption has serious social consequences, or what are known as negative external effects. In order more easily to understand the problem, a parallel may be drawn with the taxes imposed on vehicle fuel. Such fuel is taxed because it has harmful effects on the environment. By levying a tax, it is possible to combat the environmental damage caused by combustion. The cost is thus internalised, and the polluter pays.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The same principle can be applied to the sale of alcohol. Countries’ health systems are put under strain as a result of alcohol-related diseases. In this case, tax on alcohol has two effects. Firstly, less of a product is consumed if it is taxed and, secondly, tax revenue contributes to the exchequer. This money can then be used for caring for people with alcohol-related diseases.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Where minimum taxes are concerned, we believe that, when they exist, it is better to keep them than to remove them. Nor should an exception be made, as happens at present, for certain alcoholic drinks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Din lipsă de timp, o să mă limitez la a expune doar câteva consideraţii privind efectele pe care le-ar produce în România modificarea directivei pe care o analizăm, consideraţii transmise de către o asociaţie de producători de bere pe care le împărtăşesc şi le susţin. Se apreciază că aplicarea unei asemenea măsuri este, în prezent, dăunătoare industriei berii din România, deoarece va declanşa o competiţie neloială între unităţile producătoare de bere şi cele producătoare de alte băuturi fermentate, determinată de faptul că prin egalizarea propusă se va provoca creşterea accizei la bere, în timp ce la alte băuturi fermentate va rămâne neschimbată. Consecinţa directă şi imediată a acestei modificări este scumpirea produsului, în condiţiile în care în România coeficientul putere de cumpărare pe produs intern brut/locuitor indică faptul că berea este deja cu 200% mai scumpă decât media preţurilor practicate la produsele similare din Europa 15. Creşterea preţului va determina în mod automat şi limitarea producţiei, ca una dintre consecinţele diminuării consumului, ceea ce va provoca şi scăderea numărului de salariaţi din acest sector, cu tot cortegiul de efecte sociale şi financiare ce ar rezulta din acest proces.</p>
      <p sl="en">În sfârşit, dar fără a epuiza toate consecinţele pe care le-ar genera adoptarea unei astfel de decizii, se semnalează şi faptul că mărirea accizei la bere ar putea avea şi efecte inverse celor scontate, determinând per total o diminuarea a veniturilor bugetare ca urmare a scăderii vânzărilor şi diminuării personalului din acest sector.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I congratulate Mrs Lulling for writing the report, and I hope that tomorrow Parliament will also give her maximum support. We need a shift in philosophy as regards excise duties, for determining the minimum rates in euro does nothing to improve the status of convergence – we can see this. In other words, it simply does not achieve the objective.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Essentially, in a system that is open from the top, measured in euro, there will certainly not be significant convergence. In addition, we may even cause serious harm in this way, since in many Member States, generally the poorer ones, imposing price controls of which even Marx would be proud would mean placing new mandatory inflationary burdens on those Member States in which public finances are in order, thereby further limiting freedom in tax policy. Yet many of them have just raised, or are raising excise duties by force, and what is more, these penalised countries would even surpass the maximum level of revenues – as the economic analyses indicate.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This could be used to give new ammunition for the argument against introducing the euro in these countries – for instance in the Baltic and the Balkan states – with specious reasoning on the grounds of inflation, in order to keep them out of the euro zone. But how could we think that in Bulgaria or Romania, with their salaries of 100-150 euro, this will not generate a black economy, crime and illegal brewing? This is public health! Or will they spend half their monthly salary on excise duties?</p>
      <p sl="hu">Not to mention that the ingenious idea has been raised to subject wine, as a replacement product for beer, to the minimum rate as well, thus burdening even further this ancient European culture. If we want true convergence, and in this we agree as regards strategy, then we need to introduce a code of conduct – this is what I recommended, and the Commission has accepted it – in which Member States who are above or below the average excise rate will agree to make changes in the excise duty only in order to converge towards the average, should economic conditions permit it.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There is no question of restoring the borders, nor of abolishing the excise tax, this may be the only solution with regard to the excise tax policy. It is enlarged, and Member States of extremely diverse stages of development [the speech is broken off here].</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages, establishing minimum levels for rates of excise, is a valid method for reducing distortions in competition and imbalances in the functioning of the single market and at the same time leaving room for the Member States to exercise their fiscal competences.</p>
      <p sl="es">The review of rates, which have been invariable since 1992, is necessary in order to prevent the system from becoming out of date and losing its raison d'être. It is always a complex operation, since, though the initial approximation effort has been devalued over time, it has also been extended with the incorporation since then, in three successive waves, of fifteen Member States with very different cultures and situations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Abandoning the Community acquis, as proposed by the rapporteur, is a step backwards that could have a destabilising effect with undesirable consequences. Maintaining it will not prevent the Member States from exploring and anticipating new advances by means of soft formulae such as codes of conduct.</p>
      <p sl="es">According to the calculations, the Commission’s proposal of recovering, from 1 January 2008, 31% of the inflation increase that happened between 1983 and 2005 will not affect the majority of States, which have higher minimum rates, although it may lead to a sharp increase in others and have a negative impact on producers, employment and price control.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all of these reasons I believe that, in the review, wine should remain exempt, that the rates proposed should be reduced, taking account of the particular sensitivity of beer and intermediate products, and that the new Member States should be allowed to adapt gradually, since they are starting from very different positions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that periodic reviews should be carried out in the future, although automatic indexing could disconnect this fiscal instrument from the European Union's economic policy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, good evening. Mrs Lulling, you have been attracting praise from some quarters this evening. Aside from the fact that I commend you on your report, I would also like to say to you that it has given me great pleasure. This is because it reflects at least four points that I should like to emphasise here.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Firstly, your report is based on the idea that cross-border trade, with the free movement of goods, is one of the fundamental principles of European integration. Consumers make their decisions on the basis of price, that is to say, on the relative tax burden on the goods. If some Member States overload their goods with high taxes, they must react via their domestic tax policy, rather than wait for salvation from the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Secondly, I feel that one of the key points in your report is that tax competition is good and healthy. The creation of what is known as the single market of tax-free borders is simply a modern form of protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thirdly, as has been mentioned several times, each Member State has the right to pursue its own independent tax policy. Taxation and managing the proceeds of tax lies at the heart of political competition. As you know, Mrs Lulling, in this Chamber I represent the Czech Republic and its interests, and because my country is a well-known producer and exporter of beer, I should like to make one final comment. There is not one single reason why Czech brewers and Czech consumers should be penalised by the harmonisation of consumer taxes.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I really do think that the Commission’s original proposal with an adjustment from 1993 was the best, but I appreciate that, in order to reach a compromise in the Council, an adjustment from 2004 is the only option. Why am I in favour of the Commission’s proposal? Well, it is because of the arguments presented earlier. I want to see taxes, that is to say minimum taxes, on environmentally harmful activities because I want to reduce such activities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I take the same view on alcohol. Alcohol costs us a huge amount in public health terms. One effective way of dealing with this would, then, be to impose minimum taxes in order to reduce consumption. A strange argument has been presented in this debate. It is said that the moderate increase in taxes contemplated would affect inflation. For that to be the case in any single country, alcohol consumption and thus alcohol problems would have to be so incredibly extensive that it really would be high time that taxes were increased.</p>

    <intervention id="2-415" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Kovács" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers who contributed to the debate. As I said in my opening remarks, repealing the directive and abolishing minimum rates would have extreme consequences, and I should like to say a little more about this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without minimum rates, there would be no obligation whatsoever on Member States to apply excise duties at all on alcohol, and, indeed, given the low importance that some Member States attach to alcohol excise duties in terms of low duty levels, this must be seen as a real possibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have no doubt that, in the absence of minimum rates, some Member States would press for tighter restrictions on the amount of alcohol that individuals can take from one Member State to another, in order to stem the inevitable revenue leakage, and this would result in less freedom for citizens. There is also some suggestion that minimum rates interfere with Member States’ sovereignty. In fact it is quite the opposite. They support Member States’ sovereignty by allowing Member States to pursue their own fiscal policies, without the threat of those policies being undermined by other Member States and, in particular, by cross-border shopping and smuggling.</p>
      <p sl="en">That does not mean that minimum rates are designed to protect higher-taxing Member States. The fact that the minimum rates are set at a fairly low level and remain low even after the 4.5% revalorisation leaves Member States with plenty of room for manoeuvre. Those who wish to set their national rates at levels close to the minimum are not precluded from doing so. Equally, those who wish to set their rates far above the minimum are free to do so, but they must take the responsibility for the consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to confirm once again that the purpose of the proposal is certainly not harmonisation – not even approximation. The purpose of the proposal is revalorisation. As regards the possibility that the increase of minimum excise duty rates generated inflation, it certainly did not do that: it is a compensation for the inflation that has already taken place.</p>
      <p sl="en">To the argument that it can increase the black economy, I say that the lack or abolition of excise duty can generate smuggling and cross-border shopping which has nothing to do with fair competition at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as far as the Czech breweries and consumers are concerned, they will not suffer because, in the Czech Republic, the current excise duty rate is much higher than the new common minimum rate will be after the increase.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0169/2007) on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, of the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general principles for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European transport and energy networks (17032/2/2006 C6-0101/2007 2004/0154(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Mauro)</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-424" speaker_id="4393" name="Mario Mauro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European context it is difficult to imagine strong economic growth that creates jobs and wealth without an efficient, modern transport network.</p>
      <p sl="it">The trans-European transport network plays a crucial role in allowing the free movement of persons and goods within the territory of the European Union and is one of the decisive factors in achieving the European Union’s economic development objectives in relation to employment that were identified in the Lisbon Agenda. This is all the more applicable in a Europe that, with enlargement, has gone further in two directions: towards central and eastern Europe and southwards.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, with the TENs the European Union is including among its goals the elimination of bottlenecks in the rail network and the upgrading of priority routes, with a view to absorbing new traffic flows generated by enlargement, particularly in border areas, and improving access for the outlying regions. In this way, the TENs can act as a reference point for Community legislation that is designed to promote economic and social development and territorial cohesion for the countries of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we all know, funding of the TENs has suffered a significant reduction in comparison with initial forecasts: the 2007-2013 programming set aside EUR 8 billion in funds for the TENs, which is a sharp cut compared with the EUR 20 billion initially requested by the Commission, although it is double the funds made available in the 2000-2006 period.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have accepted this cutback and have pressed on with the resources that have been made available to us, and throughout the lengthy negotiations have pursued four basic objectives: 1) simplification, to speed up the procedural process; 2) conditionality, to prioritise modes of transport with a lower environmental impact; 3) selectivity and concentration, to promote the concentration of resources on projects with high Community added value; and 4) proportionality, with a view to differentiating the maximum amount of Community resources that may be granted in line with the type of project to be financed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have mentioned just some of the objectives reached by us with the aim of accurately identifying the financial commitments: the increase of the cofinancing rates to 20% for priority projects and to 30% for the cross-border sector. Thus we have a clear increase in Community financial aid for projects aiming to eliminate bottlenecks in the networks of the least-favoured regions, as, moreover, is already the Commission’s intention with regard to the process of revising the TENs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will also mention the use of up to 85% of budget resources for priority projects, a clearer definition of bottlenecks, in order to allow natural barriers to be overcome, and a new structure for the European Rail Management Traffic System, which can now benefit from 50% cofinancing rates. There are also innovative new parameters for the ‘loan guarantee instruments’ issued by the European Investment Bank and new measures that make it possible to supply risk capital participation, with the possibility of involvement by the private investment sector too.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I would like to clarify the issue of comitology, by setting out precisely the content of the compromise achieved: the procedure agreed on follows Article 5 and not Article 5a, which from one point of view would have been the best choice for Parliament, but from another would have caused a further postponement of work, preventing the appropriation of Community funds during 2007, with extremely serious consequences for the implementation of the programme. Even though Article 5 applies, there are plans for Parliament to be closely involved. All the proposals will be sent at the same time to both the regulatory committee and Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to be able to carry out its own assessments well in advance, before the proposals are adopted. This fully satisfies the need to keep both the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism constantly informed.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, Commissioner Barrot, in his letter of last November, guaranteed that he would personally make sure that the chairmen of the two parliamentary committees involved were kept informed of all changes. The letter was inserted in the final text of the regulation, guaranteeing the Commission’s commitment to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Personally, I am strongly convinced that the issue of comitology must be investigated further and analysed with a view to avoiding future stalemates. This compromise represents an individual isolated case dictated by the need to speed up the procedure with a view to avoiding a blockage in the appropriation of Community funds for the TENs.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the light of this clarification, Mr President, I would like to ask all Members present in the Chamber to vote against the amendments tabled. Since agreement has been reached on the text in its entirety, voting in favour of these amendments would mean reneging on this agreement, reopening negotiations with the Council once again and nullifying all the efforts made during the negotiations, which were started with the precise intention of rapidly unblocking the funds earmarked for the TENs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, a year ago, the Commission presented to Parliament and to the Council a draft regulation laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have had to modify the Commission’s initial proposal of 2004, which was drawn up on the basis of higher budgetary resources that were closer to the requirements. The reduction in the budget for the trans-European transport and energy networks within the framework of the financial perspective 2007-2013 has obliged us to review certain principles of the Community co-funding of the projects included within this network.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, Mr President, Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having been willing to increase this budget by EUR 500 million. Without that support from the European Parliament, the budgetary reduction would have been even greater.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The draft regulation has been modified in three respects. Firstly, more attention is focused on the funds for the highest priorities, those that provide the greatest added value; secondly, special emphasis is placed on new instruments for promoting, in particular, public/private partnerships; and thirdly, the levels of Community aid have been reduced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of these new conditions, we must seek greater efficiency in the selection of projects and be as innovative as possible in the field of financial engineering.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that Parliament and the Council have supported this approach and that there have been no fundamental disagreements. The European institutions are unanimous on the need for continued development of the trans-European transport network with a view to achieving the Union's economic, social and environmental objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new regulation therefore establishes a clear basis for focusing the available resources on the main priorities of the trans-European networks, that is to say, the priorities approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2004 within the framework of the decision on the guidelines for the trans-European transport network.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The cross-border sections of the priority routes will clearly be the main priorities in terms of Community funding. I am thinking of Brenner and of the Lyons-Turin railway. Furthermore, other priorities include the traffic management system for all modes of transport, including the European rail traffic management system, which provides for the interoperability of infrastructure, and inland waterway infrastructure, and including the two priority projects, and also maritime transport, with the motorways of the sea, the river information service and the vessel traffic management system. These priorities are in line with the Commission communication on promoting river traffic and maritime traffic and on the development of sustainable transport in general.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is therefore seeking an effective approach with the commitment of the Member States. The Member States must also focus their investments on the priorities set in the decision on the TEN guidelines and they must make use of the public/private partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If Parliament is indeed willing to adopt this financial regulation, on which Mr Mauro has produced an excellent report, the Commission, for its part, will issue invitations to propose projects on the day immediately following Parliament’s adoption of its position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That shows, Mr President, how much I hope you can confirm the agreement negotiated amongst the three institutions, on both the procedure and the substance. This agreement is the result of a compromise, which has already been reflected in the amendments to the Commission’s initial proposal and the Council’s common position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I have already fulfilled the commitments I had made to the committee by keeping you informed at the same time as the Member States at each stage of the procedure. The agreements that have been passed must be respected, of course. It is in this way that we will be able to adopt this regulation quickly, for the sake of the development of the major European transport projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, for all of his efforts. I share his desire to see the text adopted as it stands, with no amendments, and I would like to restate my commitment, Mr President, to submit any future draft decisions in this field to the chairmen of the transport and budget committees. I shall provide them with any additional information that they may require. That is my commitment, and I am reiterating it solemnly before the European Parliament this evening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I shall listen carefully to the Members who are going to speak on this subject.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Vice-President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for the role you have played as mediator, which has been very important in achieving this compromise, but I would also, of course, like to offer very sincere thanks particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, and to the former chairman, Mr Costa, who is still actively involved in things, not to mention Mr Lewandowski, for bringing this compromise about.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, it has to be said that the Council dragged things out for months on end, and it is the Council that is to blame for our present inability to pay out even now the money for trans-European projects in 2007; there is no doubt that responsibility for this lies with the Council, for it would have been much better for us to have had this Financial Regulation earlier on and been able to take a decision at an earlier juncture.</p>
      <p sl="de">You, Commissioner, have undertaken to keep us fully informed, and I am sure you will communicate not only with the chairmen of committees, but also the committees themselves. I would urge you to be as stringent in examining these things as you have undertaken to be. Let there be no national quotas; the funds should be approved for projects that are of importance to Europe, and not to this or that country.</p>
      <p sl="de">Rather than fund in dribs and drabs, we should support the really important projects; what that means is that not everyone should get something, but the projects that are of real importance to Europe should, following consultation with this House and with the Commission, be comprehensively subsidised.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the German Federal Government to clarify by this summer how things stand in respect of two major and cross-border projects in Germany, or else the EU will not be able to take them into account in its financial planning. Firstly, it must produce clear plans for the deepening of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which is intended finally to make navigation of the Danube from the Black Sea to the North Sea economically viable, and, secondly, Germany and Denmark must come to an agreement on the building and financing of a fixed link over the Fehmarnbelt, a project that can be included in the financial planning only as and when evidence of a bilateral agreement has been produced.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by saying, on behalf of our Socialist Group in the European Parliament, how very grateful we are to the rapporteur for the way in which he has guided us through this subject area, which is not exactly lacking in problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">As previous speakers have already said, the Council, in particular, when gathered together in ministerial meetings, is given to pious utterances affirming its commitment to advances in this area, while also shying away from doing anything when it comes to the hard facts, such as financing and, in particular, cross-border momentum, and this is where I have to agree with the previous speaker that we have to pass this ball to the EU’s ministers and Heads of Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you know, we faced the challenge of a Budget reduced almost to a third, something that, as the Commissioner had pointed out, had come about only because this House, in the Financial Perspective, had fought to get something more or less reasonable up and running with this reduced Budget. We took the decision to concentrate and to bring in criteria, in which respect it is vitally important that the Commission should demonstrate rather more backbone when it comes to monitoring than it did with the Financial Perspective, on which the stance it adopted was positively feeble.</p>
      <p sl="de">Knowing as we do that the Commission is not always steady in the saddle, we have secured our interests by creating a 100% reserve for the funds for 2007, so we can go ahead in the certainty that the commitments once again made in this House today will actually be carried out in reality.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Mauro for his constructive cooperation. Overall, I would like to say that we have had constructive cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this instance. It is high time that we obtained this legislation. Like Mr Jarzembowski, I too would like to point out that agreement was reached as long ago as November and things could not go fast enough at that point. Since then, however, the ministers have had an incredible amount of time – much too much, in fact – and we only got formal adoption in the Council in March. By now, the Commission should be in full swing in terms of producing work programmes and inviting project applications from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="da">It seems to me that the whole process that we have gone through with this legislation gives the impression that the Member States are a little half-hearted in their attitude towards these very important transport investments. This is also evident from the Council’s heavy-handed cuts in the budgetary framework, with resources for the trans-European networks being cut back from EUR 20 million to EUR 8 million. I am convinced that more resources will be needed and that, when the mid-term review comes around in 2009, we shall have to provide more money not only for the Galileo satellite system but also for the trans-European networks.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would also like to say how pleased I am that we managed to include new financial instruments in the regulation – as in the case of the Fehmarn Belt bridge, which is being funded by loans and is to be paid for by its users. Commissioner Barrot, you have held out in this House the prospect of underwriting the bridge’s finances for the first five years. It therefore seems to me a positive thing that the European Investment Bank is also involved in developing new financial instruments. There is a need for better cross-border corridors in Europe, and since the necessary resources are not to be found in government budgets it is important that we find new ways to fund such projects.</p>
      <p sl="da">The comitology procedure was a point of contention between Parliament and the Council. The majority in Parliament gave way, and I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his promise to involve Parliament in drawing up the work programme. I look forward to us achieving a result soon so that we can release this year’s budget – which has been placed in reserve – and so that work can get under way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the multi-annual budget makes provision for a total of some EUR 8 billion, yet the TEN projects are overshooting the 600-billion mark, so this is just a modest matter of priming the pump. Most of the Member States are so deeply in debt that they are not allowed to take up new loans, but are obliged instead to pay off their enormous debts, yet, all the same, many of them are dreaming of big trans-European projects.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I propose is that we first study how traffic might be reduced without putting us to great inconvenience, and how that traffic that is really necessary might be organised using existing infrastructure in a less socially and environmentally damaging way. The construction of most traffic corridors scarcely does anything to resolve transport problems, still less anything to address the problems associated with energy and climate change.</p>

    <intervention id="2-430" speaker_id="23781" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as we come to the end of the three-year process of creating a new legal framework for financing common energy and transport policies, we are aware that we are running out of time. We are also aware of the tremendous expectations and needs in this area, which will not be met by reducing funding from EUR 20 billion to EUR 8 billion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As an observer and a participant in this process I should like to thank all those involved in the compromise, namely the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, our partners from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Commissioner Barrot and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As regards the European Parliament, this compromise implies a degree of concession, already referred to by Mr Mauro. This relates to the area of comitology, as legal studies had suggested we adopt a stronger stance. Understanding the possibilities, however, in December 2006 Mr Mauro and I wrote a joint letter to the then Finnish Presidency, promising that if the Council adopted the agreement without amendments, we would endeavour to achieve the same in Parliament at second reading. This happened and the ball is now in our court. I propose honouring the agreement, in other words, not delaying the regulation Europe is awaiting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A new chapter in financing projects is opening. It involves an area in which Europe has not been particularly successful to date. Whilst I do not belittle the problems or conflicts of interest that are emerging, I believe that consolidation of transport systems is one of the key aspects of this continent’s integration. As Mr Jarzembowski stated earlier, however, this does of course mean projects of a cross-border nature.</p>

    <intervention id="2-431" speaker_id="4306" name="Gilles Savary" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating my fellow Members, Mario Mauro and Paolo Costa, on the excellent work that they have done. We were keen to ensure that the call for proposals could take place and not be prevented or hindered by the slow pace of our parliamentary work. I believe that we will be very close to the end if we go along with Mr Mauro’s voting advice tomorrow. For my part, I shall do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say that, by means of this regulation, we have worked hard on the substance. This regulation is much better than the previous one in many respects. In fact, it is almost a shame that we have such a good instrument for managing such a miserable amount of money. Why is it better? Because, by concentrating the funds, by increasing the levels and by creating more types of funding, we have managed to identify genuinely European priorities. We have the means to promote European projects and therefore not to be content with funds being scattered across different Member States for vote-catching projects. I believe that that is extremely important and I personally am pleased about it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say that, with regard to this regulation, which is going to enter into force very quickly, two difficulties remain. Firstly – I say this here, and we will see it in practice – I frankly find the EIB to have a blatant conflict of interests. In this House, we are constantly being asked to put up great walls of China in order to compartmentalise accounts in companies, and then, lo and behold, we see that the EIB is going to issue loans for companies for which it itself is going to provide guarantees, and even manage the interest subsidies! I think that that is excessive. We must keep an extremely close eye on all of this, in order to ensure that it does not help itself to the best bits and leave the worst bits for everybody else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, there was that issue of the information for MEPs. We have the word and the letter of the Commissioner and very soon we will have the necessary documents, I believe. I acknowledge that. I would have preferred an inclusion within the body of the text, of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there is a cloud hanging over this project and over the programming, and that cloud is Galileo. I believe that we must be clear on this subject. We have a very good regulation for intervention, but we still have to recover around EUR 2 to EUR 2.7 billion, and my wish is that, just as for the funding initially provided for, we tap as little as possible into the elements of the financial perspective connected with the trans-European transport networks.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, as of tomorrow we will finally make EUR 6.5 or 6.8 or 8 billion available to the TEN project. Unfortunately, this is a drop in the ocean compared with the estimated 240-330 billion needed for priority projects, or the 600 billion for the whole network. This drop in the ocean is liable to dry up if we do not succeed in ensuring that the Member States play their part. This cannot, of course, be left simply to the initiative of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore call on the Commission to take on another responsibility as of tomorrow, and one which is fully permitted by the Treaty, which provides that the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States, may take any initiative designed to promote coordination of policies in relation to the TEN. The Commission needs to take control of the policies for the overall funding of the whole project and to find a way to resolve the problems. One such problem is that fully EUR 122 billion of the estimated EUR 240 billion for the projects will have to be financed by countries that at the moment are not in compliance with or are having difficulties complying with the Maastricht parameters and to which, in theory, we have said we will not make loans.</p>
      <p sl="it">This problem must be raised at Community level and resolved. I hope that the Commission will take this issue into consideration and make progress with it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Regretăm reducerea pentru perioada 2007-2013 a bugetului alocat reţelelor europene de transport şi energie de la 20 la 8 miliarde, sumă care, deşi este dublă faţă de bugetul alocat în perioada 2000-2006, reprezintă doar 1,3% din necesarul de finanţare de 600 de miliarde de euro până în 2020. Tocmai de aceea, regulamentul încurajează utilizarea parteneriatului public - privat şi introduce noi instrumente de finanţare precum garantarea împrumuturilor, împrumuturi europene şi un fond de bonificare a dobânzilor aferente. Cele 30 de proiecte de transport prioritare stabilite în 2004 vor beneficia de finanţare europeană în proporţie de 20%, excepţie făcând tronsoanele transfrontaliere, care beneficiază de finanţări în proporţie de 30%. Prin aderarea României şi a Bulgariei, Uniunea Europeană a dobândit vecinătatea cu Marea Neagră, iar aproape întreg cursul Dunării se află în interiorul său. Extinderea reţelei transeuropene de transport şi energie pentru a include în piaţa internă de transport şi ţările vecine Uniunii Europene face parte din politica de vecinătate a Uniunii Europene şi contribuie la realizarea sinergiei la Marea Neagră.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for advocating the approval of the common position adopted by the Council last March, because this approval will represent the final stage, enabling us to lay down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to respond to what many speakers have said by stating here and now that I have no intention of giving in to the temptation to scatter, to the temptation to disperse appropriations, which would do nothing to promote the creation of these routes, the development of which is absolutely crucial. I can confirm, Mr Costa, that, over the next seven years, the Commission will do everything it can to ensure that this new Community legislation is implemented properly. The Commission is determined to ensure effective and visible results, which meet your expectations and those of Europe’s citizens and companies, both parties seeking, as they are, an efficient and sustainable transport system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can respond once again, particularly to Mr Savary, by saying that I have already fulfilled my commitments to provide Parliament with information, commitments that I am restating. I would also like to say to Mrs Ţicău that we will not forget the new Member States and that we will put in a great deal of effort in those countries. Like Mrs Jensen, I believe that it is also high time that we put pressure on the Member States to commit themselves along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also taken good note of the questions from Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Bösch. I would like to thank you for your constructive approach throughout the legislative process. Mr Mauro, I would like to thank you in particular, as well as the chairmen of the two competent committees – the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Budgets – and all of the Members who have worked on this dossier. I shall work in a spirit of close cooperation with the European Parliament in order to implement these major projects, which will require us to put the European general interest before all other concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I wished to say, Mr President, and I would like to thank Parliament in advance for being willing to allow us to move on now to actions and to be able to launch the call for proposals so that Member States can respond in such a way as to enable me to launch operations as early as the autumn.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report submitted to us today formalises our demands regarding the implementation of the financial aid for the trans-European transport and energy networks (TENs), in the difficult conditions that we are experiencing, where the budgetary resources for the TENs have increased from the sum of EUR 20 billion, which was initially announced, to EUR 8 billion for the period 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These networks are, however, crucial to the future of the European Union, helping as they do to guarantee, on the one hand, mobility throughout Europe and, on the other, the energy flows that safeguard our independence and our solidarity. These major projects should also help to diversify modes of transport and to promote alternatives to road travel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do of course regret this drastic reduction in the budget, which has meant us having to amend the eligibility criteria. I am pleased that we have nevertheless managed to adapt the funding mechanisms with the aim of guaranteeing the lever effect of the Community contribution by concentrating European funding on the border sections and by developing the incentive to have public-private partnerships, as well as through the funding and guarantees provided by the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament must now be able to exercise its control rights in full with the aim of preventing funds from being spread too thinly and of ensuring that the much–needed major infrastructure is actually built.</p>
