      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (Α6-0131/2008) by Mr Lehideux, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Training Foundation (recast) (COM(2007)0443 – C6-0243/2007 – 2007/0163(COD)).</p>

    <intervention id="4-005" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I want to salute Parliament’s work on the proposal to recast the regulation establishing the European Training Foundation and, in particular, thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehideux.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the European Training Foundation was created in 1990 to support implementation of the PHARE external assistance programme in the field of vocational training. Currently its scope covers the countries of the previous TACIS, CARDS and MEDA programmes. The European Union’s policies in the education &amp; training and external relations fields have developed and the ETF regulation therefore needs to be updated to take account of those developments. The result is the Commission proposal on which you have been working.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our proposal does not provide for any new ETF activities. Rather, its aim is to define its tasks more clearly on the basis of a broader thematic remit that includes the concept of human resources development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proposal also expands the Foundation’s geographical scope in line with the EU’s new external relations instruments. In that new context, the ETF’s tasks therefore need to be adjusted, while remaining guided by the clearly established priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am grateful to the European Parliament for addressing the Commission proposal in a positive manner. Thanks to good cooperation between the three institutions, we have managed to find solutions that satisfy all three of them, including on such sensitive issues as the composition of the Governing Board and the way in which the European Parliament can contribute its specific expertise. The Commission therefore accepts without hesitation the consolidated text resulting from last week’s constructive trilogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me conclude, on behalf of my colleague Jan Figel, by stressing how important it is for our cooperation to be successful, since that will allow the European Training Foundation to benefit from its new legal basis in due time and therefore provide more effective assistance to the beneficiary countries, which is, after all, obviously the purpose of this exercise.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-007" speaker_id="2326" name="Bernard Lehideux" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was in Turin I was able to appreciate the excellent work done by the Foundation, which is a vital and highly effective instrument to promote the development of vocational training systems in EU partner countries. The Commission proposal updates the ETF’s tasks and governance to ensure that its activities are founded on a solid legal basis. In my view, the compromise reached with the Council offers progress in two essential directions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, the new regulation will enable the Foundation to operate in all the EU’s partner countries, including those outside the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy and the pre-accession programmes. That is a crucial point. For example, the Union takes decisions that have a direct impact on its ACP partners’ economy. I need not remind Commissioner Michel that this happened recently in the case of the reform of the COM in sugar, which forced those countries radically to diversify their industrial activities. The ETF could have made a useful contribution to that development and can do so in future in similar cases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second benefit of the compromise, to which I attach special importance, is that it genuinely involves MEPs in reviewing the Foundation’s activities. That question, however, goes beyond the framework of this agency. Parliament has only one opportunity, often very brief, to look at the way the agencies operate, during the budget and budget discharge votes. In my view, it is no longer possible, especially with the forthcoming entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, for Parliament not to be more seriously involved in the matters with which the agencies deal. That is why, in the specific case of this Foundation, Parliament will henceforth nominate three representatives, without the right to vote, true, but three representatives on the Governing Board, provided they are particularly skilled in the Foundation’s areas of activity. Parliament is free to appoint either external figures or MEPs. It will be up to it to take a responsible decision as to the choice of level of representation on the Governing Board. The main point at this stage is that henceforth the choice is available and that the debate on Parliament’s involvement is launched.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given the growing number of agencies, it is imperative for all the European institutions to take a close look at the means of monitoring their activities. In that context, I am convinced that we must create a real link between Parliament and the agencies. Similarly, the new regulation aims to formalise the hearings of the Director of the Foundation before the parliamentary committees. For several years now, that Director has appeared before Parliament once a year at the invitation of the Committee on Employment, but that invitation was not formalised in the past. Lastly, the Governing Board will appoint the Director for a period of five years, on the basis of a list of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission; before being appointed the candidate selected by the Governing Board will have to make a statement before the European Parliament’s competent committees and answer questions put by members of those committees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be honest. On the subject of Parliament’s involvement the compromise we have reached is rather less than what I would have hoped. But we have to look things in the face. As the debate stands now, people are not yet ready to go any further. So it is reasonable to support the negotiated package so that the Foundation can function as soon as possible on solid bases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore ask Members to adopt Compromise Amendment No 11, which is the result of the trilogue Commissioner Michel mentioned a moment ago, to adopt it in its entirety and not give in to the temptation of an amendment that would upset the balance we have achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thank the Slovenian Presidency and the Commission for the quality of our dialogue on these matters and, of course, I thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their support.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="4293" name="Gabriele Stauner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks for the constructive negotiations with the Council and the Commission, with the greatest debt of gratitude, of course, being owed to our rapporteur, Mr Lehideux.</p>
      <p sl="de">In committee and in the trialogue we reached a compromise for the Foundation in Turin, which is to be put on an entirely new footing by virtue of the new regulation. Our main objective in refocusing the Turin-based agency is to strengthen relations between the Foundation and the European Parliament and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the Foundation. This Parliament attaches high priority to the promotion of vocational training in Europe, and we believe that we should no longer merely assess the work of the Foundation on an ex post basis, as a kind of auditing body, but that we should have a specific upstream part to play in the process of determining the content and shape of its programmes and that we should be able to contribute our opinions.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, we attach great importance to two points. The first of these is the composition of the Governing Board, and the second is the procedure for appointing the Director of the Foundation. On the latter point we arrived at a sound solution in committee on the basis of a PPE-DE proposal. As the rapporteur said, under Article 10 of the new regulation, the Director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission. Before being appointed, the candidates are to appear before the competent committee or committees of the European Parliament to make a statement and answer questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">A more difficult issue, and one which has not been resolved to the satisfaction of my group in the present compromise, concerns the composition of the Governing Board. The arrangement set out in the proposed Article 7, whereby Parliament can appoint three non-voting representatives, is inexpedient. We want the chance to be efficient players in the Board's decision-making processes and not mere embellishments. We therefore consider it essential that Parliament should be able to send three specialised representatives to serve on the Board, and it goes without saying that they must have the same voting rights as all the other Board members.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to ensure that the Governing Board operates efficiently, we believe it is essential to limit the number of its members. We do not see any compelling need for every Member State of the EU to send a representative. Instead, we should make do with representatives from two thirds of the Member States, applying the rotation rules prescribed by the Treaty of Lisbon. With three representatives each from the Commission, Parliament and the partner countries, the Member States would still be preponderant. After all, a governing board is not a meeting of shareholders but is supposed to represent the body of shareholders in day-to-day decision-making and to take rapid decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I therefore appeal once again to the Council – whose representative, unfortunately, is not in attendance – to reconsider its position. For the sake of operational efficiency, I ask the House to support our Amendment 10.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehideux, for his cooperation and work on the report on the European Training Foundation in Torino. I have been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we have been through some tough negotiations with the Council, but I believe that we have arrived at a good compromise proposal. Although the work of this foundation is aimed at countries that are not members of the EU and have therefore not adopted the Lisbon objectives, it is nonetheless meaningful to talk about the objectives in this context. After all, the Lisbon objectives are in reality just a way of achieving progress and growth, and one does not need to be a member of the EU to wish for that.</p>
      <p sl="da">Education is one of the factors underpinning growth and development within the EU. Investing in better education can help to ensure that we in the EU achieve the Lisbon objectives and together make Europe a better place in which to live. Another important tool for achieving the Lisbon objectives is flexicurity in the labour market, and education and flexicurity are very closely linked. Through education a better and more competitive workforce is created, which in turn enables stronger growth to be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is important that we consider the future of the EU from a long-term aspect. Therefore, the European Training Foundation is an extremely important agency. The EU must not be a closed club. It is important that we help potential new Member States as much as we can. We must of course require new Member States to meet certain requirements and standards, but we must also help them to do this. I believe that the new structure that we have introduced for the Foundation in Torino is a major advantage for future challenges and I believe that the Foundation can help potential new Member States to join the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am also very pleased that the Foundation’s new structure reinforces the link between the European Parliament and the Foundation. We are gaining the opportunity to appoint three experts to the board. This shows that the Council has begun to accept that the European Parliament must also have more influence in this area.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="39713" name="Renate Weber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Lehideux for his report. I fully share his opinion concerning the extended geographical mandate of the European Training Foundation (ETF).</p>
      <p sl="de">That agency, which works as an instrument of EU external policy, has the potential to respond fully to challenges addressed by territories like Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The rich experience that the ETF has acquired over the years could now be channelled towards areas that desperately need vocational training in order to improve access to learning and social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="de">Most of the countries in the ACP area are currently facing remarkable economic reforms, and in order to be successful need human resources. The ETF should have the mandate and the resources to respond to such demands. I would go even further and say that when enlarging the mandate of the ETF, we should plan to have temporary liaison offices in areas where the activities of the agencies are concentrated. Such offices would allow the ETF to better organise its activities and would give more visibility to its actions in third countries. I fully agree with the proposal of the rapporteur that more transparency is needed, and I fully share his suggestion to add MEPs to the governing board of the agency.</p>
      <p sl="de">To conclude, I consider that when it comes to human resources, the European Union should take a broader approach. We want to set up the ‘blue card’ procedure that allows skilled workers from abroad to work legally in Europe, with the EU probably contributing to the training of those skilled workers. However, as I have already said, skilled workers are also badly needed in their own countries if there is to be a genuine development of those regions. The role of the European Training Foundation will therefore be essential.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="28418" name="Sepp Kusstatscher" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by commending the European Training Foundation in Turin for the valuable work it has been performing since 1994.</p>
      <p sl="de">The work of the agencies and foundations is often regarded as nothing more than a cost factor. I firmly believe that what our Foundation in Turin is doing constitutes very useful neighbourhood aid, whether it be in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe or in North Africa. The practical assistance that the ETF gives our partner countries in the development and creation of high-quality training systems can scarcely be prized highly enough. May I therefore express my thanks and appreciation to its senior management.</p>
      <p sl="de">I must address some frank words of criticism to the Council, whose negotiating tactics, following the achievement of consensus in the first round, involved topping up the Council representation to 27 and then initially failing to understand why we in Parliament also wished to be represented on the Board and then, finally, agreeing to three specialised representatives, but as non-voting members. The Council's attitude was simply incomprehensible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only repeat that the uptight, defensive attitude of the Council Presidency is beyond me. It is further proof of the difficulties encountered by the governments of our Member States when it comes to gauging the importance they should attach to the European Parliament, the only democratically elected institution of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">My thanks go the rapporteur.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="28493" name="Derek Roland Clark" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the IND/DEM Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, once again the Commission is getting ahead of legislation. The EU has no competence over education, at least not until the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, and that depends on the Irish referendum. Is the result of that a foregone conclusion, or will a ‘no’ vote there be just swept aside like the French and Dutch referendums?</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, what kind of structure will this training foundation have? I see that our proposal is for it to be run variously by six representatives from Member States, plus six from the Commission and only three from Parliament, or that plus representatives from partner countries appointed by the Commission. In the latter case, responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not Member States, giving the unelected Commission a major say. Hardly democratic.</p>
      <p sl="de">Amendment 7 suggests that the Commission would submit candidates for the directorship of the ETF, and this causes concern in many quarters. It has resulted in further suggestions as to the make-up of the ETF board, right up to an unworkable one representative for each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="de">To have so many counter-suggestions for the composition of the board of the ETF is not exactly the best of starts, but that begs the question: Why does anyone think we need such a foundation? I would argue that a training foundation is not only unnecessary, it will be counterproductive. If you care to look round the countries of Europe as opposed to the EU, you will find training programmes of all sorts scattered around. There are different standards but, between them, they develop many skills, which is why Europe has such a rich heritage. You see, each country has always produced its artists, composers, authors and so on. Even the small countries come up with, for example, composers of world renown. Each country produces its leaders and experts, its technicians, bankers, sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training.</p>
      <p sl="de">So there is a multiplicity of skills, with each country contributing in its own way. If we try to put all that together in a European Training Foundation it would drain the life out of the training schemes in many countries. A single ETF will not have the intrinsic qualities of national flavour. We need variety, not a harmonised one-track theme.</p>
      <p sl="de">In short, we will lose more than we gain with such a scheme. Please forget it and let the countries of Europe make their contributions to the whole. That might even generate enthusiasm for the EU project, for that is sadly lacking, judging by the ‘no’ votes of two founding states and the continuous efforts being made to sell the EU to its peoples.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019" speaker_id="2107" name="Jan Andersson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sv">Thank you, Madam President. Let me begin by thanking Bernard Lehideux for his excellent work, for excellent contacts with the President and coordinators during the process and for enabling us to achieve a settlement on first reading. I also want to thank the representatives of the European Training Foundation for their input, an important contribution providing many further links. Education, vocational training and lifelong learning are increasingly important. They are important in the EU, but also in the partnership countries. There is a need for cooperation between Cedefop and the European Training Foundation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This proposal for a new Regulation contains some elements which make for improvements. To begin with, the remit is broadened to include lifelong learning instead of focusing solely on vocational training. This is a concept which we increasingly draw upon and which is important in our policy. Secondly, the number of countries is increasing, as Mr Lehideux said. They include all the partnership countries, not just those included in the neighbourhood and pre-accession programmes, but all partnership countries. Thirdly, relations with Parliament are strengthened. We have enjoyed good cooperation which can now be developed through the new Regulation. I think that we have arrived at a good settlement, both as regards the way we appoint the Director of the Foundation but also as regards the fact that we can appoint three experts without voting rights on the Governing Board. We did not get all we wanted, but it is still a good compromise which bodes well for the future. It is a good basic position. We can develop lifelong learning as a cooperative process between Parliament and the foundations working on these matters. That is important.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first I want to say thank you and to welcome the various statements made here, all of which are in support of Mr Lehideux’s report. Obviously I also support it because I believe it really is a big step forward. I can already see and envisage new prospects that – whatever some may say – are opening here and I am therefore delighted that we will no doubt achieve a broad consensus on this proposal. Let me reply to two objections that were put forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, Amendment 10 to Article 7: I would just remind Mrs Stauner that there is a risk of conflict of interest, since Parliament is the authority that gives the budget discharge. Legally, at least, there would clearly be a conflict of interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I think it is sensible to separate the powers. I was a parliamentarian for many years and I never claimed any responsibilities beyond those due to parliamentarians. The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is not to govern, I am sorry to say. The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is to scrutinise and to make laws, and of course to monitor governments or executives. I do not, therefore, understand that shift in emphasis that some people seem to find normal. I am speaking for myself, but we are holding a parliamentary debate and I believe for Parliament to confuse its monitoring task with a governing task, which is incompatible with its role, would detract from its fundamental task. That is how a parliament can be destroyed. For a parliament to want to become a kind of governing assembly would not be compatible with the high principle of democracy. I am saying that because I do believe the separation of powers is important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that the compromise reached is the most effective one, primarily because it ensures Parliament’s independence in carrying out its monitoring function.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I admit I am often taken aback by some of the views expressed, but then that is what we are here for. I believe it was Mr Clark who said the Commission was exceeding its competences and that the European Training Foundation could be counterproductive. That is quite contrary to reality, experience and totally independent evaluations of the remarkable work done by the Foundation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Commissioner responsible for development, I can already foresee – thanks to the main amendment, which will no doubt be adopted – the prospects of effectiveness, the positive prospects that will be offered, especially, as some speakers suggested, in countries within my remit where vocational training is a crucial factor. I am thinking, for example, of the centre for migration management and information in Mali, a pilot project we will soon be starting up. I can imagine what a useful role the Foundation could play there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So I can only welcome the outcome, and I totally reject the criticism that it is counterproductive. Clearly, people cannot change their nature: those who do not like Europe say exaggerated things and that – let me say with all due respect to the Member concerned – is exaggerated; it is therefore totally meaningless.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-023" speaker_id="2326" name="Bernard Lehideux" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I believe all or nearly all of us take the same view on the substance of the matter and I thank the Commissioner for what he has just said about the future prospects of the Foundation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One point obviously remains to be settled and I want to make an observation about it: it is the EPP’s Amendment 10. Dialogue between the European institutions is absolutely vital. That dialogue took place. My colleague Mr Kusstatscher says that the Council's attitude during that dialogue was not exactly what we might have expected. He is right, but in the end we had the trilogue, we had several meetings, and at the end of those meetings we signalled our agreement. I do not believe dialogue between our institutions is possible if, after giving our agreement, we take it back a few days later by tabling an amendment. So, we debated, we were not entirely in agreement about everything, everyone took a step towards rapprochement with others and we ended up by achieving a compromise text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am asking the groups, all the groups, to accept the idea that we show solidarity in the decision we have taken, in the agreement we gave to the Council and the Commission at the end of the trilogue and I ask them to reflect that solidarity in their votes. When one asks for change one must also know how far one can go. I said a while ago that I would have preferred to go a bit further, but that I did not believe everybody was ready for that yet in their minds. As rapporteur for this document, having obtained a great deal and been supported in my work by my colleagues, I would ask them to continue to show solidarity regarding our compromise agreement until it is time to vote.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (Α6-0171/2008) by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness (2008/2048(ΙΝΙ)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-026" speaker_id="4241" name="Johan Van Hecke" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Three years ago, over a hundred donors and partner countries entered into a commitment in Paris to make aid to developing countries more effective, amongst other things to aim for more harmonisation, democratic control, mutual accountability and greater transparency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unlike the earlier Monterrey Declarations, the Paris Declaration established clear objectives, translated into twelve actions and indicators, in fact a major step forward. In December this year in Accra, an initial assessment is to be made of what has become of all those fine promises.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It must be said that in recent years the European Commission has made great efforts to implement the new aid agenda. It can be proud of what it has achieved in terms of division of labour, better coordination and respect for the local contribution. In 2006, at the instigation of Commissioner Michel, it even went a little further than the undertakings in Paris and approved an ambitious plan of action and the concept of division of labour and results-based management. However, there is still work to be done. Many intentions still have to be put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For instance, aid is still not sufficiently geared to national systems and too many different payment systems are still involved. As regards the uncoupling of aid, we are hardly getting anywhere. Technical cooperation is still too donor-controlled. The Donor Atlas urgently needs to be updated and extended, and then mainly focused on the most neglected countries and sectors.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Apart from that, approval of the code of conduct for the division of labour is problematic. Firstly because the Member States do not fulfil their promises. The Member States are lagging behind, both in scope and efficiency. For the first time since 2000, the percentage spent on official aid has fallen, from 0.41% in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. There needs to be a radical change of course in order to achieve the Millennium Goals. If the Council wants to retain its credibility, it has to confirm its promises as a matter of urgency. The Member States must commit themselves to a time path for the quantity and also the quality of the help. Quantity and quality are actually inextricably linked.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The great challenge of qualitative reform is and remains reinforcing own contributions and mutual accountability. However, that requires a regular dialogue with the social midfield, local governments and above all with parliaments. Greater transparency is absolutely vital. More budgetary support requires efficient parliamentary scrutiny of all funds promised and paid. That is why this report argues in favour of adding a thirteenth indicator to the Paris Agenda. If the role of European and African parliaments in ensuring greater efficiency is so important, why not translate that into an extra indicator?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the biggest donor the Union must assume its responsibilities in Accra. It must, first and foremost, set its own house in order. Only then can it credibly take the lead in Accra and put forward an ambitious plan. The Union has not only the expertise but also the ability to become the most efficient donor. What is needed now is for promises to be turned into action on the ground. That is the essence of this report, for which I venture to ask for your support.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-028" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Van Hecke, and the Committee on Development for this excellent report. I am also delighted to find that we have exactly the same approach and are fighting to achieve the same results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe the next six months will be vitally important in terms of testing the European Union’s real resolve to make concrete progress on the three main pillars of development policy: firstly, achieving the Millennium Goals; secondly, increasing aid volumes; thirdly, improving aid effectiveness. The Accra meeting in September will test the credibility of the entire process and all the players involved. Either the process will really take off, or it will be bogged down forever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today’s debate is, therefore, very important in that it can pass on a strong message to the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week. That Council will discuss the Commission’s proposals in relation to the objectives. I hope that in its turn that Council will send out a message that is just as ambitious as the one contained in Mr Van Hecke’s report. By acting together, we Europeans made a difference in Paris in 2005. We must be equally ambitious today and ensure that in Accra we move on from rhetoric to action on all our commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have heard too many voices in our Member States that want to turn Accra and this debate into a technical debate about feasibility, effectiveness, and so forth. It is not a technical debate. Accra is not a technical meeting. It is a political meeting, at which we will find out whether the Member States have the political will to meet their commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The battle is far from won. The Commission cannot act alone. That is why I am calling on you to mobilise all your resources and contacts to ensure that this summit proves a real success. The burden of proof now lies in the camp of the Member States and of non-European backers. An alliance between Parliament and the Commission is, therefore, vital.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not repeat what is written in the report. I agree almost 100% with it. We need concrete progress in important areas, of which I will cite just a few. The first is aid predictability. I am most grateful for Parliament’s support for MDG contracting. That is one of the proposals I will be putting on the table in Accra. Of course the partner countries will have to play their part in this contract and, obviously, we will have to set up monitoring mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, there is the question of making greater use of partner countries’ procedures. That is why I have said that in countries where that is possible budgetary aid should be the main instrument for channelling aid. It is interesting to note – and I believe it is important for you to remember the figures I am going to quote – that to date Tanzania has had to produce some 2 400 reports for the various donors and, listen carefully, more than 8 000 audit reports for the multilateral development banks. You must admit that is flabbergasting and poses a real problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report rightly emphasises the need for increased transparency and responsibility in development aid, although obviously that is impossible with such a jungle of reports. It can be done only if we strengthen parliamentary oversight in relation to development financing and its inclusion in the national budget, as the rapporteur said. We must encourage ‘democratic ownership’ and we will support partner countries in their endeavours to strengthen that ownership and oversight. Obviously, parliaments and civil society play a key role here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third point concerns the division of labour. The code of conduct must become reality. Another example: in Mali, 26 donors are involved in rural development, while in Burkina, five donors are involved in half of all the country’s sectors and half of all donors are involved in one third of all the sectors. So that is where the margins for improvement lie in the various countries, in terms of effectiveness, and I would really like to have Parliament’s support in trying to convince the Member States of the need for a better division of labour. That would bring a quite colossal improvement in aid effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My fourth point concerns situations of fragility. An example is that in 2006, 65% of the aid granted to Ivory Coast, Liberia and the Central African Republic came from only three bilateral donors. There again we have already proposed pilot countries involving the largest number of Member States. In procedural terms, I have called for the Commission to be as flexible as it can under current rules so as to improve our ability to react. Having said that, we must not forget that the aid effectiveness issue is not the exclusive preserve of the donors; on the contrary, it must also be the cornerstone of the partner countries’ action and be central to our dialogue with them. Only the partner countries are in a position to force us to provide more effective aid by actively defining not only their development objectives but also the means of achieving them. That is the only way our dialogue can progress on a basis of partnership founded on equal rights and obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to make a last point before concluding. Parliament is asking the Commission to give the delegations adequate room for action. You are quite right! We are trying to do so by means of our decentralisation process. We ask a lot of our delegations. As you know, resources are limited and, in the end, the capacity to use our delegations also depends on the budgetary authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I would ask you to help us convince our Member States – something Mr Van Hecke also brought up – that they have a moral duty, an imperative obligation, to respect the commitments they made in 2005 regarding the amount of aid they allocate. You know that 2007 is a year to be forgotten as quickly as possible because certain countries did not honour their commitments, which eclipsed the good behaviour of others who, for their part, showed they were able to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we will propose, firstly, that they reiterate their 2005 commitment and, secondly, present an agenda, a road map, a phased plan showing how they will achieve the objectives to which they subscribed. As I said at the beginning, we have not won the day yet, because according to my information preliminary meetings indicate that some Member States might even be prepared to refuse to reiterate their 2005 undertakings, which is of course unacceptable, while others would clearly not be prepared to plan in phases either. I therefore need your strength of conviction and, if I may call it that, your capacity for cheek, to make everyone face up to their responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The report on aid effectiveness is important for three reasons. Firstly, it deals with the European Commission’s responsibility to manage properly the funds of the EU’s citizens. Secondly, it draws our attention to the need for better structuring of development programmes. Finally, it calls for the political courage to monitor the budget and fight against its misuse.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I congratulate my fellow Member Mr Van Hecke on the report, which underlines the Union’s dual responsibility: both external and internal. If we want to be a credible player in our external relations, we have to provide the developing countries with as much finance as we have promised, and to distribute it as we said we would. We all know how difficult it is to judge whether or not financial aid has been used in an effective manner. Often the political and cultural circumstances in developing countries force the donors to adopt a creative and flexible budgetary approach. In spite of that, creativity and flexibility must not interfere with the need for transparency and honesty.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We will be honest if we admit that European public funds often do not bear the expected fruit, and if we stop their potential misuse. In order to be able to prove that development aid has been effective, we should obtain the recipient’s signature confirming that the project has really been operational in the long run. I must say that the most important responsibility of the European Commission and of the European Parliament is the internal responsibility to be honest to the citizens of Europe. The European Union finances development assistance from our taxes, and we know very little about its effectiveness. I congratulate my fellow Member Mr Bösch who recently criticised the way in which the European Union distributes development aid provided by the taxpayers’ money. Aid effectiveness is not only a necessary budgetary exercise; it is also a test of the political courage to point out that the taxpayers’ money must be used in an effective manner.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks our debates about aid effectiveness have been marked by the dramatic news of the world food crisis. That crisis is a brutal reminder that if we cannot ensure the most elementary right, the right to life and to enough food, our efforts in the area of development aid will be in vain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In his report, Mr Van Hecke, whose work I applaud, points out that a long-term strategy is the only way to give real support to the development of our partner countries. In regard to food as to public health and education, we need lasting solutions if we are to respond to the deep-rooted causes of the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The many amendments tabled by the PSE give support to the rapporteur’s position and strengthen it in some respects. We pointed out that our priority objective must be to achieve the Millennium Goals, the first of which is to eradicate poverty and hunger. To that end, and to render the aid more effective, it must be more locally owned, as close to home as possible and to the needs of the local population. That is why I pointed to the need for greater consultation with national parliaments, civil society and local authorities in regard to formulating, implementing and evaluating development policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Similarly, it is essential that we effectively combat corruption and make the aid more transparent. In concrete terms, we are asking the Commission to produce a matrix of all the funds allocated to local governance in order to check the coherence of the policies and the sound management of those funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, because a debate on improving aid effectiveness cannot be dissociated from the question of the amount of the aid, let me again – as was done a moment ago – point to and condemn the unjustifiable reduction in public development aid between 2006 and 2007, when it fell from 0.41% to 0.38% in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Accra summit will indeed be political, as the Commissioner said. It will offer the donor countries a unique opportunity to reiterate their commitment. It is up to us to be at that meeting and not to disappoint our partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Johan Van Hecke, for an excellent report. I endorse fully paragraph 1 of the report. However, the Member States and the Commission can only make their actions more harmonised, transparent, predictable and collectively effective if they pool resources under a single institution responsible for development aid. That is my first point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Aid effectiveness is in our own hands, as quite often we spend far too much on the administration in charge of responsible use of development aid in target countries. We should save, for example, on staff training, administration and expenses so that more development aid actually reaches the recipients.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the moment there is no proper coordination between the Member States concerning the allocation of their funds. According to the principle of subsidiarity the executive power ought to reside at the lowest feasible level unless designation of power to a higher level presents considerable advantages.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Michel, and also Mr Van Hecke for a good report. It is excellent that agreement has been reached regarding the content, and that EU aid will be both increased and improved. Aid must be aid. We must not dilute it by using it for other purposes, such as debt cancellation, where money is simply moved from one post to another in the donor countries. This money must be used for those who need it, and we must be able to see that it is being used for that purpose. It is, of course, the only way to get Europeans to increase the growth in aid – they must be able to see that it is effective, as Jeffrey Sachs said so clearly recently. It is therefore important that Amendment 1 is adopted.</p>
      <p sl="da">Aid must also continue to increase up to 2015, as we have promised on an incredible number of occasions. It is petty-minded and embarrassing that the EU aid decreased between 2006 and 2007. Without more money, aid cannot possibly be effective enough. We will not achieve the goals unless we live up to our many promises.</p>
      <p sl="da">It would also be nice if the European Parliament could grasp the EU’s agricultural policy. There are many analyses from the World Bank, the IMF, the UN and others that document the fact that the common agricultural policy is undermining the opportunities open to developing countries to grow, and here I am not talking about export subsidies, which are grotesque enough but only account for a small fraction of the destruction being caused by this policy. As the situation now stands, we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other – sometimes taking away a little more than we have given. We cannot then wait for the United States to withdraw its agricultural support. US agricultural support is worse than ours, and the EU should lead by example.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I too would like to thank Mr Van Hecke and the Commissioner for this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sub-Saharan Africa receives more international aid than any other region in the world yet poverty levels remain stubbornly high. Studies have shown that aid can and has been successful in reducing poverty in countries with sound economic management and government institutions. If allocated properly, aid has the potential to help millions of people escape a hand-to-mouth existence.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the reality is that corruption does exist in many developing countries and, while we must continue to promote good governance in these countries, we have a more pressing responsibility to help the many millions of people dying of starvation and disease in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must deliver on the commitments we have made to the Millennium Development Goals. How can we turn a blind eye to the three billion people living on the equivalent of three dollars a day or the five million children in Africa who died last year before they reached the age of five?</p>
      <p sl="en">And yes, we do have a responsibility to the European taxpayers to ensure that their money reaches the most needy and is spent effectively. In this regard I believe that Europe should look at more targeted programmes, such as the Global Fund, which combats AIDS, TB and malaria, the world’s most devastating diseases, which kill over six million people per year. The Global Fund has been a highly effective organisation with minimum bureaucracy and maximum impact. It represents an innovative approach to international health financing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Global poverty is predominantly a rural problem. Three quarters of the extremely poor people in developing countries live in rural areas. If we are to weather the storm of climate change and increasing food prices, we must improve agricultural production by targeting agriculture-specific programmes as they can have a powerful impact on poverty reduction. The presentation that Professor Jeffrey Sachs made to the committee recently was a great example of how that money can be targeted.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the World Development Report last year, GDP growth generated by agriculture is four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. Instead of shipping food aid to Third World countries, Europe needs to lead the way to help African farmers grow more food by providing small farmers with proper seeds, fertilisers and water management technologies. But of course there are many other ways and, as the Commissioner said, many of these need to be country-specific.</p>
      <p sl="en">Time is running out for Africa. We need to learn the lessons from the past so we can save future generations from disease and starvation. I believe Accra is a political opportunity and I support what other speakers have said on that. It is not just a technical meeting to look at technical areas, it is a political opportunity. We have to see if we can get real take-off on fighting poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made many many commitments; some of those commitments are not forthcoming. We are halfway through the Millennium Development Goals time-frame and it is time that we really pushed to try and deliver on all of these. We have to get aid back on track. We must work with African governments; we must fight corruption; we must improve governance and we have to deliver to the world’s poor.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that there is still much to be done in order to make European development policies more effective. The recommendations contained in Mr Van Hecke’s excellent report, which I fully endorse, certainly go in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we are debating this report, Brussels is witnessing the presentation of the new annual report of CONCORD, the European confederation of development NGOs, on the aid commitments given by EU governments. The report examines the progress made by each Member State, and the picture which emerges is one of gaps and contradictions in our policies to combat poverty and increase aid effectiveness. For example, as Commissioner Michel was telling me, the report notes that in 2007 the amount of aid given by the 27 did not increase as it should have done, but actually fell. At the same time the report shows that many of the problems associated with development policies still persist, such as the lack of transparency of linked aid.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should respect commitments given at international level. We cannot dash the expectations of people in the southern countries of the world, nor those of people in the so-called northern countries who are working with such commitment to ensure that injustice, poverty and the food crisis, to which Mr Schapira just referred, are handled decisively.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the Commissioner: we need to stop the rhetoric and take action. I would also like to thank Mr Michel for his passion, his commitment and his fortitude. With the two conferences in Accra and Doha, 2008 can and should be a real turning point and offers an outstanding opportunity for the European Union to show that it can shoulder its responsibilities as leading world donor. It seems almost superfluous to say that we need to increase the quantity and quality of aid. These are not two conflicting concepts. We must not use the need to make aid more effective as an excuse for giving less of it.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, everyone is now aware that simply increasing the quantity of aid is not enough. It is vital, as we have all been saying, to have an objective for the fight against poverty, instead of geopolitical and strategic objectives. As we are always saying, commercial, migration and security policies must be consistent with development goals.</p>
      <p sl="it">European cooperation needs to be based not only on our own interests, but also on the genuine priorities of southern countries as identified by local governments, and also by parliaments and civil society, and it is also essential to increase the transparency and accountability of EU aid programmes. In this context, Parliament should be put in a position to exercise genuine democratic control and I welcome the Commissioner’s call to work hard to ensure that EU countries stand by their commitments.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have a few questions regarding calls for proposals. Those NGOs which want to participate in the Commission tendering procedures find that they are too long and cumbersome, which makes their activities really difficult and in fact excludes many small local associations. So why not ask these organisations directly how to streamline procedures? I have submitted an amendment to be voted today with this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is the matter of the untying of aid which is dealt with in the Van Hecke report. Progress has been made, but all aid needs to be untied completely in order to prevent money returning to donor countries instead of relieving poverty in beneficiary countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I would like to pinpoint those States which are still overstating their public development aid figures. In 2007, EU countries spent around EUR 8 billion, in other words about 17% of total European aid, in important sectors but not in the development sector. Cancellation of debt, expenditure on refugees, grants for foreign students constitute expenditure which should be excluded from development aid figures; and so I invite you to support the relevant amendments.</p>
      <p sl="it">I too have high hopes for 2008 and for the commitments to reverse the trend; I agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner when he talks of shared responsibility between donors and countries where everyone has to play a part: rights and obligations. That is our strength!</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-042" speaker_id="4559" name="Maria Martens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Development money can and should be better spent. That, Madam President, is what we can conclude from the extremely balanced report by the rapporteur. I congratulate him. The report has come at the right time. Europe seems to be getting tired of development expenditure. That trend is very worrying and we should not underestimate it. Even in countries such as the Netherlands, which have always been known for their international solidarity, voices are heard in favour of cutting development expenditure. The only answer is for the work to be transparent, efficient and results-based.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Union can achieve a great deal on that point, especially through the three Cs: coherence, complementarity and coordination. The Commissioner has often pointed that out and is working towards it. We can also do more about the proliferation of projects and programmes. If something is not going well, another programme is not always the best solution. It is better for us to do a couple of things well than to half-do everything.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the European Union is the biggest donor. So we have a big responsibility. Besides that, with the new Treaty our possibilities for more cohesion, additional policy and better coordination are growing. The effectiveness of our aid is crucial, not just to justify the developing countries at home, but above all actually to be able to combat poverty in the developing countries. In the end it is the result that counts more than the intention. In the 2009 development cooperation budget, I shall be putting forward proposals for evaluation to be more results-based as well. We must focus more on results than on vague indicators.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Michel the following question. Commissioner Fischer Boel said that the Commission wanted to use some of the unspent money from the 2008 European Budget to help countries affected by the sharp rise in food prices, in other words for the food crisis. I should like to know the reaction of the Commissioner. Can the Commissioner also say how these extra funds will be used?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-044" speaker_id="28282" name="Alain Hutchinson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in history, in our history – as the Commissioner said – the total amount of public European development aid has fallen. If we continue along that road, between 2005 and 2010 the European Union will have granted billions of aid less than it had pledged. That is a significant step backwards in the pursuit of the goal of devoting 0.7% to development but also – and that is very important – in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals and, more generally, in the battle we say we want to wage against poverty in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The process we initiated in 2006 to improve the effectiveness of our development aid, and which we are continuing with the report by Mr Van Hecke, whom I thank for the work he has done, cannot be used by Member States as a pretext for not respecting their commitment to increase that aid. In fact the reverse is true, since everybody agrees today that additional resources will be needed on top of the pledged amounts if we are to meet the many commitments we have entered into and those we will, no doubt, still have to take on. Aid effectiveness is, therefore, essential, because more effective aid also means more aid. Everyone must realise that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, let me point out that, as ever, it is time we made very concrete progress in applying innovatory financing instruments to development aid, something that was mentioned expressly in the Paris Declaration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We wanted our report also to refer to the role of the diaspora in development cooperation. The European Union is still far too nervous about this, although it would benefit so much from greater and closer cooperation with our fellow citizens from partner countries who are resident in the EU. That would be another means of integrating rather than excluding a great many people and it is a message close to my heart at a time when some Europeans are adopting positions that are astonishing, measures that are shocking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I want to point out that, as the Commissioner has often said, aid will never be really effective until there is real coherence between the various EU policies and until aid is no longer guided by policies that have nothing to do with development. Current events show that we do not yet have that coherence everywhere. This situation will continue so long as the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, which is the relevant authority, continues to apply an extremely broad definition of development cooperation. That is another condition for improving our aid effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two years ago I presented a first report on aid effectiveness in this very Chamber. Where are we now, after all those endlessly repeated words? At any rate, the Commissioner can count on the socialists to carry on with our common struggle to improve aid effectiveness for the sake of the poorest people of the world.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank Johan Van Hecke for a good and important report. Once upon a time I went into politics to see to it that my country, Sweden, would achieve the ‘one per cent target’. The Liberal Party of Sweden – my party in the national context – is and has always been a driving force in this action, and Sweden actually achieves the target.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now nearly 40 years on, however, I have to recognise that there have been many disappointments. Maladministration, corruption and failed projects have unfortunately been common. But development has often also proceeded in the right direction. Millions of people the world over have been given better lives and many democracies have been established. There is indeed room for optimism. But if legitimacy and support among the EU population are to continue to be strong, we must improve our ability to act fast and effectively. Aid must be deployed in a way which guarantees quality and long-range benefit so that we can attain the millennium goals.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Besides, aid policy must be formulated more from the bottom up. Those countries which receive aid must be entrusted with greater responsibility for what we might call the problem-stating prerogative in aid work. There are plenty of indications, according to the Commission, to show that poor countries are forced to create more expensive bureaucracy in order to facilitate the administration which is a condition for the aid money to be disbursed. That was not the intention! It is also very important to talk more about how we should coordinate aid efforts. Another perspective which can and must not be forgotten is the important role of women in combating poverty.</p>
      <p sl="sv">To criticise how the requirements are formulated today does not mean that we need not oppose the imposition of conditions for the aid. Listening to what people on the ground have to say also implies that we should venture to consider classifying certain military contributions as aid, since peacekeeping operations can be vital. Take the situation in Chad, for example, where refugees need protection just as much as shipments of aid.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally I want to address the sensitive question of our agricultural policy, which Mrs Auken mentioned. In the report, the Commission and the Member States are urged to support any measures which can contribute to stabilising raw material prices for the developing countries. Here I have a suggestion in line with what Margrete Auken was saying: an effective, but perhaps also bitter medicine – scrap the EU’s agricultural policy! Indeed the Commission has already made a start on that, which is to be welcomed.</p>

      <p sl="es">Although the Commission is working hard and taking measures to ensure aid arrives at its destination, we cannot make progress if Member States do not contribute what they have promised.</p>
      <p sl="es">We know that both donors and partner countries are responsible for aid being more effective, but our greatest responsibility is to ensure that aid really contributes to helping developing countries meet the major challenges they face.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must ensure that we fulfil our part of the bargain and that we do not have to feel ashamed because we are not doing what we promised to do.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ideally, aid has a positive effect on development and good governance, but aid can also do a lot of harm if it is not distributed properly. Developing countries must therefore take responsibility for implementing their own policies and we donors must respect that, give them our support and provide the space necessary for that to happen, rather than fund our own priorities as some donors do.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to stress the need to ensure the coherence of our own policies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur. The report is comprehensive, wide-ranging and exhaustive. I must admit that, reading the report, I lost sight of even the most important objective. However, the rapporteur clearly stated this objective and the main purpose of the report in his presentation at the start of our debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I decided to speak because some new issues have come up in the last few years. Climate change has had a dramatic impact on some developing countries. What is important is that, when we provide aid, we should emphasise the fact that we are doing this now because the European Union recognises that the threat posed by climate change is a challenge to our civilisation as well as being civilisation’s responsibility. We should, therefore, in the light of the risks of global warming, significantly increase funding, and strengthen the actions of donors. Such a standpoint and such activities will demonstrate the nature of our strategy as regards the EU priority of ‘combating climate change’. We should also direct our assistance to renewable sources of energy in developing countries (of course fighting hunger is the most important, but I am talking here about additional funds), as well as for overcoming the direct effects of global warming, for adaptation measures associated for example with coastal flooding, soil salinisation and a level of floods and droughts that was previously unknown.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us remember that our objective, and the political priority for the European Union, are to achieve a global agreement on combating global warming. Negotiations will take place in Poznan in 2008 and Copenhagen in 2009. If we need to convince other countries, we must reduce emissions and develop new technologies within the EU and provide special assistance to developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, if we are talking about effectiveness so much, there can be no doubt we are convinced we have a serious problem of effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">Probably the first condition for ensuring increased effectiveness is to plan a fixed and binding schedule for aid flows. It is very difficult to make something effective if there is not a minimum of certainty about what resources are going to be available.</p>
      <p sl="es">Quality also depends on quantity and, like my colleages, I deplore the fall in resouces allocated by European countries to development aid. I hope you do not mind me saying so but there is one notable exception, and that is my country, Spain, which now comes top after increasing development aid by 33% last year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, we have an opportunity in Accra and we must do all we can to make sure that 20% of aid is used for education, health, access to water and basic sanitation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also want to assure you of the Committee on Development’s support for your attempts to coordinate the different actors. There are only a few resources and, as you have often said yourself, they have to be divided between many actors, and this process of dilution reduces effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to point out, as does the report, the need to simplify the procedures for granting aid. We find the same problem wherever we go: there is no doubt that the time taken between when we say we are going to do something and the time when it gets done undermines any attempt to promote the effective management of resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate and thank my colleague, Johan Van Hecke, for his remarkable work. His report notes that the approach to development aid needs to be reformed. I can only agree, and stress that this reform should start with a re-think from the roots – namely development policy – upwards. I strongly believe that aid should no longer be limited to help, support or assistance. We should change our mindset and see our contribution to developing countries as investment in the broadest sense of the word. It should be an investment that we undertake on a long-term basis, not just for ensuring the survival of those countries, but also for their real development as functional economies and democracies.</p>
      <p sl="en">While investing, we also need to touch on core issues that could bring a real end to poverty. A couple of weeks ago, during his visit to Parliament, Professor Geoffrey Sachs underlined how much influence, in positive terms, the use of unexploited land in Africa would have on food prices. Instead of providing food supplies to Africa, we should transfer agricultural know-how so that the continent can feed its own population and, in a positive scenario, even provide food at global level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am deeply concerned by another issue underlined in this report: the programming of money flow towards recipient countries. From my experience, projects cannot achieve their goals if resources do not come in time and if they are less than the amount initially planned. That is where the European Union can fail badly. In 2007 the level of EU aid decreased. Many projects were affected and their goals could not be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, development education and raising the awareness of our own citizens on this subject should be considered a priority. We, as Members of this Parliament, have an essential role to play in that respect.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-056" speaker_id="28280" name="Filip Kaczmarek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, some of the experts, economists, politicians and activists in non-governmental organisations involved in development have a tendency to say that all that is needed for cooperation in the area of development to achieve its ambitious goals is to provide more money. However, life is not that simple. There are many social and economic problems that cannot be resolved immediately just by giving more money. Of course money helps the process of solving problems, but funds are not the only issue for success in development policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A second very important issue is aid effectiveness. Poorly organised assistance can lead to dependence or, as some people say, the modernisation of dependence. Effectiveness of aid is just as important for recipients as it is for those granting the aid. For recipients of aid, because, after all, money is not an aim in itself, its purpose is to change reality and to hasten the achievement of the Millennium Goals. It is easy to spend money, the trick is to spend it sensibly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For donors, on the other hand, effectiveness is important, because they have to show taxpayers that development expenditure is being spent wisely. Thus these two processes, an increase in development expenditure and an increase in the quality of this expenditure, are not contradictory and can be achieved simultaneously.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Van Hecke has prepared an excellent report for which he deserves our thanks. I hope that, with this report, the representatives of the European Union at the High Level Forum in Accra will have a clear and unequivocal standpoint.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems that a particularly important responsibility for the European Union in this regard should be continued harmonisation of assistance for Member States and the EU. This is important because this issue is exclusively up to us. Coordination inside the EU does not depend on our international partners, nor on those to whom we provide aid and the costs of uncoordinated aid are very high.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I congratulate Mr Van Hecke on this important report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To improve the effectiveness of European aid it is essential to invest in human and financial capacity and to overcome the inconsistencies between policies and the institutional architecture. The Lisbon Treaty opens up an opportunity by creating the European External Action Service. Besides supporting the future High Representative, this service must be equipped to carry EU development policy forward in parallel to CFSP and ESDP.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel to guarantee aid effectiveness. It is dependent on fulfilling promises already made. As Commissioner Michel has stressed, the Member States must increase public development aid to the levels promised in 2005 without inflating them by writing off debts, and must effectively direct it towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in an era in which rising oil and food prices make combating poverty in the world an even more urgent matter.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, what is at stake is the credibility of the European Union and its effectiveness as a global player, rather than the effectiveness of aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Van Hecke on this report. A few weeks ago I visited the IMF and the World Bank on behalf of the Committee on Development and at that meeting I asked what the world would be like between 2030 and 2050. The response I got was that China will be the most powerful country in the world; many of the developing countries will have changed; America will still be powerful, but not as powerful as it is today; India and Brazil will be very powerful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Never before have our selfish interests and our selfless interests coincided as they do now with the need to assist the developing world. In the past I used to be told that I spent too much time with my individual constituents who had poor housing conditions. My response to that was that you cannot tell somebody who is on fire that we are going to build a fire station. You have to plan for the fire station, but you have to help the individual at the same time. This has to be our approach to the developing world. If we do not do it, China and others are going to do it. It is our selfish interest as well as our selfless interest to do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I come from a country which in recent history suffered famine, where the population today should be over 20 million. It has gone over six million for the first time since the mid-19th century. We have a post-colonial past. If you look at Ireland’s history, what we have been able to do with investment in infrastructure, largely from the European Union – to which we are now about to become, thank God, a net contributor – is an indication of what can be done when you give people the tools with which to do the job.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge the Commissioner, when he goes to this meeting in Accra, to make sure that the European Union is singing off the same hymn sheet. Lisbon will give us the instruments with which to play a more effective role in the world. Make sure we do it in the area of development aid. It is in our interests as well as in the interests of the people in the developing world.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Van Hecke, for a good report. I also thank the Commissioner for a particularly sound staff working paper for Accra.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Three points. Firstly, more effective aid indeed requires the donor countries to coordinate their aid better on the basis of a country strategy in which the partner countries in the south take the lead. However, that means that the priorities also have to be decided democratically in those countries, that is to say in cooperation with national parliaments and NGOs, which does not happen at the moment. It seems to me absolutely essential to involve women in the dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, donor countries absolutely have to stop imposing innumerable conditions on aid and staking a lot on measurable results. The economic conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank in particular have to go, because they often conflict with the Millennium Goals. I therefore say to the rapporteur that paragraph 28 in the report should go.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, better aid is no excuse for less aid. At the moment not only is development aid falling, the figures are also confused by what is supposedly aid but is not really much help to the partner countries, such as money paid to students or refugees in Europe or cancellation of debts. It is therefore crucial for the donor countries to stick to their promises of the 0.7% and decide on concrete timetables. I hope, Commissioner, that the Council on Monday listens to this message.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Sometimes the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Such an intention was that of the authorities in the countries beneficiary of development assistance, namely to bring the decision-making process closer to them, motivating that they know best what their needs are. Correct in itself, the decision has generated a vicious circle with negative effects for women. Since they are little present in the decision-making documents, their needs are considered minor, and the gender sensitivity of those in power is low, even lower than ours and the attention given to programmes designed for these needs, especially sexual and reproductive rights, has decreased. Thus, we are witnessing a dramatic situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The only development objective for which no progress has been recorded is maternal mortality generated by the absence of elementary conditions, such as the possibility of a caesarean section, basic antibiotics, contraceptive pills or qualified personnel. In some cases, the situation has become worse. Maternal death is the main cause of women’s mortality in many countries with a fragile situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We request monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the investment in infrastructure includes health infrastructure and the responsibilization of authorities for implementing measures in this field.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing today is particularly important, because it concerns a special responsibility of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in Europe are in no doubt that our small and medium-sized enterprises represent a highly successful structural model, and we must ensure that per capita GDP can grow on the basis of that model in the least developed countries. Great importance attaches in this context to the concept of helping people to help themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also see to it that our energy-efficiency and food-security strategies are at the heart of these efforts. Those countries need income from employment, and small enterprises and family businesses can help to provide that, and they need purchasing power for consumers. I believe this chicken-and-egg principle simply has to be pursued to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="et">Colleagues, I congratulate the rapporteur on a good piece of work. Unsatisfactory coordination of aid and a plethora of programmes have led to a drop in aid effectiveness. At the same time aid has been focused on so-called ‘attractive countries’ and many regions have thereby been completely forgotten. Fragmentation has led to a multiplicity of aid measures, which in several cases are wholly inconsistent with each other.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is, however, of great importance for the European Union and the development cooperation policy of the Member States to complement and strengthen each other. The Member States must coordinate their activities. Consideration should be given to the fact that several Member States are only starting out as aid donors, yet even they are aware of aid effectiveness. For example Estonia, which has not yet adhered to the Paris Declaration, has been prominent in tripartite cooperation projects. To prevent fragmentation of development aid and excessive focus by donors the silent partner option is used.</p>
      <p sl="et">More than half the world’s formal development aid originates in the European Union. It is important to ensure the European Union’s presence in weak countries and especially in ‘forgotten’ countries. When granting aid we, the European Union, should be generous so that the aid can be accepted with dignity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">However, there is always a dilemma in sending funds and resources to developing countries, to poor countries to help them develop. How much of these resources should be allocated to reducing today’s poverty and how much money should be allocated for development purposes such as education, the creation of various institutions, the introduction of a legal system or the construction of infrastructure such as roads or the internet, which would help entrepreneurship to develop in these areas, particularly as regards the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises, including farms?</p>

    <intervention id="4-074" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thank you for your support for the approach and main thrust of our policies. I would like to come back to a few points and reply briefly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, regarding food aid, in particular the rising price of cereals and the question of agricultural programmes, let me tell you that we have just finalised a communication on a European development strategy to respond to the food crisis. You will soon be receiving information about that document.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I would like to correct some of the things that have been said, and I do not understand why they are constantly being asserted. Unilateral attacks on the common agricultural policy, based on very few real arguments, harm the European Union, convey false information and suggest to our partners that the common agricultural policy is the cause of all their woes. I say and I repeat: that is not true! We have been dismantling the system of agricultural subsidies since 1996 and the effects of our common agricultural policy cannot now be regarded as the cause of the developing countries’ troubles. I am prepared to discuss this question in detail at another meeting, because the accusation is being repeated like a sort of refrain, as though it were true. People are saying things that are not accurate. Europe has to a large extent sorted this issue, though there are still some questions that remain; I admit that there is some doubt about the coherence of our development policies. In regard to agriculture, however, if there is one sector where we have made real progress, it is that one. I do find it rather unfair of people to tarnish our image without good cause.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have listened to the proposal concerning, I believe, a global fund. I know that Professor Geoffrey Sachs, who is incidentally a remarkable man, is fighting and campaigning for a global food fund. For my part, I am not in favour. I have strong hesitations about that; after all, it took a long time for the Global Fund to which Mr Ryan referred and which he seemed to think was a panacea, to work transparently and effectively. Why set up another fund when we have instruments such as the WFP, the FAO and others? Inventing new tools and instruments to tackle global policy weaknesses is certainly not the right answer. The tools exist. They simply need to be funded adequately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to reform the WFP, but how? The WFP must have a predictable annual budget and its financial operation must change. I spoke of that recently. It is a major problem. So we must not invent bad replies to good questions either. I am not in favour of creating a new fund because it would simply lead to a lot of red tape, a lot of procedures. On the subject of procedures, let me say a few words.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In regard to agriculture, let me simply tell you that we will be moving from EUR 650 million in the ninth EDF to EUR 1 250 000 billion in the tenth EDF. I agree that is a lot in quantitative, percentage terms, but it is not a real increase in terms of the percentage of EDF funding. The positive aspect is that we have moved from four countries choosing to focus on the agricultural sector to 24 countries, i.e. more or less one third. That shows things have progressed, there is a greater awareness. Let me remind you, however, because this is important, that the choice of focal sectors is based in principle on ownership: it is our partners who decide on which sector they want us to focus our funding. It is important to remember that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next I was asked an interesting question: what will you do with the unused money intended for agriculture? In fact we will recover a large part of that money and allocate it to resolving the problem of rising prices and the food crisis. I prefer to speak of a food crisis, rather than of rising prices. At the Commission’s last meeting a week ago I proposed – a proposal that was very well received – that we should try to channel those resources in such a way as to give small farmers in poor countries access to seeds and fertilisers, because that is one of the biggest problem facing them today. If we want them to become self-sufficient, they obviously need better access to seeds and fertilisers, which would help them gradually to become self-sufficient in food. I am very much in favour of reducing the period during which aid is distributed as much as possible. I believe it is far more important to provide the farmers with the means of production. We all agree, as I said in my opening statement and need not repeat: Accra is a political rendezvous and I ask you – knowing that you are all aware that we have to do this – to mobilise our Member States so that they deliver on their commitments and agree to observe a calendar that demonstrates, as I believe Mr Borrell said, that they have a real political resolve and will keep their promises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">People keep talking about cumbersome procedures and asking me to streamline them. I must admit that I really have no powers in that respect. The procedures exist and I have to observe them; I can do no other. I can propose flexibility measures, but you know full well that it would take years for them to take effect. It is not widely known, but at the end of my term of office I intend to present all the lessons I have learned as regards procedures. I hear Mrs Martens say: ‘We need greater transparency’ – and I am ready for all the transparency you want – ‘but we also need greater effectiveness’. Let me tell you, however impertinent and shocking it may sound, that if you want even more transparency, which means even more controls, even more audits, even more consultations and so on, you will have less effectiveness. That is what I want to say to you. You may dismiss it, but I am convinced that is the case. So much transparency is now demanded that the Commission has become a chained giant, another Gulliver. Personally, I am prepared to talk and there are ways of achieving an effective level of transparency, but I beg you, do not keep talking about ‘transparency’, ‘control’, about how things should be … That is all very well and good, but you must face the facts … I would like to have the chance to trace the journey of a dossier. I can tell you it is no joke. Sometimes even I am at a complete loss to trace its journey, and then you have to remember the inter-services and all the others involved. It is an extremely complicated business. I do not want to caricature it, but I must say it is a real problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe Mr Hutchinson spoke of coordination, coherence and complementarity. He was quite right. I believe we could hugely increase the effectiveness of our aid if we had a better division of labour, if we were more coherent, more coordinated, and if we could indeed cut back on some of the intermediate, and often entirely useless, controls. I gave you a few figures earlier on: Tanzania has to produce 8 000 audit reports! I am not sure what sort of burden that represents for a country like Tanzania, which actually has a capacity for governance. There comes a time when surrealism verges on madness. There are limits. I have nothing against procedure, but enough is enough. I want no more procedure. Mr Hutchinson, in regard to the division of labour, you were right to emphasise the importance of the diaspora. We are trying to work with them, but it is precisely because of the procedures that we cannot do so. That is another example! You asked whether there are any projects to encourage young people to go and work in developing countries. No Sir, I cannot do so, the procedures do not authorise me to do so. I am told, for example, that there are certain NGOs with whom you cannot work. Indeed, I cannot work with certain NGOs because the procedures do not allow me to do so. Our new Member States may feel frustrated, and rightly so, because in most cases their NGOs, even though they are as good as the others, cannot work because they do not comply with the standards invented by Commission’s procedures. In a sense, they are, therefore excluded from our cooperation and our contribution, which is not fair. We are working on this, but it will take a long time to resolve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also agree that we need more. Mr Buzek spoke of combating climate change. Clearly, if we adjust the funding for development in order to work on climate change, we will be mortgaging all that we have done or intended to do in traditional development policy. That means we need new, additional resources to tackle climate change. Let me refer you to the idea we and Mr Borrell put forward, of setting up an international loan that would be tied to CO2 emission quotas. That project is making good progress. Technically, it has been finalised. We worked with the World Bank. I shall be returning to this subject later, because it might also partly resolve the question of increased funding, in that it would help the Member States to meet their objectives and commitments in a way that would be less painful for their budgets in the long run.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously I at one with Mr Borrell in congratulating, first of all, Spain, because it is true that in a sense it is unfair. Some countries have made real efforts and allocated increased budget funds: in terms of its GDP, Spain has indeed made a huge effort. At the same time, some other countries really were in free fall, which in a sense eclipsed the actions of certain others. I must say that this is an important issue that arises again and again: 20% for education, health, water, etc. You know the reply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I have already replied. Even if I agree as to the objective, I did say one must try to establish where budgetary aid expenditure – since the word budgetary was used – actually goes, because those are often the sectors that are funded. It is very difficult to give definite figures, however.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, it is our partner countries that choose the sector on which they focus, not us. So I cannot impose and tell them they have to spend on, say, education. I can suggest but I cannot impose. Of course I agree with Mr Mitchell that – to put it very baldly – we should increase our aid for selfish reasons. That is more or less true. I often point it out at meetings. Let those who do not want to give more aid for selfless reasons at least do so for their selfish interests. In this context, and looking in particular at Africa, we find that certain emerging countries have an extremely large presence there. I do not dispute the legitimacy or validity of their presence there, I am simply saying that it would be in Europe’s interest to have a somewhat stronger presence in a continent that is our neighbour and to which it can offer much added value while also drawing added value from it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think I have covered everything now. I have replied to the two questions put by the last speaker, which were, if I may say so, very pertinent. I am really happy to be in the European Parliament. It is certainly the place with the most dynamism and the greatest determination to drive forward all these policies in which we believe with such conviction.</p>

      <p sl="nl">This high-level constructive debate today has revealed a wide consensus, both in Parliament and between Parliament and the Commission, on the action we have to take to improve the quality of our aid. More account must be taken of the priorities of the countries themselves. The aid needs to be more predictable. Technical assistance must be cut further. More budgetary support is needed, but also greater transparency and involvement by parliaments, the social midfield and local authorities. The code of conduct needs to be more effective and the Donor Atlas has to be extended, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, in my view the crux of the matter is that we, Parliament and the Commission – and why should we not involve the national parliaments as well? – need to put pressure on the Member States so that, first and foremost, they stick to their promises and, secondly, approve a plan in which they indicate very clearly what can and will be done within what period of time. Thirdly, they also have to involve themselves clearly in the division of labour proposed by the Commission. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that, with our friends and colleagues in the national parliaments, disregarding party boundaries, we should take the initiative in stepping up the pressure on the governments, which indeed concerns not just the joint but also the individual responsibility of a number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report contains a whole series of concrete recommendations. I sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will take these with them to Accra. Parliament is speaking with one voice here today, something that does not always happen, and is expressing the wish that the European Union in Accra will also speak with one voice, a clear voice, a loud voice, and above all a credible voice.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since it is not possible to comment on the variety of important issues this report raises – both positive and negative – it should be noted that it nevertheless exposes, albeit in qualified form, the negative performance of EU ‘development aid’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although it does not criticise how often development aid is used merely as a palliative, a (false) counterpart and condition for deregulating markets or as an instrument of interference – with well-known negative aims and effects, such as the EU’s ‘European Consensus’ on development, the Economic Partnership Agreements the EU intends to impose or financial speculation surrounding foodstuffs, which call into question the aims declared for development – the report not surprisingly highlights the inadequate results of ‘development aid’ and its significant reduction in the EU: 0.38% in 2007 compared to 0.41% in 2006, well below the 0.7% of GDP indicated by the UNO.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report also sounds a note of caution against the growing use of ‘development aid’ for purposes that have nothing to do with development (such as military spending), and against the fact that it is ‘often disbursed according to donors’ own priorities and timetables’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In 2005, the Paris Declaration established specific commitments to promote enhanced development aid effectiveness, on the basis of dialogue and mutual accountability. That international framework is essential for the EU, which provides more than 55% of total world development aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With a view to further improving the quality and effectiveness of that aid, the EP is also calling for the simplification of procedures, measures to combat corruption and disbursement of the aid in line with the partners’ own priorities. Those measures are all the more necessary at a time when Member States’ development aid has fallen somewhat, from 0.41% to 0.38% of the EU’s GNP between 2006 and 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the food crisis is affecting the most fragile developing countries and access to water and education remains restricted, it is understandable that the EU must redouble its efforts to achieve the MDG objective of allocating 0.7% of its GNP to development aid by the year 2015. Similarly, to ensure that the aid takes the form of long-term and predictable financing, it is vital to release additional resources by means of innovative financing mechanisms and to mobilise sovereign wealth funds for productive investment.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">In response to a proposal from the Working Group on the Middle East, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament has been following with deep concern the latest political developments in Lebanon, where progress seemed to have stalled and violence and bloodshed had become increasingly rife.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is therefore with a great sense of relief and optimism that we welcome the comprehensive and fundamental agreement which has been concluded in Doha by the Lebanese political leaders at a time when the European Parliament is in the process of adopting a resolution on Lebanon. There is a compromise text, which will shortly be put to the vote, with Mr Onesta presiding.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the cost of food is increasing and will continue to increase and there will be increasing problems with food supply. There are a number of reasons for the fact that there will be food shortages and that there will be more people needing food, and even starving. The first reason is, primarily, the increased population growth in third countries. The second is insufficient production of food and poor distribution. The third is that various interest groups are playing the markets. The fourth is the Common Agricultural Policy, which has resulted in significant reductions in food production in new Member States. Until this policy is changed, until we free food production and our reserves, then this, too, will contribute to food shortages and higher prices. The fifth reason relates to the various natural disasters over which we have no control, but which, unfortunately, result in great losses and complications.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a single conclusion: the problem of food is the most important problem, as, after all, it affects biological survival. It requires full solidarity, not just in the European Union, but also in the entire world. For this reason it has my support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Recently we have seen a worrying increase in food prices in world markets. When food prices rise and, in addition, there is a significant increase in energy prices, this causes increased inflation. Politicians and economists are trying to analyse this situation and identify the causes. The following seem to be the main factors: changes in the global economy, including higher energy prices, reduced harvests and the production of biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Increased demand for food and increased affluence of the inhabitants in fast-growing countries such as India or China have also had an impact on rising food prices. Higher food prices affect both producers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Changes in global food markets force us to think seriously about our food security strategy, or perhaps even rethink it entirely. What is most important, however, is to undertake steps aimed at improving the situation on food markets, not just by ad hoc activities, but actions that will lead to long-term stability.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Too little attention has been given to stability in production levels and to maintaining appropriate quantities of reserves, which would limit the effects of fluctuations in production levels caused by climate change or other factors.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In 2001 the Council exempted US citizens from the visa requirement. Unfortunately, a comparable exemption does not apply to all EU citizens. The US still maintains the visa requirement for nationals of some Member States (currently Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia). More than 10% of visa applications are rejected. According to the applicants, the process is often based on non-transparent criteria.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the one hand, there is the rule that since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 the Council has been responsible for establishing the rules on EU visa policy. On the other hand, there is the rule that the US conducts only bilateral negotiations for including countries in the visa waiver programme, since this is in accordance with its national legislation and only individual countries – not international communities – may enter this programme.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome the European Parliament’s resolution on negotiations between the European Union and the United States, which is the result of intense debates in the European Parliament.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the principles of solidarity, cooperation and non-discrimination as regards nationality are fundamental to the European Union. The visa policy of the USA and the accompanying requirements have, however, somewhat shaken these principles. Member States are forced into separate negotiations concerning issues that, in large part, fall within the competence of the Community.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of visa restrictions particularly affects the new Member States which, although they themselves do not apply restrictions or other requirements as regards the United States, cannot, as can be seen, count on reciprocity from that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This issue is not one that can be resolved individually by each country acting for itself. What is needed here are detailed regulations covering all EU countries. I should point out that if the visa policy of the United States does not change, this will certainly affect transatlantic relations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the problem of animal disease is growing and there are several reasons for this. The first of these is the increase in the size of farms and the associated concentrations of animals. The second is a lack of measures to combat animal diseases effectively.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We could resolve the first problem by restricting breeding in large farms and herds using legal and administrative means and by introducing a support system for smaller farms, especially family-run farms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second undoubtedly depends on the necessary funds being made available from the European Union budget for combating animal diseases. Obviously there are also other very important causes that should not be underestimated, such as: animal transport, unsatisfactory early warning systems, insufficient preventative measures being taken, which includes inoculation.</p>

The Commission’s initiative regarding a change in the approach to animal health and the previous strategy have shown unequivocally that it is vital to work on improving regulations in this area, to improve coherence with other policies and to increase legislative effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new approach proposed in the strategy will make it possible to minimise the risk of infectious diseases breaking out in animals. I know this problem very well, also in my capacity as a veterinarian. It will also promote growth in the economy, make European farmers and companies more competitive and provide new access to export markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is more, appropriate standards of animal health and safety are a guarantee of proper trade policy within the Community. This policy, which has changed under the influence of a series of severe crises and disease outbreaks that took place over the last few years, has shown that a careful analysis needs to be made of the measures taken to date. I believe that, thanks to this proposal, the European Union will promote science, innovation and research to ensure the provision of better measures for combating animal diseases.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The second amendment that was introduced into the budget for 2008 contains, as usual, several elements that have no logical connection with each other. This is often a characteristic of amending budgets and it makes it more difficult to assess the proposal. The basic issue, however, is the quality of the justification provided as well as the proposal’s procedural compliance with the Financial Regulations. It is completely justifiable to include in the 2008 budget unused ERDF, EAFRD and EFF structural funds (totalling EUR 771.6 million), which corresponds with both the wording and the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006, when we anticipated delays in the implementation of the new Financial Perspective. When voting for this budget amendment we can note with some satisfaction that over 500 out of 580 operational programmes for 2007-2013 have already been approved, which means we are passing into the realisation phase in this current seven-year period. The Parliament rapporteur also agrees with the modifications to the framework plans of two agencies, namely the European Medicines Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, in accordance with the submission from the European Commission, which constitutes a supplementary part of the initial budget amendment proposal no 2/2008. This kind of supplement is accepted more readily than the tendency to multiply the EU’s executive and regulatory agencies.</p>

      <p sl="it">The strategic attempt to revive European competitiveness, proposed in the Lisbon strategy and reiterated recently at the Competitiveness Council of November 2007, has led the EU to intensify its efforts to enhance European potential for innovation and growth in the face of world competition.</p>
      <p sl="it">SMEs are the key to a genuine revival of research and development activity because by their very nature they are spurred on towards innovation in their struggle to survive in the marketplace. However, access to R&amp;D activities can sometimes be particularly burdensome in economic and bureaucratic terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore endorse this report, which emphasises the need for the EU to apply the ‘think small first’ principle and to boost the potential for innovation and originality of SMEs, which are still one of the main drivers of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that a policy to promote small enterprise should incorporate subsidies and essential aid for research: examples of this are the ‘Best’ programme, which has facilitated an exchange of best practices between SMEs, the CIP and the 7-initiative policy framework. However, I also think it is essential to adopt a series of measures aimed at promoting entrepreneurship, such as reduction of barriers to the internal market, elimination of bureaucratic obstacles and facilitation of bank loans to SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">While it is true that industry in the EU is responsible for over 80% of private sector R&amp;D expenditure and that its innovative products represent some 73% of EU exports, the report in fact advocates the creation of an open and competitive internal market in services and industry. This is in the interests only of the large economic groups, since it may jeopardise micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and a high percentage of jobs. This in turn may affect the income of workers and many small-scale business people, and therefore their activity as consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, we also disagree with the strengthening of the role of the EU defence sector, even if this may have an impact on expanding the arms industry. Our proposal for progress and social development is consistent with peace rather than war.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report because of the importance it attaches to issues that I consider to be fundamental, i.e. the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Since they represent over 90% of European business, SMEs not only have an economic role within the Union but also a social role because of their significant contribution to jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Initiatives such as the European Commission's effort to cut the unnecessary bureaucracy faced by these companies by 25% and the promotion of investment in the quality of human resources and in research are therefore to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The industrial sector in the EU still has great potential for improvement, both in the delivery of research and innovation in business opportunities and in anticipating such opportunities to ensure more rapid adaptation to changes in the market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Improving the regulatory framework, particularly as regards patents, so as to facilitate access to the internal market and to foster European entrepreneurship are key factors for increasing our industrial competitiveness. In this context it seems to me that the promotion of regional clusters is also very positive.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am happy that, in this context, special attention has been paid to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, which, after all, constitute 99.8% of the companies in Europe. It is just these companies that most feel the effects of excessive bureaucracy. Calculated on a per capita basis, small companies incur, on average, costs that are ten times higher than those of large companies as regards the responsibilities imposed by legal regulations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, SMEs can experience greater difficulties than large companies in accessing markets. Let us not forget that it is SMEs, through their innovation and flexibility, that provide a significant boost to economic growth and improvements in the competitiveness of European business. For this reason it is extremely important to develop solutions that will help to reduce administrative burdens, increase SME access to the internal market and public tenders and help them respond to new challenges. The Small Business Charter that has been announced by the Commission is to include these kinds of proposals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with the rapporteur’s view that an improvement in regulatory conditions at European level must be combined with commitment from Member States. Without national steps to reduce the administrative burden it will not be possible to achieve measurable economic benefits.</p>

      <p sl="fr">the growth in the cultivation of crops for energy purposes, at the expense of essential food crops;</p>

      <p sl="fr">Over and above emergency measures, when we report on the health of the CAP we must redefine the way we intervene on the world markets (infrastructure, intervention stocks, risk management, prospects and economic modelling of price changes, etc.), reconsider the decoupling of aid and globally rethink our agricultural production models to ensure that they are productive and enduring.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The negative effect of the last CAP reform is well known, particularly the untying of aid from production. It is therefore particularly serious that in the prevailing circumstances the total withdrawal of payments associated with production that still exists has been announced (with the sole exception of suckler cows, goats and sheep). These payments have been transferred to the single payment scheme, at the same time as progress is being made in the gradual dismantling of significant common market organisations and in dismantling the milk quota system, and in withdrawing intervention in areas such as durum wheat, rice and pigmeat, further promoting the abandonment of the land and farming.</p>

After serving on the Parliament’s Budget Committee for eight years, where I became well-versed in the anomalies of the CAP, I believe such a move would be counterproductive. It would raise world food prices at a time of crisis and do nothing for the long-term health of European agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, rising food prices do not only affect poorer nations. The EU must now take action in order to stabilise this situation. First and foremost, we should be encouraging our farmers to produce more. Moreover, a more sensible balance regarding the use of grain for food supply and energy production needs to be achieved.

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the resolution on rising food prices in the European Union and in developing countries. This is a problem that affects the whole world. There are many causes for this situation. They include increased demand for food, rising fuel prices, natural disasters (especially droughts), reduced acreage devoted to plants for human or animal consumption (the price of increasing the area of land designated for so-called energy agriculture) and so on. For this reason I would support the UN’s proposal for a moratorium on biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What can also be seen is financial speculation on food markets. Another contributing factor is the issue of the erroneous and unnecessary quotas that restrict agricultural production, for example the milk quotas that place limits on the production of milk and milk products in Poland. Tragic consequences in the poorest countries result in food from our surpluses being given away for free or sold at token prices. This kind of aid is only helpful in times of catastrophes and disasters. Otherwise it completely destroys their farmers, since it is not worth their while either to grow crops or to keep animals. Fast-rising food prices combined with unemployment could also lead to social instability in these countries.</p>

We need to propose emergency measures to bring an end to the famine that is at this very moment afflicting the most vulnerable people in the developing countries. In addition to those emergency measures, which cannot resolve the problem in the long term, the EU must formulate a strategy, in agreement with international organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the FAO and the WTO.

On the other hand, it is not the job of the EU to condemn and exhort other countries to put pressure on Burma to open its borders. It is also not up to the EU to call on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the Government of Burma.

When I met local environment activists in Kazakhstan, what seemed obvious in the West took on a new dimension from my standpoint.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Aarhus Convention is a major achievement in the aim to improve public participation and access to information rights and is a component in any successful system of democracy, and that is why I well understand Parliament’s position in which also the missing element, the right of the public to appeal, should be restored. I can sympathise, however, with the Council when it says it fears that citizens’ rights could be abused when it comes to lodging an appeal in order to slow down projects or establish a level playing field for fund-raising campaigns staged by organisations. The Council is right to be worried about this exploitation of democracy.

      <p sl="pt">By not calling the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) into question, merely referring to the need not to make development aid available only to countries that accept greater liberalisation of their markets, every positive aspect that might arise out of such aid has been abandoned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">EPAs set conditions on the sovereignty of countries, impose a model that favours EU multinationals, and make the production of countries conditional not on the many particular needs of their people but, on the contrary, on the requirements of an increasingly liberalised market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, considering it positive that military expenditure should be excluded from the scope of development aid, that effective resources should be devoted to developing and improving public services, that the diversion of aid towards objectives that have nothing at all to do with development should be ceased once and for all, these measures will only be effective if at the same time we reject the liberalisation of trade and the instruments of domination and interference set out in the EPAs.</p>

      <p sl="es">Second, because more effectiveness and transparency is requested when discussing the funding of projects. Of course we want effectiveness. However, transparency means more audits, more consultations, more controls – in brief, more waste of time and money on bureaucracy, and this slows down rather than facilitates the work of MANY people.

      <p sl="en">I welcome Mr Van Hecke's follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness. The aid system must remain true to its primary goal of reducing poverty. Indeed, for aid to be effective it must make use of local systems and fully engage with the recipient.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Paris Declaration of 2005 established an international aid effectiveness programme based, primarily, on eliminating poverty. The document contains specific obligations that are aimed at increasing aid effectiveness on the basis of international cooperation. It would appear that this will be effective aid in the full meaning of these words and that those who require this aid will receive it and will not have to pay for it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately it does happen that persons receiving ‘aid’ have to pay for it. In many cases this is an instrument to make the weak economically dependent on the strong, and the poor dependent on the rich. At the beginning of the sixties an Indian who saw the ‘aid’ being provided by developed countries to his own country said at a meeting of the World Food Organisation ‘for the love of God, stop helping us’.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, once again we are returning to the topic of Sudan and what can be done to call the Government there to account for the suffering of the people of that country, and indeed for the effects on neighbouring states.</p>
      <p sl="en">This afternoon’s resolution particularly concerns the International Criminal Court, and the fact that, over a year ago now, two arrest warrants were issued by that Court for Ahmad Haroun, the Minister of the Interior at the time, who is now the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs – which I think many of us find deeply shocking – and also for one of the former Janjaweed militia leaders, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen absolutely no cooperation from the Sudanese Government in handing these people over to the International Criminal Court, although that Government is well aware that membership of the United Nations carries with it obligations. We are seeing an ongoing culture of impunity, where nobody is ever brought to account, it seems, for the most appalling crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider that all governments should be taking a strong stance on this, and the resolution says that we should be calling on the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June to adopt targeted EU punitive measures against a clearly identified group of Sudanese officials who bear responsibility for this non-cooperation, with that action including clear financial sanctions – it appears that when the cries of people do not work, maybe stopping the flow of money will.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group commends this resolution to the House. We look forward to firm action and hopefully seeing these men, and others, brought to justice.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, a year ago we also had an urgent debate about Sudan. Since then the situation has become worse, not better. The agreement between the Islamic north and the non-Islamic south, reached after a long internal war, is under pressure. The temporary cooperation in a transitional government and preparation of the referendum on independence for the south in 2011 are under pressure because the borders of those areas have not been finally demarcated. Control of the oil-rich middle area is now the cause of further violence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Also, the peace settlement does not apply to west Darfur, since Arab nomads and solders have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad. This is a conflict not between supporters of Islam and Christianity, but between nomads and the settled agricultural population for control of arid land that produces very little. Because of population growth and desertification, the people are losing their traditional sources of livelihood and turning against each other. The government is also responsible for driving out the originally non-Arab population. There is now fighting from Darfur back as far as the capital, Khartoum.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Even when what is now Sudan was known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, it was debatable whether this huge area with widely differing populations should become independent as a single state. A unified state would mainly be the state of the Arab populations in the north, east and centre. It would be difficult for the black Islamic population in the west and the black Christians and animists in the south to gain an equal position. The regions that were at the time much less developed were far from the sea and were given very little international attention. Ultimately no one took any notice of them and we are now seeing the results of colonial shortsightedness.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The state is responsible for many crimes, but at the same time it is largely an instrument for one of the warring parties. That makes it difficult for it to cooperate with punitive measures. Obviously we are trying to keep the prospect of that open in the resolution, but in the current situation there is little cause for optimism.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is really shocking that the Sudanese government has appointed Mr Haroun (the former interior minister responsible for Darfur during 2003-2004) as the minister for humanitarian affairs. It is a sick joke that he has been given responsibility for the lives and security of the inhabitants of Darfur, when it was the same person who had persecuted them earlier, and that decisions concerning the largest humanitarian operation run by the UNAMID international peace mission are in his hands. Let us not forget that the purpose of this mission is to protect civilians from crimes, that is, just the kind of actions that Mr Haroun was involved in.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Sudan is an enormous country covering an area of 2.5 million square kilometres, with a population of about 42 million people, that has been destroyed by two civil wars that claimed millions of victims and resulted in disability, degradation, and the destruction of property for many more millions of its inhabitants. One issue that was at the basis of the fratricidal conflicts was ethnic differences – 52% of the population are African, 39% Arab – and religious differences – 70% are Sunni, 30% are animist.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During these wars the population experienced all possible atrocities at the hands of those with armaments and power, including murder, torture, rape, robbery and eviction, crimes that are prosecuted and punished by the International Criminal Court. Unfortunately the ICC does not have the means to bring the perpetrators to justice. The resolution presents the European view as regards the current situation and I support it. I do think, however, that in these circumstances it would be worth considering the use of a more radical approach, for example, using UN special forces to take the accused to the ICC, and then imprisoning those found guilty and interning them for life, with no right of return, on some distant island with some telling name such as Evildoers’ Island. I think that this would help.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the UN estimates that the conflict in Sudan has resulted in about 300 000 deaths and has left approximately 2.5 million refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Reports of untold acts of barbarism taking place in the region have abounded in recent years. The suffering of the innocent civilian population has been extreme. Those that allegedly were responsible for instigating or carrying out war crimes or crimes against humanity should face the law and, if found guilty, must be punished accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not just necessary as a matter of natural justice but also in order to make sure that such individuals are prevented from repeating their crimes and that adequate example is given to other potential criminals to prevent them from carrying out similar crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The International Criminal Court was formed in order to make sure that those that commit war crimes and crimes against humanity do not go unpunished. Sudan has signed the Rome Statute which created the International Criminal Court but has not yet ratified it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is no excuse for not offering this court its full cooperation in according with UN Security Council Resolution 1593. The International Criminal Court issued two arrest warrants against Sudan’s former Minister of the Interior, Mr Ahmad Haroun, and against the militia leader Ali Mohammed Ali Abd-al-Rahman. The warrants relate to 51 counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. For more than a year now the Sudanese authorities have refused to hand over these individuals and are thus obstructing the work of the International Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is absolutely and utterly unacceptable. Such behaviour makes the Sudanese Government an accomplice of these alleged criminals. We call on Sudan to think again, and think fast, about the grave position they have placed themselves in by protecting these alleged mass killers from the arm of international law. We hope they will come to their senses and abide by the request of the International Court immediately.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Since 2003 the conflict in Sudan has claimed 300 000 victims. Two and a half million people have left their homes to escape from the violence. Despite the partial stabilisation in the country, there are constant clashes between government forces and the rebels, which makes it difficult to use UN peacekeeping forces and to provide humanitarian aid. No lasting resolution of the Sudanese conflict will be possible without the involvement of the UN and without the UN increasing the number of soldiers in the region. The recruitment of children into the army and acts of violence against the civilian population, particularly against women, are clear breaches of international standards and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is particularly worrying is the failure of the government to cooperate with the International Criminal Court as well as maintaining war criminals in power, who – and this sounds like some sick joke – are now in charge, among other things, of distributing humanitarian aid as well as contacts with the peacekeepers. A call should be made to Sudan to start cooperating immediately with the Court in order to deal with the war crimes, since this is a necessary condition for the creation of democracy and the rule of law. All attempts to disrupt the peace agreement and the military assistance coming from third countries, for both sides of the conflict, should be condemned.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, since 2003 Sudan has been a battleground due to religious and ethnic differences. The conflict in Darfur resulted in the exodus of over two and half million people. Civilian victims of this conflict have been murdered, beaten and raped. There is widespread hunger and there is a lack of basic hygiene.

A country based on values other than human rights. The situation is critical: over the five years since the start of the Darfur conflict more than 200 000 people have lost their lives. Individuals who have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes live in freedom; some of them have respectable posts in Sudan.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in 2004, the European Union called on the United Nations to set up a Committee of Inquiry into the atrocities and crimes committed in Darfur. On the basis of the recommendations made by this Committee, the European Union asked the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Council did by adopting Resolution 1593 in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the past few months, the European Union has repeatedly called on the Sudanese Government to cooperate unconditionally with the ICC.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 31 March 2008, the anniversary of the Security Council’s referral of the situation in Darfur to the ICC, the EU Presidency adopted a Declaration on behalf of the European Union expressing its outrage at the Sudanese Government’s failure to cooperate with the Court. The European Union also expressed its willingness to support the adoption of new appropriate measures against those persons who bear responsibility for Sudan’s non-cooperation with the ICC, should the Sudanese Government still fail to comply with the UN Resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 6 May 2008, I attended a meeting between donors and the Sudanese Government – the Sudan Consortium – which was held in Oslo. At this meeting, I reminded my Sudanese interlocutors, while addressing the conference, that our development aid is intended to support development in Sudan subject to a genuine democratic transformation taking place in the country, as provided for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. I emphasised that the principles underlying the CPA must likewise apply to Darfur and that there was an urgent need to restore security, deploy the United Nations Mission and facilitate humanitarian access. The recent outbreak of violence in Abyei, a region fraught with complex problems that represent one of the major challenges in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan, emphasises the importance of implementing in full the CPA. I have just published a press release calling on both parties to comply with all CPA provisions, including the establishment of an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of other armed factions from the town of Abyei.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Sudanese Government must know that the international community as a whole will remain faithful to the vision set out in the CPA of a peaceful, stable and democratic Sudan that demonstrates respect for the rule of law and for human rights. This message is not directed solely at the Sudanese Government – it must also be understood by the various armed rebel movements whose political cause, whatever it may be, does not justify committing crimes. The Court has issued a number of arrest warrants, including one against Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militia leader.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The meeting of the UN Security Council, which will take place on 5 June in the presence of the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, may be an important opportunity for the international community to present a united front and to send a strong signal in support of the Court’s work.

      <p sl="pl">Today we are once again discussing breaches of fundamental human rights in Belarus. As usual in such cases, we note what it is that dictators do. Obviously dictators always battle with organised religion, because, very often, this is the biggest voice that the population has. They also always battle with the trade unions. As it happens the trade unions in Belarus are rather weak, so, from this point of view, Lukashenko could seem quite a positive figure, as he does not have anyone to fight against, since they have not yet managed to create trades unions there. In addition, dictators always fight against the opposition that wants to have democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, there is one thing we should also bear in mind: we should remember that Belarus is an important neighbour for the European Union in the East and should be treated as such.

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus deserves to be criticised for using repressive methods, arresting political opponents, using authoritarian governing methods, censorship and isolation of the country. In addition to that, the refusal to grant entry visas prevents Members of the European Parliament and of national parliaments from seeing the situation for themselves. All this is highlighted in my Group’s motion. However, I think that our criticism of breaches of human rights must be measured by absolute criteria, rather than following a political scale of who in the world plays first fiddle at the moment. That is not right. We keep running around in circles; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia. The Romans were always right and their chroniclers painted it as a wrongdoing when an attacked opponent was bold enough to defend himself.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Let me get back to Belarus, however. Lukashenko’s regime is first and foremost an attempt to disrespect the direction in which the Euro-Atlantic initiatives are going. Mr Lukashenko plays in his own narrow field, ignoring the fact that moderate-sized countries cannot behave like that since supranational capital will not allow it. If you do not obey, you will be isolated and the international community will support the opposition within the country. That is how it works and we all know it. Sooner or later Mr Lukashenko and his party machine will pay dearly for acting in this manner. Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO. The present US Administration and the governments of some other countries would very much like Belarus to join NATO, together with Ukraine and Georgia, thereby causing damage to Russia.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Our worries about human rights in Belarus would not be so intense if, in fact, the real issue was not Russia. The question is, however, whether attempts to weaken Russia help the issue of world security. I am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control. Russia has been suppressing them for several millennia.</p>

On the one hand there is the desire that has been publicly and officially declared to normalise relations with the European Union. The opening of the representative office of the European Commission in Minsk is a symbol of this desire.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, in the same month, the police brutally attacked demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of the country’s independence.

Alexander Kazulin, the most important political prisoner, a prisoner of conscience in contemporary Europe, is still in prison.</p>

Without any guarantees for the fundamental rights of free and democratic elections, to express one’s political opinions, freedom of the press and freedom to practise one’s religion, there is no possibility that the European Union should ever recognise the regime in Belarus as a country with which it is worth cooperating, or as a country that it is worth helping.

The reopening of the European Humanities University in Vilnius, a Belarusian university-in-exile that offers a place of refuge for students who are victims of political persecution, was a wise move.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next step must be visa facilitation, for which this House has called on several occasions. It is not right that the EU should further restrict people's freedom of movement by charging a fee of EUR 60 to issue a visa. That is almost a third of a monthly income in Belarus and is therefore unaffordable for many people. What we have managed with Ukraine, Moldova and Russia we should also be able to do with Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Belarus is the only European country which still has a totalitarian administration and where the death penalty is still in existence. President Lukashenko continues to keep a watchful eye on civil society and is unwilling to release his tight grip on the country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Despite everything, the country’s government has said it wants to establish closer relations with the European Union. Once again it is time for us clearly to explain to Belarus the terms of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As the resolution states, the basic preconditions for close cooperation in terms of the European Neighbourhood Policy are the abolition of capital punishment, a free media, freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of religion, a respect for democratic values, and the immediate release of political prisoners. This resolution calling for the immediate release of the members of the opposition who have been arrested is at the same time a show of support and solidarity for all those who are suffering under the current Belarusian regime.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Next week members of Belarus’s political opposition will come here to Parliament to ask the EU to support a petition rejected by Lukashenko to amend the law restricting freedom of religion which took effect in 2002. I hope that this important resolution and next week’s joint debate will persuade the Belarusian Government that it is in its own interests and that of the country’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="et">Colleagues, on Human Rights Day, 10 December, the television broadcasting station Belsat began operating in Poland with the aim of broadcasting independent information on what is happening in Belarus, Europe and elsewhere in the world to Belarusians. The channel, which broadcasts mainly in Belarusian, now reaches some 10% of Belarusians via satellite.</p>
      <p sl="et">The station is working under constant pressure. At the end of March KGB and police in Belarus carried out a raid to apprehend Belsat’s local reporters. Their basic tools, i.e. laptop computers and broadcasting technology, were seized. Independent reporters live in constant fear of interrogation and arrest. The situation in Belarus, an immediate neighbour of the European Union, is as harsh as it was behind the iron curtain. As the Chair of the Moldova delegation and an Estonian, I state here that the citizens of Belarus, which was also part of the Soviet Union, today need independent information as much as they need oxygen. Belsat is an excellent start, but good television does not come cheap.</p>
      <p sl="et">The journalists working for Belsat Belarus are fighting for democracy; they visited us in the European Parliament in March and they need our comprehensive support.

This is reminiscent of the methods used by the Communist authorities against the opposition in Poland. It seemed that, as a result, the situation could be changing for the better, but, as the hero of Ilia Ehrenburg’s well-known story said: ‘If they are releasing, it means that they will be putting new ones in’. Today the prisons are once again full of prisoners that are in prison because of their political convictions, which they expressed in various demonstrations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that there is only one correct response to this, which is to extend the list of persons that are banned from entering European Union countries.

The demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of Belarus’s brief independence and were arrested on 25 March 2008, are still under arrest. Repression is used against the opposition, and journalists have their property confiscated, they get beaten and exiled.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recently Mr Lukashenko expressed the desire to stand again for the Presidency. In addition, for the first time, he tried to blackmail the European Union by reminding us that 50% of the oil, 50% of the oil products and 30% of the gas coming to the European Union passes through Belarus. This is a reference to the Yamal-Europe natural gas pipeline and the ‘Friendship’ oil pipeline.

In this country respect for human rights seems to be very far off. Falsification of election results, elimination of political opposition, arrests, beatings, restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, restrictions on meetings, and, above all, mass surveillance of the population by a highly developed security apparatus – this is the everyday reality faced by the citizens of Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw attention to a deterioration in the situation of many people living near the borders, including the representatives of Polish minorities living there, who, after Poland joined the Schengen Area, have found it very difficult to contact their families living in Poland, especially with the high visa costs.

It is an exceptional country by European standards in that it does not have a liberal democracy or rule of law and it has censorship. Today’s debate takes place on the anniversary of the Prague Spring in 1968, an anniversary of the moment when, in Europe, people finally said ‘enough’ to censorship and press controls.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today I wanted to devote my speech to just this issue in Belarus. We had a very strange hacker attack on independent internet media: on Charter 97, Radio Liberty and the Belarus Partisan. What was strange was the hacker attack began the day before the opposition demonstration that was to take place on the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The internet media in Belarus are really the only independent media as the majority of the media are completely under the control of the Belarus regime. Charter 97 are visited by about 9 000 surfers daily and, in Belarus, over 3 000 000 families are connected to the internet, over 30% of the total population.

It is important for us Poles, as well as for the inhabitants of other neighbouring countries, that there be a stable political and economic situation in the region as this provides the basis for development and improvements in quality of life for our inhabitants. We must also remember that, like Poland, Belarus was forgotten about and handed over to Soviet domination after World War II and could not count on any outside assistance. However, this country managed to become independent and now can boast of a GDP growth of over 8%, and even 9.9% in the years 2003-2006.</p>

      <p sl="de">We urgently need three crucial advances. Firstly, we strongly urge the Government of Belarus to release its political prisoners at long last – not only the political prisoners who have already being detained for some time, like Mr Kazulin, but also the many new ones who have recently been jailed for exercising elementary fundamental rights such as freedom to practise their profession as journalists, freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we call for amendment of the Religion Act and for absolute freedom of religion. There are European Christians who are being repressed here in the heart of Europe, and we in the European Parliament cannot tolerate that. We must therefore resist this with all our might.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, there is an urgent need for us to ensure that Belarus finally opens up to us as Members of the European Parliament and European citizens, that the wall of isolation is breached with which the Belarusian regime has systematically enclosed its people, that we can be present there and discuss matters and that we can help to foster something like a Belarusian Spring, 40 years after the Prague Spring.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the positive momentum generated in Belarus by the release of five of the six political prisoners appears to have stalled. Regrettably, renewed pressure on civil society and a number of particularly harsh and disproportionate sentences have ruined this positive atmosphere. We continue to condemn the political arrests and the way in which civil society and the independent media are being treated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, we must make Belarus understand that we mean what we say when we propose a partnership subject to progress being made with regard to respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, in order to make such progress, Belarus needs to take a number of measures that, for us, are essential. These include the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Alexander Kazulin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They also include the holding of parliamentary elections, scheduled for September, which must comply with democratic principles. In this regard, we ask that the international OSCE/ODIHR observers be granted unhampered access. The Belarusian authorities have informed us of their intention to admit both short-term and long-term observers; we will be sure to hold them to their word. Naturally, the presence of observers from the European Parliament would be an additional source of valuable expertise. It is also vital that opposition parties participate fairly in these elections. We will take into account any suggestions made by Parliament in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, irrefutable evidence that progress has been made would be the presence of opposition in this Parliament, which is not currently the case. In that event, the European Union would be ready to respond positively, as it confirmed only last month in a statement relating to sanctions and to the progress that would encourage us to ease these sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall now address an issue that we feel most strongly about: contacts with the people of Belarus. However regrettable the situation in Belarus may be, we must expand our contacts. Naturally, restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities are still being maintained. Nevertheless, I think that it is necessary to draw a distinction between political and technical levels. Accordingly, the Commission is holding meetings to discuss technical issues such as energy, transport and the environment with experts from the Belarusian administration. These contacts are obviously a means of getting across various messages on matters about which we feel very strongly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that we currently have a delegation in Minsk will also enable us to forge closer links both with the Belarusian administration and with civil society, local NGOs, independent media and students, all of whom we have a duty to assist, as you have rightly pointed out in your report and as several speakers have said. In addition, aid is being provided to the European Humanities University, which is currently in exile in Vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the University is unable to return to Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I should like to broach a subject that comes up time and time again: visas. As you and I are aware, we are unable, as things stand, to open negotiations on the easing of visa restrictions with Belarus – this has been determined by the Council – but this does not prevent us from taking advantage of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States under the Schengen rules as part of their consular prerogatives.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initially, we did not wish Parliament to consider right now the situation in Burundi, for, as you know, the Burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the FNL, the National Liberation Forces; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should, we hope, lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in Dar es Salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting, violence and insecurity affecting the country. As we now know, the beating of a butterfly’s wings in Strasbourg may sometimes unleash a hurricane thousands of miles away.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, not to speak of the situation of this small country that has been orphaned in terms of its development, having been stripped of its natural resources of the kind that often attract donors, would have been unthinkable. Therefore, in agreement with the other political groups, we wanted to make this resolution into a call for positive action with regard to this associated country situated in the troubled Great Lakes Region. We wanted to reiterate the EU’s determination, and especially that of Parliament and of yourself, Commissioner, to seek new solutions for development aid that are more effective in those countries that are weakened by situations of conflict – in this instance, civil war – countries where issues such as the process of democratic reconstruction, the restoration of destroyed public services and the relaunch of policies on matters as fundamental as health and education might be addressed and supported more effectively and more rapidly. We wanted this resolution to form part of the action plan that the Netherlands has been asked to develop for Burundi, which has been selected – and we are delighted that it has been so selected – as one of three pilot countries under this new approach. Therefore, we have made our wishes clear. We want Burundi to become a model of development and, in order to achieve this, we want the authorities of this small country to be provided with the financial resources and support required for civil, political and economic reconstruction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament will monitor developments very closely, but it also wishes to call on Burundian MPs from all political groupings to seek, as a matter of urgency, ways and means of bringing their institutions back into operation, after having been prevented from carrying out their work for months, with a view to holding debates and voting, as well as allowing the Burundian Government to implement projects aimed at reconstruction such as the long-awaited reform of the judiciary and that of the healthcare system, among other areas requiring urgent action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we should like to point out that Burundi, one of the world’s poorest countries, receives proportionately the least amount of development aid per capita. This cannot continue. We should like to request that additional financial resources be released quickly to finance priority development programmes and, in particular, the rebuilding of shattered infrastructure. Along with the EU, only five Member States are represented in Burundi, a country where everything remains to be done. We hope that these countries coordinate their efforts effectively prior to any decision-making in Europe’s capital cities and that the delegations on the ground in Burundi entrusted with implementing development policies continue working together and that their staff numbers are increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the paragraph in our resolution which refers to the maintenance of, and possible increase in, much-needed humanitarian aid, and I should also like to urge that arrangements for the withdrawal of this aid be made in close association with the stepping up of development policies whose implementation is more complex. In this connection, we wanted to make the point so as to ensure that the visibility of the measures taken locally by the Burundian authorities, with the backing of the European Union and the Member States, is properly acknowledged. Apart from the resolution of conflict with the FNL and the restoration of greater security, the Burundian people urgently need to see improvements in their country’s development reflected in their troubled daily lives.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the resumption of hostilities in Burundi represents a backward step in what is already a fragile process.</p>
      <p sl="es">Dozens of deaths and thousands more displaced people show that the efforts to build peace are, at least for the moment, clearly not enough. The responsibility for this state of affairs should be shared.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clearly regrettable that the FNL has taken up arms again, but it has to be said that there have been many allegations of human rights violations by the Burundian Armed Forces and police force.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also clear that instability in Burundi could have important and serious consequences for the region, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree that greater stability has come to Burundi since the entry into force of a new constitution followed by general elections. However, this also strengthens the need for the establishment of a peace and reconciliation commission as a confidence-building measure. The European Union must support such an initiative financially and logistically.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is in this context, and especially considering, as has been said, that the European Union has chosen Burundi as a pilot country for the implementation of a priority Action Plan aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of assistance, that I think this resolution deserves special consideration. Not only by the European Commission, but also, and fundamentally, by Member States, and especially two of its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, the proposal to increase the financial resources that the European Union grants to Burundi, notably on the occasion of the mid-term review of the tenth EDF.</p>
      <p sl="es">Second, that within the framework of the much-needed action plan, priority support should be given to programmes for better governance and democratic state management; health policies, through the creation of health centres and the renewal of the hospital network; the decision by the government of Burundi to provide free primary education; and the continuing efforts to renew the country’s infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, just like Sudan, which we were discussing earlier this afternoon, Burundi is an ethnically divided land, with long-standing disharmony between the various population groups.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The resulting problems are much harder to solve in Burundi than in other African countries. It is difficult to draw a geographical border between areas that are typically the territory of different ethnic groups. It is more akin to the caste system that traditionally existed in India. Even before the German and Belgian colonisation, the Hutus were in the majority in Burundi and Rwanda and the Tutsis were in the minority. The Tutsis, who are also recognisably different in appearance from the Hutus, were the rulers. The Hutus were under their control.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the European colonial period attempts were made to change that situation, but not with a view to equality and equal rights for the Hutus. At the time the main aim was to play the two ethnic groups off against each other in order to make the Dutch or Belgian administration stronger. Even after independence, a lasting solution was never found to the old differences. Burundi was spared the massive campaign by the Hutu majority in neighbouring Rwanda to the north to wipe out the troublesome Tutsi minority. However, that might also be due to the fact that emancipation amongst the Hutus was less widespread</p>
      <p sl="nl">When we speak in the resolution about 14 years of civil war, peace negotiations, the opposition movement FNL, the disarming of rebels and the fighting that broke out again on 17 April, we have to be aware of the background and the unresolved problems. The main purpose of the resolution is that the violence should stop and that agreement must be reached. I agree with that, but on that point in particular I see little cause for optimism. The resolution also calls for European support for democratic government, education and health care. We can contribute to that ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, we are very pleased to hear of the reopening of negotiations and peace talks between the National Liberation Forces and the government in Burundi. This is not the first attempt by the rebels and the government to come to an agreement. We are hopeful that the agreement will bring an end to the bloody conflict.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This conflict has not just resulted in innocent victims, but, first and foremost, is destabilising the delicate balance and is increasing tensions in the country, which saw positive results following the peace accord in 2003. After many years of conflict in Burundi, the country is trying to rebuild itself and to return to the international arena and has been achieving some success.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is even more of a paradox is the fact that the problem being experienced by Burundi at present is not caused by Hutu-Tutsi tribal conflict, but has been brought about by a single, very radical, Hutu-FNL wing, which did not accept the peace accord and is still trying to fight the coalition government, which also includes the Hutu. The international community should give its support to the peace agreement and bring about an end to the conflict.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are once again discussing crimes committed in various countries around the world and we will continue these discussions endlessly, until the European Union has a common foreign policy. What is more, a joint foreign policy can only be effective if the European Union has a military force. The Lisbon Treaty, which creates something like a foreign ministry, will not resolve the problem, since there will be no military force.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In his time, President Lech Kaczyński said that the European Union should have its own army. Recently, President Sarkozy also spoke about this. I believe that this issue should be on the agenda for public debate in the European Union. There should be specific proposals for political solutions and, consequently, legal solutions. Without military force there can be no foreign policy. If the integrity and the strength of the EU are important to us, then the European Union has to have its own army in order to be able to intervene in situations such as the one in Burundi.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Burundi has been in a precarious state for a number of years. The scenes of barbarism that took place in the 1990s between the Hutus and the Tutsis will always remain deeply embedded in our minds and will always seriously disturb our conscience. Numerous attempts by the international community, as well as by regional players, have not yet resulted in the much desired long-lasting peace and stability in the area, although it has to be said that much progress has been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent military confrontations between the national defence forces and the National Liberation Front have resulted in the loss of innocent lives and are most disturbing. Both sides must realise that they must resolve their differences at the negotiating table and not on the battlefields. Both must realise that violence will only bring more violence. The rebel group must denounce violence and lay down their arms, but at the same time the Government of Burundi must cease to provide impunity and to cover up for criminals within the security forces who carry out torture and illegal detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us hope that common sense will prevail at last and that the main sides involved in this brutal internal fighting in Burundi will manage to resolve their differences peacefully for the sake of the safety and well-being of the people of their country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in my mind’s eye I see a beautiful country. I see people struggling to emerge from the aftermath of the civil war atrocities. I see those memorials to the violence. I see poor people struggling to cope. I see Bujumbura closed at night, as one tries to get back in before the curfew because of the violence. I see the health problems, the malaria, the respiratory and hygiene problems. I see the refugee camps – people returning, not quite knowing where their homes were, people coming back from Tanzania and people coming across from Kivu in the Congo.</p>
      <p sl="de">And now again of course we see the violence, the FNL breaking their agreements. We again see the allegations of torture and rough treatment. Burundi needs our help. It also needs self-restraint if it is never again to slip down that slope of intolerance and inhumanity.</p>

We call on both sides to respect the ceasefire of 7 September last year and particularly demand that the leader of the FNL, Agathon Rwasa, should fully engage in the peace process. We ask the Commission to provide resources to facilitate the reintegration of FNL troops into society, to help provide assistance to the refugees and in particular to demobilise child soldiers that we find in this country.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the heightened tension in Burundi, the civil war between ethnic groups and the violence there should immediately be stopped. Hundreds killed and injured is the price paid by unarmed civilians for this conflict. It is essential that the cease-fire be respected, it is essential that peacekeepers be involved. The financial support that the European Union is to give to Burundi must be carefully monitored and directed primarily for humanitarian purposes, particularly for healthcare, security and education for children.</p>

    <intervention id="4-246" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen: firstly, the European Union called for the resumption of dialogue between the parties as the sole means of making progress towards peace and reconciliation, which is a fundamental expectation of the Burundian people. The European Commission is therefore delighted that, on 16 May 2008, a delegation from the Palipehutu-FNL – that is, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People-National Liberation Forces – returned to Bujumbura, and I hope that it will be possible for both sides to resume active talks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I prefer to leave to one side the reply that I had prepared, for I have listened to a number of comments, and I feel that it is my duty to state a few facts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say to you – to be brief and to avoid repeating the excellent speeches that I have heard, especially those made by Mr Hutchinson, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Bowis – first of all, that the situation in Burundi today has nothing to do with ethnic problems and to suggest that it is an ethnic crisis is to look at it from a different and extremely dangerous perspective. Therefore, I am inclined to share Mr Hutchinson’s view, although I do regret somewhat that this debate is taking place here and now. It comes at rather an inopportune moment, for I feel that we must now give political dialogue a chance. Speaking as you have done, Mr Meijer, of an ethnic cause, is extremely dangerous guesswork.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Mr Hutchinson pinpointed the following fact: the international community, caught up as we are, and this applies to the World Bank – I have spoken on the subject with Bob Zoellick – and to the Commission, caught up in our procedures that prevent us, when a country is plunged into formal democracy, from releasing funds to show that there is a dividend to peace; this is one of the reasons why Burundi is finding it difficult to get moving again, as is the case, for example, in Liberia, as is the case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as is the case in any country that is categorised as a post-conflict country. We are caught up in our procedures, we have no flexibility and so we cannot offer a rapid response to these countries’ reconstruction needs, for this is where the real problem lies for Burundi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall naturally refrain from commenting on the speech which called for the deployment of European military forces – I am not saying that this is a separate issue – but it is clearly an issue that is somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. We continue actively to support Burundi, both politically and financially, in its peace-building and socio-economic recovery efforts. I should like to point out that our cooperation commitments for the period 2008-2013 currently amount to EUR 188 million, and it has been suggested that this funding might be further increased during the mid-term review. In this connection, I must tell you that the rule is that it will be possible to increase this level of funding only if Burundi has properly taken up all the funds allocated under the initial aid package. This is the rule, and I hope that the country will be in a position to benefit from this mid-term review.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The strategy adopted for this new period involves an increase in our budgetary support and identifies two areas on which attention should be focused: firstly, rehabilitation and rural development, which is clearly crucial for ensuring the survival of the populace; and, secondly, the healthcare sector. Our efforts to assist this country in its socio-economic recovery seek to demonstrate to the Burundian people what they can expect from the peace dividends as a stimulus to improve their situation. Burundi has been selected as a pilot country with a view to implementing the Council conclusions of November 2007, this has been mentioned, and I am delighted that is has been so selected. We have also agreed, together with the United Nations World Food Programme, to implement a pilot operation in Burundi, particularly in the area of education and the provision of canteens for schoolchildren, for it is clear that when children are provided with free meals, they will naturally want to go back to school. We shall also carry out a pilot case study that will include Burundi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I shall be visiting Burundi in the near future, as the Commission is very closely involved in all these mediation efforts. I should like to add that, when I was Foreign Minister, I participated directly in the Arusha negotiations with President Mandela, so it is a subject that I know rather well, and I can tell you, Mr Meijer, that the Burundian Constitution, the Burundian legislative system and the Burundian Parliament – the National Assembly and Senate – provide all the institutional solutions that are needed to bring the ethnic problem firmly under control. Therefore, it is not an ethnic issue, it is an issue of unease within the one ethnic group, rather than with the other group, and it is clearly a different problem from the one concerning the FNL. The FNL must now come to the negotiating table, turn itself into a genuine political party and participate in the country’s recovery and reconstruction.</p>
