      <p sl="unknown">I have several things to say as we begin. There are five brief points.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thursday, 27 January, will mark the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. Every year on this day, we honour the memory of the more than 1 million people who were murdered there. This gives us the strength to work together to build a peaceful future for a united Europe, a Europe which will not experience such nightmares again.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Secondly, on 13 January, the people of Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of ‘Bloody Sunday’, when the Soviet army tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of the independent Lithuania. Lithuanians defended their liberty, and today enjoy equal rights as members of the Euro-Atlantic community. In remembering this anniversary, an anniversary which is important for Europe, we express solidarity, today, with the people of Belarus, who are also our neighbours, and who are still waiting for freedom and democracy to come to their country.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thirdly, on 23 December 2010, the European Union ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Convention, together with the European Commission’s disability strategy, will enable equal civil, political and economic rights to be guaranteed by 2020 to the nearly 80 million citizens of the Union who are affected by some kind of disability.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Fourthly, I would also like to reiterate that we are seriously concerned by the disappearance of the Chinese lawyer, Gao Zhisheng. According to the latest reports, he is being mistreated and subjected to torture. The European Parliament has already taken up Mr Zhisheng’s case several times. Today, I would like to call upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the place where he is being detained and give details of his state of health.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Finally, since our last meeting before Christmas, the Belgian Presidency has ended, and the leadership of the European Union Council has been assumed by Hungary. We are going to talk about both presidencies during this part-session of Parliament. Since our last meeting, important political events have also taken place. I am thinking of the election in Belarus and the recent clashes in Tunisia. Both of these are on the order of business of our plenary part-session. I would also like to remind everyone that several serious natural disasters struck in the last weeks of the Christmas period. We sympathise with the victims’ families, and we would like to express our condolences to them and to the governments of the countries affected.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to refer to Rule 173 on compliance with the Rules of Procedure, in order to point out that Rule 116 is being infringed, because this is the third consecutive plenary part-session of the European Parliament which has not included Question Time with the Council in the order of business, as provided for in Rule 116. Please could you explain why that is and what the reason is and ensure, in future, that you defend the right of the European Parliament and of its members to exercise parliamentary control over the Council.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">We will make a decision about this very soon. It concerns the Treaty of Lisbon and the new relations between the European Parliament and the Council. We now have a bicameral parliament in the European Union. The European Parliament and the Council legislate on equal terms. Relations in the Union have changed, but I would propose that we do not continue this discussion, because this matter will be clarified in the near future. Thank you, Mr Chountis, for calling attention to this. It will be clarified very soon.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what I find questionable is the fact that, with a view to possible future changes, a parliamentary right – namely question time – is being withdrawn without any basis whatsoever. As you said yourself, the decision has not yet been taken. That being the case, we should continue with question time until a decision has been taken, rather than pre-emptively acquiescing to a decision that has not yet been made. I will tell you quite honestly that I think it is wrong because, in matters relating to foreign policy and enlargement policy, the Council is not a second Chamber but a body that, clearly, we must subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Monday</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the debate on the situation in Tunisia be wound up by the adoption of a resolution, which is something we had not been planning. So there is a proposal to adopt a resolution on the matter. I understand Mr Cohn-Bendit wants to say something about this request.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you are aware that the events in Tunisia have got out of hand, and also we can be pleased that Mr Ben Ali has left the country. The situation in these next few weeks will therefore be very tense in Tunisia. I think that Parliament needs to draw up a short resolution to ask some very specific things of the Council and the Commission. You are aware that elections may be held six to eight weeks from now, so we do not have the time to wait until February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union must act, we must act now, and our action must be based on a resolution that we should vote on on Thursday at noon. I understand that, in view of the situation, this House will be very enthusiastic about finally being able to approve a resolution on Tunisia.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Concerning debates held pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has made a request for the debate on ‘Brazil: extradition of Cesare Battisti’ to be removed from the agenda. Mr Tavares would like to move this request. Mr Tavares, you have the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-025-000" speaker_id="96821" name="Rui Tavares" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, some colleagues took the initiative of putting an urgency resolution on the agenda on Brazil’s refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti to Italy. I understand their motives, but as I shall demonstrate, this is not, at present, a human rights case. It is not an urgent case and it is not even a ‘breach of the Rule of Law’ case. Furthermore, it comes at a terrible moment when Brazil is facing the worst natural disaster in its history.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cesare Battisti is in prison. He is awaiting the decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court and the Supreme Court is currently not in session during the southern hemisphere’s summer holiday. There is no reason to believe that there will not be an independent decision. I expressed my solidarity with the families of the victims in this case, and rest assured I have no sympathy with political violence either from the right or the left, but we should use the urgencies to debate Southern Sudan, the case of Buchtar Tabuni in Indonesia, or the Palestinian man shot dead in his bed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the Parliament going to allocate to President Dilma Rousseff, just after her groundbreaking election and for no sound formal reason, the kind of debate that we usually reserve for people like Mugabe? I would ask you to remove Brazil from the urgencies on the agenda.</p>

Hundreds of people lost their lives and we should like to make our sympathy felt.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, on behalf of the proposers and, I hope, all of Parliament, I reiterate our firm intention to debate this issue, because the request for justice has still not been heard, and because the Cesare Battisti issue needs to be further deliberated upon by the European Parliament, which must make its voice heard in the international arena.</p>

    <intervention id="1-031-000" speaker_id="28269" name="Jerzy Buzek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">President. – Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great anxiety, but also with great hope, that we have been watching the events which have unfolded in recent weeks in Tunisia. Peaceful demonstrations in defence of legitimate demands turned into bloody clashes – which we deplore – when the Tunisian authorities turned against their own citizens. Today, we pay tribute to the victims of these events. We extend our profound sympathy to all those who have lost family or friends. In particular, we remember the first victim of the clashes – a young man named Mohamed Bouazizi. His tragic gesture has forever become a symbol of Tunisian society’s wave of democratic feeling. Let us observe a minute’s silence in memory of our Tunisian friends. Please stand.</p>
      <a text="(The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)"/>
      <p sl="en">Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ continues. In many respects, this is a truly historical time. I would like to express profound respect for the courage and determination of the citizens of Tunisia. It is they who are the source of the changes. It is, however, only the beginning of a long road. As Europeans, we share the aspirations of Tunisians and want to go with them on the road to achieving these aspirations in full. Europeans are particularly sensitive to social justice, equal opportunities, free speech, democracy, genuine pluralism and the ability to shape one’s own political future. This is why we do not remain indifferent, today. In addition, we call for the changes to be peaceful in character. They must serve justice and the rule of law. Furthermore, we have some fundamental demands. Firstly, the release of all those who have been arbitrarily arrested. Secondly, the conduct of independent investigations into serious charges of corruption, and also into cases of death and the abuse of force. Thirdly, transparent and truly democratic presidential and parliamentary elections, monitored by local and foreign observers and, fourthly, we support the efforts to create a government of national unity which would represent all Tunisians.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union and Tunisia have been linked by a partnership for many years – they are our neighbours from across the Mediterranean Sea. This partnership must, above all, be in the interests of our citizens – Tunisians and Europeans. Our partnership, if it is to be credible and significant, must support the Tunisians on their road to profound change. We must help Tunisia achieve success. Ladies and gentlemen, let us support the Tunisians.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-032-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent popular uprising in Tunisia is unprecedented in the modern history of the country. On 17 December 2010, a young university graduate set himself on fire out of sheer desperation after police seized the fruit and vegetables that he was selling for a living. Less than a month later, nationwide protests have brought about the definitive departure of President Ben Ali.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has condemned the violence of the repression during the last days of the regime. As I speak, the security situation remains precarious. Looting and violence are still being reported. Tunisia remains in a very delicate phase, although the first news about the formation of a national unity government is just coming in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite some uncertainty, the message of the Tunisian people is loud and clear: Tunisia wants to be a stable democracy that fully respects fundamental rights and freedoms. It wants free and fair, inclusive elections. The people want to write a new page in their history and we want to support them in that endeavour. Respect for the Constitution and the steps being taken, as we speak, to bring together a national solidarity government, are moves in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, this is only a start. The European Union has never ceased to remind Tunisia of its international obligations in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ever since the start of my term of office – since my hearing before this House in fact – I have repeated that enhanced status clearly means enhanced commitments in all areas of our relationship, including fundamental freedoms and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have stressed in all meetings with the Tunisian authorities, on behalf of the European Commission, that they had to deliver on their democratic and human rights commitments. At the very first session of negotiations on the action plan for statut avancé, I insisted personally, in an unprecedented and extremely clear way, that any use of the new Article 61a of the Penal Code would be seen by us as incompatible with statut avancé and with our shared values.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, by the way, if there were still sceptics on both sides who thought that these values were shared only in theory, they should listen again and again to the voice of the Tunisian street over the last days and weeks. What was this if not a solemn demand for democracy and for more economic justice?</p>
      <p sl="en">As Catherine Ashton and I stated this morning, the European Union stands ready to support a truly inclusive electoral process with appropriate guarantees. We hope its modalities can be announced as soon as possible, once the government of national unity has been shaped and starts its work. We are ready to provide immediate assistance in preparing and organising the electoral process, as well as lasting support for a genuine democratic transition.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also working on a broader package to assist – as soon as the situation stabilises – with, inter alia, economic development, close attention to the social problems faced by Tunisia’s youth, and consolidating the rule of law and the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will, of course, continue consulting closely with this House and with the Member States on this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Neighbourhood Policy is based on essential values shared by the European Union and its partners: democracy, human rights and an open market economy, with a view to building together a shared area of democracy, stability and prosperity. The Commission has always stressed that these values were an essential component of our neighbourhood policy, towards both our southern and our eastern neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">With its strong middle class, high level of education, closeness to Europe and overall moderation, Tunisia is well placed to take the leap towards democracy that people have now asked for with such force and courage, and I think everyone should agree that the European Union also has a strong interest in a democratic, prosperous and stable Tunisia. We have a long-standing and robust relationship with Tunisia and close links between our peoples and our business communities. It is my ambition, and that of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, that we should now strengthen our bilateral relations on the basis of new commitments by our partners on governance, respect for the rule of law and for fundamental freedoms, and economic and social reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will do our utmost to help the Tunisian people to turn their aspirations into reality.</p>

    <intervention id="1-033-000" speaker_id="2002" name="José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues. Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no. Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue. This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed.</p>
      <p sl="es">I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission. It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.</p>

    <intervention id="1-034-000" speaker_id="28365" name="Pier Antonio Panzeri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government.</p>
      <p sl="it">Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing. What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="it">In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona. This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved. In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby. The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade. The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation. They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure. European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past. This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner. We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement. On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to change tack – change gear – and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean. All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries. Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe’s actions.</p>

    <intervention id="1-035-000" speaker_id="96945" name="Marietje Schaake" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Tunisian people for their bravery, courage and persistence in speaking up for opportunities and freedom, and I hope all can refrain from using violence and that there will be free and fair elections soon.</p>
      <p sl="de">Citizens spoke out against an oppressive regime which has used bullets and killed its youth. Only weak governments go to such lengths to preserve their artificially obtained corrupt power and wealth. Regimes derive their legitimacy from providing for the wellbeing of their citizens, not from closing universities and access to information and free communications.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to access to information, the Tunisian opposition used the Internet, and the Internet is becoming more and more important for peaceful opposition across the world. I learned about the uprising by the citizens’ movement in Tunisia through the Internet and eyewitness accounts that were posted there, but it took about a month of the struggle before mainstream media and political leaders woke up to the realities of the street.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the same week – last week – the French Minister for Foreign Affairs offered help to the Tunisian Government in the form of riot police and assistance in policing. What is the Commission’s reaction to that offer, and where was the help for citizens in support of their rights?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The confrontation between the Tunisian Government and its people took place on the virtual highways of the Internet as much as on the streets. The Tunisian Government was known for being among the most advanced in the use of filtering and censoring software, and over the past month, it spared no efforts to repress people through these technologies. Repressive regimes across the world continue to use technologies to silence free speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today is Martin Luther King Day and it was Martin Luther King who said that a time comes when silence becomes betrayal. Commissioner Füle, that time has arrived. The United States has lost significantly in terms of credibility in its fight for leadership in Internet freedom.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU has a struggle ahead, about which we will speak tonight in relation to the upcoming Hungarian laws. But the young, freedom-loving generation across the world is looking to the symbolic example that Tunisia has given and is looking to the EU for support, and there is no reason why we should not lead in defending people’s freedoms, including on the Internet.</p>

    <intervention id="1-036-000" speaker_id="1934" name="Daniel Cohn-Bendit" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I admit that I would have liked this Parliament to measure up to the pride of the Tunisians who managed to defeat the dictator Ben Ali.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the dictator has fallen, but the dictatorship, the structure of the dictatorship, still exists in Tunisia. Today, we need to be very careful. European governments and the majority of this Parliament have, for years, supported the structure of the dictatorship, and the Tunisian dictator. Just last week, most groups rejected a debate on Tunisia and refused to condemn Ben Ali.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The French Foreign Minister’s actions are just the latest example of the West’s complicity. Why is this? Because of fear; because people were afraid of Islamism. We are right to fear Islamist dictatorship, but what do these young people, these Tunisians who were absolutely not Islamists, who were fighting for freedom, have to do with that? Mr Bouazizi, who immolated himself, is the Jan Palach of Tunisia, and when Jan Palach immolated himself, this whole Parliament was behind him. We are not even able to stand behind Mr Bouazizi – that is the truth about this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now the Commission needs to act. It simply needs to say one thing; it needs to say to the Tunisians that it will not be possible for a democratic election in a country which has just emerged from dictatorship to take place within two months. No democratic basis exists in the country. There is no freedom of expression, and the media, radio and television are not free. A state printing office is all that exists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is for this reason that I ask the Commission to take the money from the association agreement and to use it to support freedom of expression in Tunisia and not to support Tunisian government organisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, the transitional government is not a government of national unity. Why? Because the majority of those who fought or those who are in exile have not yet returned, and are not recognised. Time is therefore needed so that democratic forces – not the forces ‘recognised’ by Ben Ali, but truly democratic forces – can develop.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must demonstrate that, for us, what is happening in Tunisia is the key to understanding and hope for all Arab countries. Democracy and Islam can go together, and if we are able to support the fledgling Tunisian democracy, we will see that in Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and everywhere, the people and peoples will rise against their dictators.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a responsibility, all of us here, because in the end, Tunisians – who form part of the Arab world – are showing us that the hope of freedom that we saw in 1989 in the Eastern Bloc is now being born in a country such as Tunisia. Tomorrow, we will see this in Algeria, and the day after in Egypt and Jordan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For that reason, therefore, it is unthinkable that this Parliament could remain seated and say: ‘Yes, perhaps; we do not know’. We did not know in 1989 how Poland would turn out. We did not know how Russia would turn out with Gorbachev. If we ask for an assurance every time people demand freedom – that is, if we ask them to tell us that the situation will definitely progress in a particular direction – we will never support freedom, and that is why I ask the Commission to move, give something, show the Tunisians that the realpolitik now is the policy of supporting democracy and no longer the policy of supporting the dictatorship structure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the upheaval in Tunisia is undoubtedly a reflection of people’s frustration at the country’s political stagnation and its relative economic stagnation. The flagrant corruption and wealth of the ruling family elite contrasted sharply with the high levels of poverty and unemployment among ordinary people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Former President Ben Ali paid the supreme price for failing to meet the expectations and aspirations of his people, but I do not agree with some assessments, particularly in the Green Group, that his government was one of the most repressive in the Arab world. Tunisia has been an example, in some ways, of a modern, secular and progressive Arab country. For example, polygamy and veils were banned and foreign direct investment and tourism were encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tunisia has managed to resist the efforts of violent Jihadis to undermine the integrity of its secular society. It is therefore essential that Tunisia’s political leaders – the new leaders that will now emerge – protect that legacy, because Salafist extremists will undoubtedly try to take advantage of the chaos and turmoil that will advance their dangerous agenda, which obviously also threatens European political objectives, including foreign policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tunisia’s new political leadership also needs to understand that poor governance and gross inequality offer a fertile breeding ground for violent radicalism. I am encouraged that the interim leadership has promised substantial reforms because embarking on such a path will greatly strengthen Tunisia’s relationship with the European Union. In the meantime, my group calls for maximum restraint by the security forces and for the arrest and trial of the ancien regime’s presidential guard leadership responsible for the shooting, in the last few days, of innocent bystanders, in a futile attempt to destabilise the country. I congratulate the army on its professionalism in protecting the Republic’s institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the EU must give the new Tunisian government of unity every assistance and also afford every assistance to EU citizens, including British citizens, who are stranded, having been in Tunisia on a holiday.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some pride and much emotion that I speak in this House today on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reason is that very few of us in this House have denounced the abuses of the Tunisian regime and what people had to go through who dared, against all the odds, to criticise it and denounce its practices, and particularly the torture of human rights defenders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It took the self-immolation of a young man of 26 to make the Tunisian people rise up and no longer be afraid, because they felt quite alone. The hope of freedom has been born there. It took more than 50 deaths before the European Union dared to make a timid statement calling for restraint in the use of force, but without calling into question the sacrosanct EU-Tunisia partnership and without condemning the violence, Mr Füle, until Saturday. The least that we can say is that the Tunisian regime has hardly heard you since your appointment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These words about ‘restraint in the use of force’ stuck in my throat. The European Parliament has been mute apart from a timid statement by the Maghreb delegation. It was only on Saturday that you spoke out on this, Mr President, and today a majority in the European Parliament rejected a written resolution. However, the European authorities manage to be more vocal towards other regimes. As a French person, I know what the responsibilities of the French Government are, and I will not revisit the proposals of our Foreign Minister. Obviously, for some people, the colonial era is not yet over, but let us hope that all of this is consigned to the past.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks to the courage of the Tunisian people, the Tunisian miracle, so dear to some people here, has collapsed within a few days and has shown its true face. Today, the European Union has a great responsibility to stand by the Tunisian people in their democratic transition, but without interfering in it. The European Union must monitor the electoral process and make sure that an independent investigating committee sheds full light on what has happened – on the violence and the corruption. The Tunisian people must no longer be pillaged. The assets of the Ben Ali and Trabelsi families must not only be monitored; they must be frozen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has failed. There is a long way to go before the Tunisians regain confidence. Things are still difficult today, it is true, and what is happening in the country may provide a good example for the Maghreb region. We know that identical uprisings may take place in all those countries in which the West still puts its own interests above those of the people concerned. Men have already immolated themselves in Algeria, Egypt and Mauritania. It is time to move from words to action where democracy and human rights are concerned. It is time for the European Union to restructure its partnerships with the countries of the South and to finally construct them on the basis of democratic requirements, respect for human rights and equality, or else it will effectively pave the way for fundamentalists.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you made some remarks at the beginning of the debate about free and fair elections and good representative government and you asked us to support the people of Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="en">No democrat could disagree. People will tolerate a lot from incompetent, corrupt governments, but push them too far and they will rebel. It is a doctrine of internal security services that any population is only three days away from riots and civil unrest when the food supplies run out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are there any parallels to be drawn between what is happening in Tunisia and the European Union? The EU gives undemocratic and incompetent government. It has a political class that is increasingly detached from the wishes of its people. There is high youth unemployment in many countries in Europe as a direct result of EU policies. There are already riots and civil unrest in Greece due to its purely ideological commitment to the European single currency. Countries like Spain, Portugal and Ireland may soon follow Greece as their economies become untenable in the straitjacket of the euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Do not think that it cannot happen in European countries. When governments become the enemies of their own people, then the people will eventually rebel.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Stihler, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC [10753/3/2010 – C7-0267/2010 – 2008/0098(COD)] (A7-0343/2010).</p>

    <intervention id="1-043-000" speaker_id="4545" name="Catherine Stihler" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a good way to start the New Year with this debate and tomorrow’s vote on the deal concluded under the Belgian Presidency on this important report on construction products.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to start by thanking all colleagues who made this possible for their hard work, their thoughtfulness and commitment to making this proposal a reality. I would also like to put on record my thanks to the IMCO Secretariat and to the Belgian Presidency, in particular, to Mr Vertessen and Mr Haerynck for all their dedicated work.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said in my report quoting the poet Robert Frost - ‘Good fences make good neighbours’ (with an implied question mark). It is important that we maintain the momentum to complete the internal market and break down barriers to trade. As Mario Monti in his report on the Single Market acknowledges, ‘Europe is still in a phase of ‘market construction’ that requires breaking down barriers to cross border activity, cutting dead wood of national administrative and technical barriers and overcoming corporate resistance’.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this proposal we have attempted to make the single market work more effectively, we have attempted to have clearer and more transparent systems in place so that products placed on the market are of the highest standards and that the construction industry has a fairer market place to trade within.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, the construction industry is facing the economic challenges caused by the global financial meltdown of 2008 and exacerbated by the slow economic recovery we face across the EU. We should never forget what an important sector the construction industry is – 12 million EU citizens are directly employed in the sector and 26 million EU citizens are dependent on it – that is 38 million people reliant on the sector. For economic growth, construction is essential for jobs and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also one of the most dangerous sectors to work within. Taking Germany, whose safety record is second to none, one construction worker in 5 000 will suffer a fatal accident during their lifetime. The health and safety of those who work at the coalface of construction should always be remembered and it is important to have acknowledgement of this in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was with this in mind that we successfully managed on both sides to come to some agreement on the issue of labelling hazardous substances, so that the report was in line with REACH but also helps those who work with products which, in the past, have led to chronic conditions and death – conditions such as asbestos-related mesotheliomia and, to an extent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by working conditions and by inhaling dust.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proper labelling of hazardous substances can help those with these lung conditions and illustrates how interlinked our work here is. I am proud of the fact that this report was conducted and concluded under the European Year of the Lung. Lung health is so often neglected and I was delighted that in this Parliament, we recognised its importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to briefly comment on SMEs. In Parliament, we are urged to ‘think small first’ and this should carry throughout our work. This is why we have managed to create a second stream for smaller corporations to place their products on the internal market and the system should make it cheaper and more practical for SMEs to reach a larger market place which can only increase their trading potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the separate issue over transparency concerning who serves on technical bodies and how they work, I think that we have moved the bodies which approve products further than was originally foreseen. The transparency over processes and the approval of products can only help break down the walls and barriers which exist in the European Union today. This should help companies in the EU and, in particular, the special conditions set for micro-enterprises are also helpful in these tough economic conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Union, we should always strive for better regulation. Along with my shadow rapporteurs, I have modified the sections of the report which are no longer relevant or which were so unclear that no one was able to follow them or ensure their application. For an industry such as the construction sector, it is imperative that the rules are clear and I look forward to seeing the difference these particular changes will make.</p>
      <p sl="en">The scale is huge and the challenges many, but today, these new rules which will come into force through Member States in the next 24 months will help the construction sector as we attempt to create economic growth and, through this, jobs.</p>

    <intervention id="1-044-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the President, who is doing us the honour of chairing a debate on an issue that is so very important for industrial policy and the internal market. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who worked exhaustively on this proposal and, thanks to her commitment, has enabled us to reach an agreement at second reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also wish to express my sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Harbour. Your collective efforts were crucial in reaching a turning point in negotiations between the European institutions on this extremely technical dossier.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission welcomes the second-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council since, irrespective of its technical nature, this is a dossier of great importance. The adoption of the regulation on construction products represents an inestimably significant step forward for the entire European construction sector. Construction products account for 3% of gross domestic product in Europe and, in terms of employment, activities related to the construction sector account for 6.5% of Europe’s GDP and 7.5% of employment. Altogether, this means that the construction sector accounts for 10% of the European economy, as the rapporteur noted in her speech.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, the adoption of the regulation on construction products constitutes an important step forward in terms of simplifying and improving the legislation, whilst, at the same time, consolidating the internal market for construction products. This was also the first practical application of the principles enshrined in the Small Business Act. In effect, EU law will finally provide European enterprises – and particularly micro-enterprises – with tools that help them rather than the exact opposite, that is to say, forms to fill out, bureaucratic procedures and extra obligations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I cannot but be satisfied by this outcome, particularly with regard to the solutions provided to three issues that had been thought, in the past, to be more complicated. Firstly, with regard to the issue of hazardous substances, the Commission will draft a report on this important issue, keeping Parliament informed and, if necessary, presenting any further legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, there is the special treatment reserved for micro-enterprises, which have always been considered essential in order to safeguard the principles of the Small Business Act. The outcome achieved satisfies this criterion as it retains the possibility for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, various parts of the text recognise the need to reduce the administrative and testing obligations on enterprises, partly by introducing simplified procedures for CE marking, but also by keeping the use of European Technical Assessments optional.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, as indicated by the Statement by the European Commission annexed to the Council’s position at first reading, we will need to check that the chosen solutions are truly the best to deal with existing needs. In particular, we will have to avoid subjecting enterprises – and particularly micro-enterprises – to unjustified or, in any case, unnecessary administrative obligations. We intend to monitor this aspect carefully and will add our conclusions to the report to the European Parliament and the Council, which is to be drawn up five years after the entry into force of this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should also like to clarify that the Commission intends to work closely with the European Parliament and, naturally, with the Council, with regard to the implementation of this regulation. To this end, I have asked my services – whom I thank for the contribution they always make to the legislative work of the Commission – to draw up a road map for implementation, which I intend to send to you as soon as possible. This looks, in particular, at the so-called comitology aspects. Parliament is a key partner of the Commission and I can assure you that I intend to continue to work closely with you, including with regard to the next phase in the adoption process. Besides, 14 years in this Chamber were not spent in vain.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, the Commission felt it necessary to present a statement regarding the departure from the common agreement between the institutions, relating to the deadline to submit an objection to delegated acts. The Commission is keen to stress that the principle laid down in the draft common agreement provides for a two-month period to submit objections, which may be extended by a further two months.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this case, the Commission holds the view that there are no special circumstances that can justify the violation of this principle. The Commission regrets the fact that the principle agreed in the draft common agreement has not been respected and emphasises in its statement that what has happened in the construction products case cannot set a precedent.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to thank Parliament – including through the President, whom I thank again for having participated in this debate – for the interest with which it examined this simplification proposal. To conclude, I should like to highlight the advantages that we can expect from this new regulation, as well as those created for the producers and users of construction products, as well as national administrations.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also confirm the Commission’s willingness to adhere to the obligations contained in the text of the regulation, in particular, to draw up the reports that have been requested.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thank you once again Mr President, and thank you honourable Members for the commitment and cooperation you have shown.</p>

    <intervention id="1-045-000" speaker_id="28223" name="Andreas Schwab" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all those who played an active part in bringing this regulation to second reading. This regulation – as its title suggests – represents an improvement on the existing directive. In the past, of course, building regulations were, to some extent, a core domain of national autonomy. The fact that we have succeeded here in bringing the European internal market to the fore with a regulation is very positive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, the regulation contains a number of important relaxations which will facilitate their economic activity and their dealings in Europe’s internal market. Finally, consumers will, of course, also benefit from this regulation because it will considerably improve the safety and reliability of construction products.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can also speak for our shadow rapporteur, Professor Mayer, who, on account of some constituency-related business, has, unfortunately, had to remain in his constituency today. He asked me to mention that ultimately, at second reading, this regulation represents a compromise, a good compromise in his view, but there are nevertheless still a few issues that will need further work. I am very grateful to Mr Tajani for pointing out that Parliament will also be involved in the follow-up work that remains to be done. As shadow rapporteur, Professor Mayer feels it is not enough simply to regulate the behaviour of manufacturers of construction products and the sale of their products; this regulation must be supplemented by legislation that also establishes the principles and practical rules for the use and installation of construction products. In this regard, Professor Mayer believes that the Commission should consider giving the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) a mandate to produce a standardised European regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">He would also like to point out that the Commission is required to monitor whether the new Construction Products Regulation leads to adequate harmonisation in all areas and does not result in further safety problems and unfair competition. However, after listening to what Commissioner Tajani has had to say, I am sure that we will achieve this together.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report – a report in which high political standards also had to be respected. It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products. It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises. Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules. However, that does not mean – and this is where the Commission’s proposal was improved upon – that a lower level of safety should be permitted. The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront. This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again. Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks. After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials. It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area. This level of protection will also need to be considered later – and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani – in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Stihler and all the shadow rapporteurs. I believe we have achieved a good compromise in this second reading, even if – as is always the case with compromises, of course – not all sides are satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like specifically to pick up on Professor Meyer’s comments, as communicated by Mr Schwab. I believe that we still have work to do with regard to labelling. We now have good harmonisation of construction products, by which I mean the manufacture of construction products. However, the area where we still have work to do is that of the installation and use of construction products. One option is for the Commission to continue its work in this regard in the area of the Eurocodes and for there then also to be a mandate for this in the area of the Eurocodes in order for progress to be made.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other option is for us to harmonise the field of application and use so that we do not fall back to the national level in this regard and only have European harmonisation in relation to the products themselves and not in relation to their use. We need to do more work in this regard, and the Commission will also receive our full support if further measures are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention one further point that was important in the debate regarding whether or not we should vote in favour. Unfortunately, the Belgian Presidency made an error during the negotiations. Following the first reading, it introduced new areas in the second reading – Articles 8(3) and 8(6) – without Parliament’s full consent. The Hungarian Presidency has now addressed this in a letter. However, I do not believe that the Hungarian Presidency has truly understood the conflict. I would like to point out once again that, in future, if it introduces new items in the second reading, I expect the Council to actually approach Parliament and try to reach a good compromise with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, in view of the result, we do not believe that it would make sense to reject this compromise on account of a procedural error of this kind. We will vote in favour of this compromise because we believe that it is an important step towards further harmonisation of the sector, a sector of major economic importance. The compromise therefore receives our support at this second reading.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Stihler for her hard work. It has been a very long road.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe today, the construction sector directly employs 12 million EU citizens. In addition, approximately 92% of the manufacturers of construction materials are small and medium-sized enterprises – this amounts to over 65 000 individual businesses. Clearly, the construction sector is vital for the European economy, and we have a responsibility to the industry to help support it, especially after the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many aspects of this report which produced something of a stalemate between many of us, such as the nature of EU legislation. It is not perfect, it is a compromise. Key issues included the declaration of performance or CE marking, where a successful agreement was made to ensure micro-enterprises do not face the same burdens as larger companies. On tackling and identifying hazardous substances in construction products, we managed to broker a compromise ensuring no conflict with existing REACH regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that this second-reading agreement will have real results and will encourage the free movement of construction products, improve standards across the EU, and promote the recycling of construction products in future whilst, most importantly, not increasing bureaucratic burdens on businesses or confusing consumers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the compromise reached in relation to some specific points that I feel are of vital importance to effectively achieve the objectives that we are proposing to reach under this legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am referring to the retention of the rules on simplified procedures, which are surely designed to lighten the burdens and reduce the costs incurred by enterprises, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Indeed, I think that in the context of a negative economic situation like the present, it is absolutely essential to recognise the importance of the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up one of the fundamental foundation blocks on which our economy is based.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, by introducing simplified procedural mechanisms and, in particular, by reducing the time it takes to place new products on the market, the new regulation definitely favours innovation. At the same time, it also protects consumers, allowing them to gain faster access to innovative products without foregoing the guarantees of quality and safety that have to be ensured by CE marking.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, in my view, the agreement reached represents an excellent compromise that will strike the right balance between the needs of producers and those of consumers, thereby guaranteeing the proper functioning of the market in a sector that is truly the driving force of our European economy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I must thank Mrs Stihler for the excellent work she has done. We have all been talking about a technical issue. Luckily, Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, has highlighted the fact that this is not just a technical issue; it is also a highly political and economic issue. We all know that construction is a basic pillar of the economy. We all know that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy, an economy that, within the framework of the European Union, is in an extremely difficult situation. Thus, Mrs Stihler’s report is also of great political importance and she has made an excellent job of it.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have managed to achieve a compromise, a good compromise for everyone. We have managed to strike a balance that will give us simple procedures, which can be applied without compromising the standard of small and medium-sized enterprises and, at the same time, the best possible result.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have managed to sort out the issue of hazardous substances. We all remember – and the older ones here remember very well – the issue of asbestos contamination of the Berlaymont building, which was closed for five or six years. Imagine what would happen to entire states in the European Union if we were unable to handle the question of hazardous substances.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, we still have to deal with the question of safety and transparency. Here, too, I think that Mrs Stihler has done an excellent job in her report and in the compromise achieved.</p>

We have a letter from the Hungarian Presidency on some of the detailed issues which will be published with the Minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to make two concluding remarks in endorsing this agreement. The first is to say to you, Commissioner, in thanking you for your work with us, that we need to work very closely with you on the implementation of this proposal. As you pointed out, there are important aspects of comitology here and my committee is absolutely behind the need to follow up these proposals very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I think that this is an absolutely crucial sector and we do need to keep it under review, as many colleagues have said, to make sure that there are, in effect, no market barriers put in place that are going to stop it contributing vitally to the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I am very satisfied with the text of the Construction Products Directive agreed between the rapporteurs and the very helpful Commissioners Tajani and Barnier for today’s second reading. This should simplify the market for construction products. It unifies enthusiastically, it simplifies documentation and it removes various unnecessary bureaucratic practices. The view that the construction of buildings constitutes the provision of building services and not the marketing of products, and that construction activity also includes the incorporation into a building of any non-serial manufactured components, has finally prevailed, which is something I welcome. Firms in the Czech Republic also applaud this small reform, because the old directive increased their costs without bringing improvements in quality. The IMCO committee, of which I am a member, has come together and adopted the text unanimously, including the simplifications for micro-enterprises. I trust that Parliament in its entirety will do the same tomorrow. It will be another sign that the legal environment in the EU is improving in a way that will support the unified market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation. First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures. We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too. In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible. However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise. This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products. However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe. This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the words of Mr Harbour when he stresses the importance of the text that we are debating and that will be adopted thanks to this agreement from Parliament. This is because it is a new piece of legislation that will give important guidance to the market but, at the same time, will establish good rules to allow small and medium-sized enterprises to expand, above all, in this final phase of the current crisis, during which we must do everything possible to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises can create new jobs and grow. This is the aim of the European Commission, which is backed up by the real commitment of the European Parliament, partly as a result of the implementation and development of the Small Business Act.</p>
      <p sl="it">Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from simplification, including a reduction in red tape. However, as Mrs Gebhardt said in her speech, these rules for the liberalisation and development of the market also provide real guidance on safety, which is of great importance for construction sector workers, but also consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this report is heading in the right direction. However, the Commission does not intend to stop with the adoption of the legislation that has resulted from the agreement and the compromise between the Council and Parliament. We want to keep working on this over the coming years, and I should also like to assure Mr Harbour – who stressed the need to move forward – of our commitment to produce a road map for implementation, which I will forward to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">During this debate, many of the honourable Members have spoken about harmonisation in the construction sector, particularly with regard to safety. I am fully mindful and aware of the problem and I am pleased to have drawn up the Eurocodes with the European Standards Organisation, since these are harmonised rules specifically relating to construction safety. As you know, the Commission is currently preparing a communication on standardisation, which will be submitted for the attention of Parliament and the Council within a few weeks. Therefore, Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that today and tomorrow, we are taking an important step forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">To reiterate, it is not only a matter of technical rules, though I should like to thank the rapporteur for her patience in dealing with the technical rules, which, in any case, represent a snapshot of a major political commitment. Behind the technical details there lurks an important economic choice favouring small and medium-sized enterprises, which can create new jobs over the coming years, as well as favouring half a billion European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think Commissioner Tajani’s comments about partnership working, the road map and the issue of Eurocodes, which Mrs Rühle and (I think) Mr Schwab also mentioned, are important and that we take forward the good cooperation that we have had. It is a compromise that we have reached and there are some things colleagues might have liked in this compromise that we did not manage to get in, but Parliament managed to secure 75% of the amendments that we thought were important within this text, and that is no mean feat.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is something that struck me throughout this debate. The construction sector is so vitally important to our economies for future growth, for jobs, that I would like to ask the President whether we can make sure there is an annual debate in this House on the construction sector, to take forward the cooperation that the Commissioner has offered to us and to make sure that we always place the importance on the construction sector that this House should do, given that 38 million people rely on the construction sector for their jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, thank you, Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, and I look forward to the weeks, months and years ahead, because the construction debate will continue in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I for one will certainly be following it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the content of her report. Construction products is one of the European economy’s sectors which is both vulnerable and important and which we need to harmonise. I use the term ‘vulnerable’ not only because of the way in which this sector has responded to the recession, but also, in particular, because of the number of workers and SMEs it has, 12 million and approximately 65 000 respectively. I strongly support the notion that we must acknowledge the need for a high level of health and safety at work where construction products are involved. I am also clearly referring not only to accidents at work, which occur fairly frequently, but also to hazardous substances used in work processes. I want to add one final point. The single market for construction products requires support appropriate to its size and specific nature, including for the vulnerable aspects which I mentioned at the start of my speech.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the dioxin animal feed incident and its impact on the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="1-061-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, as you are well aware, the New Year started with a serious incident of dioxin contamination of animal feed in Germany. The Commission services have been monitoring developments closely and in full cooperation with the competent German authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already started considering possible measures which will ensure that our high-level food and feed safety system will become even more efficient. But let me start with the facts of the incident first: the incident came to light when a compound feed manufacturer notified the German competent authorities on 22 December 2010 after having received the analytical result from a laboratory that a sample was found to be non-compliant with EU legislation after self-controlled tests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Between the middle of November and middle of December of last year, a biodiesel manufacturer delivered seven consignments of fatty acids intended for technical purposes to a feed fat manufacturer who also produces fats for technical use. This latter company was, at the same time, a registered feed fat manufacturer; apparently, blending of feed grade fat and technical fat took place. Four of these consignments delivered in the second half of November were later found to be contaminated with dioxins. The other three delivered to feed mills in the first half of December 2010 were not contaminated.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, until this was verified and for purely precautionary reasons, all consignments were regarded and treated as potentially contaminated. A total of almost 2 300 tonnes of potentially contaminated feed fat was delivered to 25 feed manufacturers in Germany. No deliveries of feed fat were made outside of Germany.</p>
      <p sl="en">Between 100 000 and 200 000 tonnes of feed containing 2% to 10% of the potentially contaminated fat were delivered to about 4 800 farms in Germany. As a strictly precautionary measure, all farms were blocked; their commercial activities suspended; there were laying hen, fattening poultry, goose, pig, dairy cattle, bovine and rabbit farms. Some deliveries of potentially contaminated feed for breeding hens were also made to France and Denmark.</p>
      <p sl="en">No food of animal origin from the blocked farms can be placed on the market until the farms are unblocked. This can only happen after it is ensured through analytical results and investigations that the farms are not contaminated at levels above those provided by the EU law. Currently, of these 4 800 farms that were originally blocked, 939 farms – mostly poultry and pig establishments – remain blocked. It appears that no contaminated food was traded or exported from Germany since the incident was notified, with a few exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the end, analytical results showed that the products were compliant with EU legislation. This is an example of the effectiveness of the EU’s traceability system and we will continue to be vigilant in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fortunate element of this incident is that the observed levels of dioxin in food where EU limits were exceeded have not been very high, which means that no immediate health risk for the consumer is expected as a result of the consumption, if any, of the contaminated products during a short period of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">What has the Commission done to help manage the incident? My services have been in constant contact with the German authorities and they immediately disseminated all information to Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. They have also been in touch with the competent authorities in third countries, providing a clear picture of the incident to our trade partners. Moreover, Commission officials met with stakeholders in the fats and oils industries to explore ways of further strengthening the monitoring of dioxin in feed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally contacted the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, on 6 January, and we exchanged views on what needs to be done to avoid similar contamination and incidents in the future. Today, I again contacted the German Minister, as I was concerned by the recent news from last weekend that a feed manufacturer did not provide a full list of farms which received potentially contaminated feed, and provided incorrect information as regards the use of contaminated feed fat in compound feed, resulting in an additional blocking of several hundred farms.</p>
      <p sl="en">This concerns a very serious infringement of EU food safety provisions. Let me say it clearly: the German authorities are fully engaged in dealing with this contamination and are doing their best to deal with it urgently and decisively.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am informed that they are making available additional capacity for testing so that this is done and finished in the shortest possible time. However, it is important that the wider implications for the approach towards the safety of animal feed at EU level are also urgently addressed. For this reason, a team from the Food and Veterinary Office will visit Germany next week to assist the German authorities and to inform our overall knowledge and understanding of how this contamination happened and how it can be avoided in the future. The German authorities are informed and have agreed to this visit. I know that we can count on the full cooperation of our German colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="en">This incident will also be discussed during the Agricultural Council which will take place in Brussels next Monday, 24 January. As I have already mentioned, we are reflecting on measures including legislative ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">The incident has highlighted the necessity to ensure the effectiveness of national control systems which underpin the confidence of all EU Member States and third countries in our food and feed safety measures. In order to address this issue, I am exploring the possibility of establishing a strict segregation of the production of fats and oils intended for feed and food purposes from the production of fats and oils for technical uses, and I am considering the possibility of legal requirements on reinforced controls on dioxins at different stages of the feed chains.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that these measures, when endorsed and adopted, will bring the necessary improvements to our already solid food and feed safety systems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany. It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity. We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like – in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers – but still we are not immune to such dangers.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it must also be a requirement – and the Member States are also responsible for this – that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially. Such people must not get off with a fine – prison sentences are called for here. They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures – that was also my impression in Germany. There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly. We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support. I, too, am in favour – and I am also speaking on behalf of my group – of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening. You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks. My perception of the press – at least in Germany – is somewhat different. It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety. We cannot allow this to happen. I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area. However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible. The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area. The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties. Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors. The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings. I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain – from trough to table. After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others. As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal. One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there. This is unacceptable. In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into. The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability. The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, we have experienced four incidents of this type in Europe within 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While we must be pleased that our rapid alert system has worked properly, it is completely unacceptable for this type of incident to have occurred. The health of European consumers must not be the adjustment variable in a system which prioritises cost reduction and which essentially indirectly encourages such incidents when the penalties are as weak as they are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Commissioner, we need to have the confidence of our fellow citizens, as you know better than anyone. What actions are you intending to take, then? You spoke just now – and I am pleased about this – of a requirement to segregate the production of industrial oils and oils intended for food. This must be an obligation, Commissioner, and not simply an option in the manufacturing process; that way, we will have much more certainty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, it is totally unfair that manufacturers can declare insolvency in this way. What actions can we take, Commissioner, to ensure that such acts do not go unpunished? Responsibility is still the best guardian of security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, what actions do you intend to take to improve the supervision established by the Member States? The alert was given nearly three weeks after these oils were delivered. Of course, that is hardly the Commission’s fault, but, quite simply, it is a problem for consumers in the meantime. Do you think that we can improve the situation in this regard, Commissioner?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the confidence of consumers has been badly shaken once again and consumers are, quite naturally, asking themselves what the national authorities are doing and what is the EU doing to put a stop to the work of these contaminators. In contrast to the Commissioner, I do not believe that it was an accident or mere chance. I believe that behind this, there is a system whereby particular companies earn millions from a blend of substances that do not actually belong in feed. They then evade liability and farmers and consumers pay the price.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this needs to be our starting point, and we of course also need to ask ourselves whether the checks are being made in the wrong place? In Germany, there are a handful of companies in the feed sector that work with fat. Why do we not apply targeted checks there? Why do we rely on self checks and receive values rather randomly that then require state checks to be carried out ex post? In other words, we need a risk-based form of monitoring throughout Europe. Therefore, Commissioner, my question to you is: what is the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) doing in this regard? Is this a German case or are there other cases in Europe that are perhaps yet to be discovered?</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we are in agreement that we need a positive list of what feed is actually permitted to contain. We need strict authorisation rules for the companies and we need a liability obligation and the separation of the commodity flows. However, I believe – and this needs to be reiterated here – that we also need a fundamental change of course in many policy areas, because, at the end of the day, feed for animals should come from our fields and not from industrial enterprises. Farmers need to know what they are feeding their animals, and consumers also need to know where the feed comes from. We need to ensure that this is the case. We can, and must, start the agricultural reform here, by turning this situation around again, because ultimately, the whole of agriculture suffers as a result of the damage caused here by a few criminals contaminating feed, and that is something that we must prevent as a matter of principle.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I sympathise totally with the position that many German farmers find themselves in at the present time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had this experience about two years ago in Northern Ireland when we went through a very similar exercise. The people who really suffered in this were the farmers who were not actually involved in any way at all. I think the word ‘criminal’ has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this. We have to ask why they do it, and whether they are doing it to make a lot of extra money, as Mr Häusling says. If they are, they should be prosecuted for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we should make it very clear that it is not those who are producing food that are responsible. It is the providers of the feed to those who are producing the food that are responsible. We must take action against these people to make sure that it does not happen and to restore consumer confidence. I can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment. As someone said, this has happened before and it should not be allowed to happen again. Let us not simply go wholesale and bring in new legislation. Let us implement what we have.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating – these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany. Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone. Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food. Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany. Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible. State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers. The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff. Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed. The contamination would then have been detected in time. Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again. Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin – in other words, meat, milk and eggs. Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed. Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed. Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done. That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants.</p>
      <p sl="de">Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities. We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability. The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential. How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?</p>

    <intervention id="1-068-000" speaker_id="1927" name="Peter Liese" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, consumers and farmers must be better protected against irresponsible feed and feed fat adulterators. We must put a stop to the work of these adulterators throughout Europe. One fellow Member has just spoken solely about Germany, but we have unfortunately had dioxin and other similar scandals in the past in other Member States, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">First and foremost, it is a matter for the public prosecutor, because these are criminal acts. I hope that the public prosecutors in Germany and the organisations from other countries that may perhaps still be involved – there was also mention of the Netherlands being part of the chain – will work faster than the public prosecutors in Ireland. There, the people responsible for a scandal in 2008 have only now been prosecuted. We need to be faster in this regard in general.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask that we put this scandal – and it is a scandal – into the right perspective. The values were a maximum of four times too high. That is bad, and there are good reasons why we have a precautionary level that must not be exceeded. However, the precautionary level has been deliberately chosen so that we only reach the range in which long-term damage was seen in animal experiments at 100 times this limit. Thus, there is no acute risk; it is a matter of precaution.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of the scandal in Belgium in 1999, the values were 700 times higher than the current EU limit value. We have also reduced dioxin contamination in the environment to a tenth of what it was in 1990 through EU measures – for example, through chemicals legislation, improved standards in connection with waste incineration plants and so on. Nevertheless, we need measures that have to be taken in the foodstuffs chain throughout Europe. We need dioxin monitoring, we need segregation of the fats, in my opinion, we need an EU-wide purity requirement for feed, and we need better protection for farmers who are not able to prevent such carelessness and criminal scheming from occurring again and again in the feedstuffs chain.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I cannot stress the point enough that Europe has unquestionably far more rigorous quality standards for food products than anywhere else in the world. Our consumers, our export markets and our producers alike all demand that we make a huge effort and significant investment to maintain these standards.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the contamination that occurred recently in Germany had happened in many other parts of the world, the chances are that we would not even have heard of it. It did not, however. It happened right here in the European Union. What happened in Germany is unacceptable, and not only must it be fully investigated, but the perpetrators must also be held responsible for what appears to be a crime rather than an accident.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The origin of the contamination still remains unclear and I find that very alarming. There appears to be no clear definition of the liability of the German authorities for any failure in their supervisory responsibilities. It seems that the fact came to light due to a company communication and not through the controls implemented by the authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal. The people of Europe have been shown their reflection. How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food.</p>
      <p sl="de">For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength. Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods. However, we will all lose out in the end as a result. We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties – none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must finally tackle the causes of this problem. We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food. As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals – as in this case – on my own doorstep. Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food? I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this scandal gives me a real sense of déjà vu, because the course the crisis has taken is, indeed, almost identical to the one that occurred twelve years ago in Belgium. Far too many incidents over the past ten years have shown that there are quite a few players operating in the animal feed oils and fats industry who, out of unscrupulous greed and in a criminal way, are prepared to commit fraud, fraud that is detrimental to farmers’ income and consumer health. That is unacceptable. Hence, there is indeed a need for the existing legislation to undergo a stress test. I hope that the Agriculture Council will comment on this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, there is also a need for monitoring and surveillance. There is still a great deal of self-monitoring in the industry. National authorities need to carry out additional, more stringent checks on all forms of self-monitoring. This should be done in a proportionate way. Secondly, I think that the Irish Food and Veterinary Office should carry out more monitoring. We need more monitoring of those doing the monitoring. I have read that, in the past ten years, the FVO has undertaken only three missions. That is too few and we need to increase that number. Commissioner, are you going to instruct the FVO to carry out a number of missions regarding the dioxin problems?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, over the many years it has been in operation, the European Union has created an enormously complex structure of various rules and regulations, which ought to give the public the impression that the Union cares about the purity and quality of our food. In order to reinforce this message, it has employed many different specialists, inspectors, vets and officials, developing a complex institutional behemoth to guarantee European food quality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, today we see how well it is doing. Europe is awash with badly contaminated foods, and our bureaucratic apparatus clearly does not know what to do about it. In order to understand the seriousness of the situation, let us recall what this wheeler-dealing with food has served up for us.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The scientific community considers dioxins to be the most poisonous chemical that man has ever produced. They are carcinogens of the most serious category, but they also cause reductions in cell and hormonal immunity, greater susceptibility to infection, reduced fertility, increased abortions, dysfunctional ovaries, childbirth problems, greater infant mortality, problems with the development of the central nervous system, pathological changes to steroid hormones and receptors, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="sk">They do not break down. They accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, and the World Health Organisation states that if a quantity of dioxin amounting to one grain of rice gets into circulation, it is equivalent to the annual limit for one million people.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We are also finding out today that the German company Harles and Jentzsch has been adding dioxins to animal fodder, and has supplied up to 3 000 tonnes of dioxin-contaminated fat to the market since March 2010. According to current findings, contaminated eggs have made their way to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and contaminated meat to France and Denmark.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would therefore like to ask, Commissioner, how is it possible that a company supplying feed mixes to thousands of farmers is not registered in a regulated control system? What sort of cooperation can we be getting from state institutions in Germany when a company can produce feed mixes without, at the same time, being registered in a system of control? What sort of veterinary controls can there be at farms, when veterinary inspectors have failed to identify the contamination of the fodder since March 2010? Ladies and gentlemen, what is happening about the disposal of these foods? We talk about the disposed eggs and the disposed meat and what …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we are dealing with a scandal, but calling it a scandal is putting it too mildly. It is a major threat to the life and health of thousands of people. I hope those who are responsible will be identified and appropriately punished, but I hope this matter will also be cause for reflection on the model of agriculture which has arisen in the European Union. Agriculture has become an industry. We do not have animal husbandry any more – we have meat production. We have huge farms, we have the animal feed industry and we have animals raised on feed – and the feed contains dioxins. The feed also contains genetically modified materials which have not been fully tested, and this model of agriculture does not work. It is a model which does not guarantee food safety.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The solution is greater respect and regard for those farms, which we still have in Europe – in Poland and in other countries – which are based on feed they produce themselves. We ought to support this.</p>

How is it possible that this was not detected by any of the national authority inspections, so that action could be taken at that stage? Are the current mechanisms for monitoring the safety of our food really adequate? It would appear that they are not because, if they were, this dioxin crisis could have been prevented.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There seems to be any number of food scandals. Not just the dioxin crisis, but think also of the cloned products that ended up in our shops unnoticed last year. We have enough rules, but the monitoring of food safety must be more effective and more frequent and, moreover, the results of these inspections should be made public. This is about the safety of our food and the health of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to declare an interest: I am a British egg producer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dioxin contamination appears to be a consequence of the failure to adhere to the more rigorous processing standards needed for animal feed, as opposed to the less demanding process used to convert rapeseed to biofuel. The EU’s enthusiasm for biofuels can therefore have unintended consequences. In my view, however, this is not a matter for the EU. It will not be solved by – and certainly does not need – extra regulation. The Germans have identified a problem, they have told us about it and they are taking the necessary steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UK, we have a comprehensive assurance scheme called the Lion Code. It covers both animal feed production in the mill and egg production on the farm, thus ensuring that incidents like this are highly unlikely. So, if any of you are insistent on top quality eggs, ‘ask for the Lion’ and British producers will be delighted to supply you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world. Consumers need to bear that in mind right now. However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened. I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts? My second question is about how we will provide immediate support – and I mean immediate – to the breeders concerned. This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call ‘normal’ speed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode. Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels. Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council. We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, I have to agree with what several of my fellow Members have already said, namely that, to a large extent, the current legislation is working. That is not where the problem lies. The problem lies in compliance, control and sanction systems. We do not have the right at EU level to interfere in sanction systems, and we have to remember that if we make laws but do not, at the same time, have any sanction systems for them, we are simply enacting a large amount of legislation that will be completely ineffectual. This will not work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the Commissioner mentioned something that is extremely important. I was rapporteur for the regulation which forms the basis for the feed checks. The Commissioner mentioned the issue of the strict separation of raw materials intended for the feed industry and those intended for technical purposes, in this case, fat.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My proposal ten years ago was for all products of uncertain origin to be dyed. Quite honestly, I think it is a very great shame for the farmers who are affected time and again by toxins in feed but are unable to do anything about it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to be one of the signatories of this oral question because I believe that it is essential, after the incident of recent weeks, to open a debate on food safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">To what extent are the products that millions of Europeans consume every day healthy and nutritious? Are we really sure that the products on our kitchen tables are safe? Quality of raw materials is essential to guarantee the authenticity of the final product. Constant monitoring, from the field to the table, is the only way to avoid the contamination of food products and immediately identify potential risks.</p>
      <p sl="it">This latest incident in Germany confirms the need to make origin marking on labels obligatory for all products, including processed products, as Mr De Castro has already emphasised. We must protect the consumer’s right to know the provenance of every product bought, and the safety of our food can only be guaranteed by all operators sharing the responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that current European legislation already provides for controls and procedures to guarantee that the food that ends up on our tables is fit for consumption and that the risks of contamination are reduced to a minimum, but we must now aim to make a daily contribution to improving the quality of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am proud to point out that tomorrow, the Italian Parliament will approve a law that extends obligatory origin marking to all food products that do not already have it. Finally, we will know the provenance of products such as pork, long-life milk, fruit, vegetables and some drinks, such as orangeade.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that Europe can take inspiration from this law. I will make an active commitment to ensure greater transparency, information and protection of consumer rights, which are instruments that I consider essential to promote healthy, wholesome food.</p>

It is a positive thing that the Commissioner is going to Germany, and it is clear that the Council of Agriculture Ministers must discuss the matter. It would have been a scandal in itself if it had not done so. There are still things that need to be done in this area. We need strong sanctions, so that the Member States realise that they have to take a decision in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Above all, we need to put a stop to the self-controlled tests. For other sectors and companies, it is absolutely clear that compliance with the legislation is to be monitored by independent authorities, but this does not apply in the sector that produces the very food that we eat.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is absolutely no good blaming large-scale farming, price competition and whatever else. As consumers, we do not want to eat contaminated food. We need to ensure that consumers are informed about it when it does actually happen and that they are made aware of the fact that they should not have to eat contaminated food.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the December contamination in Germany which we are discussing today and the blatant breach observed in our food safety chain not only seriously put at risk the health of thousands of consumers, but also revealed remaining weaknesses in our food traceability system. It is indeed more than worrying that the German authorities, and the Commission itself, were not able to guarantee that none of the contaminated raw products, such as eggs, entered the food chain by being included as ingredients in processed food.</p>
      <p sl="en">Traceability is quite often seen as a burden for the food industry, but it appears crucial when it comes to an emergency situation such as the one discussed today and should be considered as a prerequisite in protecting consumers’ health and safety. I would therefore like to put two questions to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, can it now be certain and confirm that none of the contaminated eggs or any single product affected entered the food chain via their utilisation in processed foods?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, does it intend to reinforce traceability and information measures in order to guarantee an optimal protection of consumers in future food crises with health implications?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the German dioxin scandal has shaken the confidence of European consumers and they are rightly demanding the highest level of safety and complete traceability in food production. Ultimately, agriculture’s international reputation has been damaged by the negligent behaviour of large animal feed producers. I call on the Commission urgently to restore confidence in high quality European agricultural production, which meets the highest standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Identification of all of those responsible and limitation of the damage in the German dioxin scandal are just the start. Swift and comprehensive measures need to be taken to prevent such practices by animal feed manufacturers in the future. The animal feed chain is not somewhere to dispose of waste, and industrial waste products have no place in animal feed. I call for more stringent, EU-wide rules, particularly with regard to transport. Even one contamination of animal feed is unacceptable. However, above all, what is essential is that a full and comprehensive inspection of these companies is carried out. No farmer who is inspected several times a year can understand the current practice with regard to checks on large animal feed producers. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case we have just been discussing, the ball started rolling as a result of self reporting and the competent authorities responded correctly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most important thing, however, is to turn our attention to the farmers who have unfairly suffered damage. They urgently need support, because the damage that has occurred must not, under any circumstances, be passed on to them. The existence of thousands of farmers is currently under threat. Last Friday, the producer price in the pig fattening sector came in at EUR 0.23 per kilogram. By the end of last year, pig producers had already had to cope with a drop of EUR 0.13. The situation is made worse by the fact that the cost of feed has risen sharply in recent weeks. We need to find solutions to this quickly. Consumer confidence in agricultural products must not, under any circumstances, be jeopardised by greed and negligence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Some test results from the Agriculture Ministry in Schleswig-Holstein have shown that the fat in the feed contained 77 times the approved amount of dioxin. The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is designed to protect European consumers from exactly these types of contamination. By the time the alarm was raised, contaminated products were all over Germany and other parts of the EU, even in UK quiches, which were removed from supermarket shelves as a precautionary measure.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not the first dioxin scare. We have had problems with mozzarella from Italy, pork products in Ireland and cattle products in Northern Ireland.

These gaps must be plugged with a serious sense of responsibility towards consumers, especially at a time when the economic crisis is encouraging people to resort to illegal solutions in order to reduce production costs. We cannot, especially in times of unfavourable economic conditions, expect problems to be self-regulated on the basis of a system of moral values. Of course, consumers must have immediate and full information on the risks to which they are exposed.</p>

Consumers are currently being deliberately misled. Studies quite clearly show that people would be happy to pay. They just want the chain – where the product comes from and where it really originates from – to be fully traceable.</p>

As a consumer, I would be extremely unhappy to have to experience a situation of this sort, as would all European consumers, because it threatens to shake our trust in the safety of European products. Moreover, it angers me to find out that this happened because of persons who have intentionally broken the law, and that it was not out of genuine error.</p>
      <p sl="mt">In fact, as the final speaker has just said, no system can function where criminality is present. Where there are persons who want to break the law, then it is impossible to guarantee a system that will operate smoothly and without a hitch. This is why we need to do our utmost to ensure that we have the finest of safety nets possible in place, woven with the tiniest mesh possible, in order to avoid these criminals from slipping through the holes.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I have been involved in the drawing up of legislation in my country since 1987. In my 23 years of experience in the field, I have always found that the biggest challenge is not deciding on which clauses to enter into a piece of legislation, but trying to anticipate how that law will be broken and therefore to try and counter it from beforehand. I believe that that is the current reality of the situation. We do not want another occurrence of this sort to take place and we must do all that we can to guarantee that our system is at least capable of promptly catching those who try to sneak past the rules that are already in place, and the ones which we draw up together.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We can only act when we know what is going on, not when we are in the dark as to what is happening. Here, I would like to comment on the Rapid Alert System. I do not believe that this system did not work – indeed, it worked as it should, because the second we were alerted to the situation, the information was sent out to everyone. That is what the Rapid Alert System is all about, and in that respect it worked very well.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We also need to strengthen our rules and regulations. I agree with what Ms McGuinness said as regards the importance of establishing guidelines and laying down requirements that ensure the strictest control over food chains that carry health risks. To this end, one of the things we are trying to do, or are going to suggest, is not to focus solely on certain risk elements and require simple company registrations, such as those of feed mills, and leave it at that. Instead, post-approval should be granted after certain due diligence exercises have been carried out.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We must ensure that this incident is now kept under control. I am in constant contact with the competent German authorities and am satisfied that they are doing everything in their power, not only to contain the situation as quickly as possible and to collect all the information necessary to form a clear and whole picture of the situation, but also in terms of the action they are taking.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I have been informed, for example, that the feed mill producer who passed on false information by claiming that he had supplied just ten farms, when in fact he had supplied nine hundred, is already undergoing proceedings that have been initiated by the prosecution authorities in Germany, as this false information could have potentially led to significant consequences. We can also rest assured that the products that Germany exported, and that were intended for the food manufacturing market, such as eggs, were tested and found to contain very low levels of dioxins, since they were mixed with other non German products in the food manufacturing process.</p>
      <p sl="mt">At this juncture, since my speaking time is up, I would like to make one final comment. I fully agree that we should impose the harshest of sanctions on those who take advantage of the system. However, it is necessary to understand that these kinds of measures are not something that we can draw up or lay down in our capacity as the Commission. Rather, it is up to the Member States to decide to enforce them on a national level.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU should urge Germany and all the countries involved in this matter to take the appropriate measures to remedy the situation by imposing sanctions and ensuring that all those involved in the dioxin crisis take full responsibility for the extensive damage caused to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, and to consumers. The fact that some animal feed producers have been aware of this dioxin contamination since March 2010 without reporting it to the authorities is completely unacceptable. I therefore call for the utmost transparency in informing all the Member States and third countries of all the details surrounding the potentially contaminated feed. All food products that do not conform to EU legislation must be identified and recalled from the market. It is necessary to ensure that every measure is taken to protect public health, and for rapid and detailed information about the development of the situation to be available; this must be reported with the utmost accuracy and transparency, so that we can return to normality as soon as possible and restore vital consumer confidence in the food chain.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The subject is an important one. As you all know, the forest is receding. Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested. Clearly, this is a tragic situation. It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected – tropical forests – contain half of the world’s biodiversity. It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger – people who either live in the forests or live off them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin. It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber. The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view. At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no. Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber. They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned. Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament’s questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber. Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests – 2011 is the International Year of Forests – while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use. As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain. Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement? I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality. We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation. In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for – in particular, independent ones – so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to? In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission’s actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements. Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the tropical rainforests in Cameroon and the Congo are precious and we must welcome this voluntary agreement to address the sustainability of the harvesting of the timber that they contain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The forests belong not only to the people of these countries but they are part of the ecosystem of the planet, they are key to the life-sustaining systems and they contain billions of tonnes of carbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Halting deforestation is one of the ways that we should be tackling climate change, and governments around the globe have been trying to do this for years. These two countries should be congratulated for their courage and foresight in signing up to these voluntary agreements with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, regulating and enforcing these agreements will prove a challenge. Heaven knows, building in sustainable management of our own continent’s resources is hard enough. But the will is there and for that we should be very pleased. Careful management can bring down illegal and unsustainably imported timber.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the moment, the amount of timber that is illegally harvested and imported into the EU constitutes almost one fifth of the timber products on our markets, despite Parliament and others trying to tackle this. Enforcement will be made easier with the involvement of local people and civil society in these countries, and we must ensure that their right to be heard and involved is maintained and listened to. After all, they have the most to lose if their forests are removed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The widespread removal of tropical timber is driven by an insatiable appetite for products to grace our homes. We should value this resource better and take greater care of the resource that not only sustains a whole host of plant and animal species but is slow growing and takes many years to reach maturity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must take care not to undermine our own efforts to fight deforestation and climate change by simultaneously providing the largest market for illegal timber products in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The result of these agreements may mean that tropical timber reaches a higher price, and that is something that we should not object to. It is not only a limited resource, but it is the only thing that local people have to sell. They know the true value of their resource and with this agreement, so will we.</p>
      <p sl="en">These people are our eyes and ears in the forest and we need their help to enforce the agreements. They need us to support their ability to voice any concerns. These agreements are a two-way process and we look to you, Commissioner, to be able to enforce it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The VPAs (Voluntary Partnership Agreements) are good for the planet, good for our partner countries and good for the EU. We must ensure that the agreements work and that any breaches are monitored and addressed. Then we must look to other countries in Africa, Asia and South America to sign up to similar agreements as soon as possible and I look forward to working with you and the Commission to achieve this.</p>

    <intervention id="1-102-000" speaker_id="1403" name="David Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me begin by thanking Yannick Jadot for his exemplary cooperation with his shadows. We all worked extremely well on this report and I am delighted – as he has said – that we managed to reach a broad consensus.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreements with Congo and Cameroon, taken together with Ghana, means that some of Africa’s most vulnerable forests are now covered by Voluntary Partnership Agreements. The existence of these agreements, as the two previous speakers have said, is to be warmly welcomed. They provide a mechanism for tackling the massive illegal trade in timber. They provide an opportunity for the better management of a vital natural resource and, hopefully, they will bring greater transparency and help us tackle corruption in the forest sector, which, unfortunately in Africa, is endemic at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, while welcoming these agreements, I nevertheless share with the rapporteur a number of concerns. I would just like to express three this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">First and foremost, the danger – it is not the intention, but there is a danger – of agreeing such a framework is that it is seen as providing a framework for large-scale exploitation of our forests, leading to the opposite of the purpose of the agreement, namely, further degradation and further deforestation, thus contributing to the very destruction of the global environment we are trying to avoid. What we want is an agreement that contributes to the conservation and sustainable management of our biodiversity resources. I agree with the rapporteur that this means that the Commission has to constantly monitor the situation and report back regularly on how the agreement is progressing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, indigenous people, who are so often the victims of environmental exploitation, should benefit from this agreement. The promise in the Voluntary Partnership Agreement by the Congolese Government to promote a law ensuring that the rights of indigenous people are promoted and respected must be delivered upon. Again, I urge the Commission, in their contact with the government, to continually press for the delivery of this promise until it is there on the statute book in the Congo.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we must ensure – and I agree with Catherine Bearder who mentioned this – that appropriate funds are available to properly implement this agreement. No matter how good an agreement is on paper, without the resources to carry it out, it is a meaningless piece of paper. As has been indicated, there are no financial packages attached to the agreement itself. It is up to us – both the Commission to propose, and Parliament and Council to put into the budget appropriate budgetary facilities – to make this agreement work. That means we need to have money to verify the legality of timber coming into the European Union, we need money to train, equip and give the technical expertise to those operating in the African countries we have VPAs with, and we also need resources to carry out the monitoring that I have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we need to make sure, in the coming months, that we deliver the financial framework to make a success of these agreements. I repeat that these are good agreements but, like all agreements, they will depend on the goodwill and vigilance of individuals – the non-government organisations, the Member States, the Congolese and Cameroon governments – to deliver on their promises to make sure these agreements work in practice. They should lead to better management of our forests and better management of vital global resources but, if wrongly handled, they could take us in the opposite direction. We look to the Commission to keep a beady eye on the progress that is being made.</p>

    <intervention id="1-103-000" speaker_id="96669" name="Joe Higgins" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, we agree with the general approach of Yannick Jadot to this issue. I welcome any agreement that guarantees protection of the rainforests of our planet, if such agreements also advance the protection of the indigenous people of the forest and give a better life to the majority of the people in the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">It must be said at the start that both the Republic of Congo and Cameroon have highly repressive governments. Cameroon is very high in the Corruption Index kept by Transparency International, and in the Republic of Congo, there has been horrific exploitation of some sections of the population, notably the pygmy people, although a new law has just been passed and people will wait to see what this does to protect indigenous people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The logging industry in these countries is implicated in corruption and in the exploitation of workers and the deforestation involved is a huge threat to the livelihoods of the indigenous people. It is for this reason that the original resolution of the European United Left Group calls for the logging industry to be in public ownership and under democratic control, crucially involving workers in the industry and the indigenous communities in the forests affected by logging.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Left’s resolution also points out that illegal logging is related to poverty levels in the countries concerned. It can provide an income for individuals and their families who would otherwise go hungry, and therefore, ending illegal logging is also linked to ending the poverty and deprivation of many communities in the relevant countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will not be done by the corrupt local elites, nor by European multinational corporations whose key motivation is private profit, but by the forestry workers and the indigenous peoples themselves taking democratic ownership of their resources. In this sense, the people of sub-Saharan Africa can take inspiration from their brothers and sisters in Tunisia in their heroic struggle against a corrupt dictatorship over the past weeks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, several countries that export tropical hardwood have started to sign voluntary partnership agreements with the EU under the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. The European Union will provide support for forest governance reforms and capacity building, in particular, the implementation of traceability and legality verification systems for wood-based products.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is something I believe to be particularly important: if it helps to improve transparency and prevent environmental damage in connection with forestry activities, then it is a good thing for the partners to commit to amending and improving current legal provisions. I also expressly welcome the fact that the European Union has made a commitment to provide support for capacity building in the timber producing countries, particularly in connection with the implementation of traceability and legality verification systems for timber and wood-based products.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two more points I would like to mention. The idea behind the voluntary partnership agreements is to put an end to the trade in illegally felled wood and products made from this wood and to help to stop deforestation, forest degradation and their effects in the form of CO2 emissions, as well as the loss of biodiversity, throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Further large-scale exploitation of tropical and other particularly species-rich forests with a high carbon storage capacity is irresponsible and may lead to further deforestation and forest degradation, with devastating consequences for the environment worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">These agreements are therefore a small, but positive step in the right direction. I am in complete agreement with the points made by the previous speakers. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation and I would be very pleased if we could make real progress with these agreements in order to make our world a little bit better.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-105-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, for his support for the Voluntary Partnership Agreements on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade with Congo and Cameroon. I hope this House will follow the recommendations for consent to conclude these two agreements. This would also encourage the parliaments in both Cameroon and Congo to complete their consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that both the European Union and our partner countries endorse the VPAs, since illegal logging is a problem for all. I know that illegal logging is just the visible tip of the iceberg. Basically, we are talking about starting to work together for sustainable management of forestry resources. And, to answer one of the rapporteur’s suggestions immediately, I could say that, yes, I am ready to come here every six months, as Parliament calls me, to monitor the implementation of these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that this is a commitment. There are risks but this is the only way, in my opinion, to achieve really sustainable management of this resource, because if we do not do this, we will not manage to be successful through declarations alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">For our partner countries, there is a lot of commitment, but I believe that one important factor is the loss that results from illegal logging. Each year, USD 10-15 billion is lost in revenue. Illegal logging also has extremely negative consequences for indigenous peoples, for biodiversity and in terms of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is also important to emphasise that the EU is one of the biggest markets for tropical wood. This means that our approach is extremely important in how the whole issue is being addressed. Of the tropical wood arriving in the EU, 20% comes from illegal sources, so we have an obligation to ensure that we source only legal wood.</p>
      <p sl="en">The climate change issue is another concern for everyone, and the protection of forests needs to start somewhere. It is very simple to say that we need to pay to protect forests: it is a simple formula, but applying it requires a lot of commitment from both sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall try to answer a couple of questions that have been put to me. On enforcement and implementation, the VPA establishes a joint committee to monitor implementation of the agreement. It will also establish an independent audit to analyse the legality assurance system and its effectiveness and efficiency. There is also an annual reporting mechanism, and the annual report will be made public and will definitely be available to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, in preparation for the VPAs, we have involved civil society and indigenous peoples. Until now, they had been completely left out of the process, so we have agreed, under the new agreements, to set up multi-stakeholder committees to monitor, or guide, the implementation process where indigenous people are involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the VPAs include a complaints mechanism, and the independent auditor will have access to, and will rely on, information from a wide array of sources, including civil society and communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a definite cost in terms of resources. Between 2002 and 2008, the EU contributed EUR 544 million to forestry in general in the developing world, some of it directed to FLEGT work in individual countries. The Commission has so far spent a further EUR 35 million to support FLEGT more generally, and we will spend EUR 35 million more between 2011 and 2013. I would emphasise, too, that Member States also make fiscal contributions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also dedicated human resources to the implementation of FLEGT. I have seven civil servants dealing with this, and they are working closely with the European Forest Institute and national forest authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">An additional effort has been made in the form of the Illegal Timber Regulation, adopted in 2010 as a key element of the FLEGT action plan, and this will complement the VPA approach. It will discourage unregulated, unsustainable exploitation of forests.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent agreement in Cancún on action to reduce emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation (known as ‘REDD’) will facilitate further Commission support for developing countries. Our future work on forest governance through VPAs will be helped by the fact that REDD makes provision for governance and for observance of the rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take note of the human rights situation in partner countries. I agree with the draft motion for a resolution that the Commission should continue to focus on these issues. I can assure you that we keep human rights issues at the centre of our political dialogue with the partner countries, and I can assure you that the fight against corruption is one of the issues we address when dealing with the partner countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would emphasise one particular point that represents encouragement for the whole process: the fact that partner countries feel engaged. Without real engagement from our partner countries, given all the weaknesses at administrative level, we cannot protect forests more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that this is the start of the process, but it is a start being made by both sides, and I am always ready to come to Parliament to report on how the implementation is going. However, with FLEGT, we are definitely not taking a wrong step. It is a step in the right direction: we are not increasing the risk. Perhaps we are not providing entirely sufficient solutions, but at least it is a decent step that we can be proud of.</p>

      <p sl="fr">If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations. It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, these Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) agreements that we are to vote on tomorrow concerning Congo and Cameroon are important European tools, or weapons, in the fight against illegal logging and, for that reason, I welcome them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Illegal logging is a huge problem, both in terms of the environment and from an economic and social point of view. At the same time, it is important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself, in this case illegal logging, that creates the conditions for trade in illegal timber. Instead, this is a symptom and a consequence of many other problems that, in many cases, are even more serious – poverty, lack of ownership rights, corruption and, in certain cases, war.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The problems are greatest in some of the world’s poorest countries. I am therefore very pleased that the Commission bore that in mind when drawing up and negotiating the agreements. We could say that we have provided free trade in exchange for the countries concerned making reforms to strengthen ownership rights, fight corruption and ensure the introduction of reasonable forestry legislation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That fact that we are tackling the root causes rather than the symptoms is what gives us the best indication that what we are going to do tomorrow is a step in the right direction. At the same time, it is important to remember, particularly ahead of forthcoming negotiations with other countries, that in our fight against trade in illegally logged timber, we must not prevent poor countries from exporting one of their more valuable raw materials. We must not make it harder for them to use wood, which is a fantastic natural material. The good is not the enemy of the best.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to remind you that my country, Sweden, became rich at one time precisely by exporting timber. We must not prevent the poor countries of today from taking that opportunity. As you now go further and negotiate the agreements, I hope that you will continue to fight specifically against illegally logged timber and not against the trade in timber.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Commission has initiated the process of concluding voluntary partnership agreements with countries which export timber to the European Union. In this context, I think that it is important to set up a structure promoting the active involvement of local communities, with a view both to monitoring the agreement’s implementation and improving the forest governance framework and, last but not least, in order to prevent corruption as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Involving civil society in the process of drafting the agreement with Cameroon is a positive indication of this. At the same time, specific measures are required to continue this kind of dialogue in all the signatory countries. It is also important to aim at developing a socially and environmentally sustainable timber industry, including through the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation in these countries. The agreements must comply with the European Union’s international environmental and sustainable development commitments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we are debating Voluntary Partnership Agreements. These are lovely words, they are good words: they represent a European Union that is not trying to impose its will upon developing nations but is trying to lend a helping hand to achieve common goals. Yet the practicalities of an agreement with a state the size of Congo create all sorts of daunting problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">The size of the state alone is something akin to that of Europe; the governance for much of that state is non-existent; corruption levels are quite extraordinary – Transparency International puts the Republic of Congo almost bottom of its league table.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then there is the number of staff we have working to ensure that this agreement delivers on its goals – just a handful of people; the profits of illegal logging are absolutely vast and perhaps greater than anything we can offer by way of compensation; and the markets for illegal wood are in countries like China, which may not be paying anything like the attention that we pay, and the respect that should be paid, to maintaining forests.</p>
      <p sl="de">All these problems suggest that voluntary partnerships, however good our intentions, will have difficulty delivering the goals. So what assurances can the Commission give us that every possible step will be taken to ensure that our high ambitions here will truly be realised, and that we can all have confidence that these voluntary partnership agreements, as we make them in future, will deliver on the goals we have set?</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the Earth’s forests are the lungs of the planet, and we must do everything we can to protect them. At a time of rapid global population growth and, with that, a generally increasing need for resources, jobs moving to distant parts of the world and an economic crisis, I think that in the EU, we need more European timber rather than importing exotic timber from countries where it is difficult to control illegal logging and where we cannot control the corruption either.</p>
      <p sl="da">By clearing tropical forests, we are reducing the biodiversity in the areas concerned and contributing to the extinction of a long list of endangered species. We are also altering the climate. This is completely unnecessary, particularly when there are perfectly good alternatives. If we learn to plant more forest in Europe again and use more European timber, these problems will disappear. Why should our garden tables be made of wood from the rainforest and why are exotic parquet floors better than floors made of EU wood?</p>
      <p sl="da">However, having said that, and because I cannot stop EU citizens using exotic and tropical timber, it is important that these agreements are adopted. It is important that we help to ensure that there is an improvement in the control of timber products and the timber we import. We must try to safeguard ourselves against corruption, which is extremely difficult, as reflected in the agreements. I am therefore under no illusion that we will succeed in putting an end to all illegal logging in either Cameroon or Congo – unfortunately. I would have preferred the agreements to be binding rather than voluntary. However, it is clearly better to have voluntary agreements than no agreements at all and therefore I support them.</p>
      <p sl="da">In general, however, I hope to see more initiatives to protect the world’s forests, particularly when it comes to the EU’s agreements with countries from problematic parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in my opinion, although the partnership agreement with Cameroon in the forestry sector is indeed praiseworthy and comes during the International Year of Forests, it is also a very convenient way for the EU to improve its image. However, as to whether the agreement is worth the paper it is written on, I have my doubts, unfortunately.</p>
      <p sl="de">After all, corruption is a topical issue in Cameroon. Accusations against the state by environmental organisations claim that the government is very well aware of the environmental crimes of the forestry industry but is preventing monitoring and prosecutions from being carried out. After all, foreign companies are said to control more than 60% of the timber production and processing and three quarters of the timber exports. Only if it can be guaranteed that foreign companies are no longer wiping the floor with local companies, which completely lack forestry and environmental expertise, and if Cameroon gets to grips with the corruption, will this sort of agreement have any meaning. With all the concern about the destruction of the rainforests, this must not be used as an excuse to prevent forest owners in Europe from exploiting their forests, because forest management in most EU Member States is exemplary.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, a month ago, I was in the Republic of Congo with the delegation of the Committee on Development, where our talks with government representatives and with experts and non-governmental organisations also covered the FLEGT initiative.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The timber industry is a very important one for the country. After crude oil, it is the second largest source of export income. It should be remembered that what happens to income from crude oil and how it is used is not completely transparent or clear to us, or at least the information is sent with a long delay. At the same time, the government of the Republic of Congo is expressing concern about the future of its forest areas and is planning a huge afforestation campaign. Of course, we still do not know if this afforestation programme will be successful, but we should certainly wish the government of Congo all the best in its endeavours. This is why it is so important to strengthen legal trade in timber. It is equally important for FLEGT to operate in neighbouring countries, because otherwise, as a result of smuggling, for example, the agreement may prove to be ineffective in practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Neither do we yet know if the standards we are promoting on the legal trade in timber will come into force and operate globally – some speakers have already called attention to this problem. One way or another, we must try to ensure that the system proves effective. We must also help in putting pressure on other importers, from outside Europe, to ensure the gradual elimination of illegal trade in timber.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The FLEGT initiative is important, both for reducing poverty and for protecting the environment – for controlling the phenomenon of deforestation and developing a diversified economy in many countries. In the case of the Republic of Congo, this goes hand-in-hand with another need, which is the need to develop agriculture and reduce food imports. Thanks to FLEGT, international trade in timber can become fairer, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly. We hope this will be the case.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations on the completion, to all intents and purposes, of negotiations on these two agreements. However, I should like to express my concern at the fact that the FLEGT negotiations with Indonesia and Malaysia have deadlocked.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, the Commission has an important instrument in its hands: the regulation on timber. This regulation exempts the countries with which a FLEGT agreement has been concluded from the scope of the regulation. It is an important instrument for giving new impetus to the negotiations. We really do need to conclude FLEGT agreements with all countries with important tropical forests in either Asia or Latin America and with the major timber dealers, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China and numerous other countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">These countries are taking their own way forward; they are adopting their own procedures for modernising and monitoring legal logging. The question is: are we doing what we need to do? Are the 27 Member States passing decisions regulating imports of timber from FLEGT countries?</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, a series of delegated acts is needed for the timber regulation. We have two years until the regulation applies in full. The Commission needs to speed up the procedures, to issue delegated acts, so that the countries know the details and what they need to do to adapt.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, illegal logging in Central African countries, such as Cameroon and the Congo, constitutes a threat to the integrity of resources on which the local communities and indigenous peoples depend for their existence and way of life. Indeed, it is a threat to an ecosystem that is home to enormous biodiversity and plays a very important role in regulating biogeochemical cycles.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given the advancing destruction of the tropical rainforest in this region – and let us not forget that it is fed by the demand of operators and importers in industrialised countries, particularly countries in the European Union – the solution cannot possibly be to legalise what is illegal today, the unsustainable exploitation of the rainforest, which would be nothing short of a legitimisation of the theft of land from the local communities and the occupation of vast areas of rainforest by timber companies, as has been occurring.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union’s development cooperation and aid policy has a very important role to play here in supporting the diversification of the economy of these countries and turning a model based heavily on the extraction and export of a small number of raw materials to industrialised countries completely on its head.</p>

I am therefore very pleased that this debate is taking place. It is important for all of us that the demand for timber is satisfied in future, too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, forty percent of Cameroon’s surface area is covered in forest. Yet, we have to say, that although Cameroon is the largest exporter of tropical wood in Africa, in no other country are the forests being so extensively cleared.</p>
      <p sl="de">Experts estimate that, in 10 to 15 years, the ecologically important tree species from the Congo Basin will have disappeared if the logging continues as it has done. What can we do about this? What is important for the protection of Cameroon’s tropical forests is, above all, that corruption is combated, both at the level of the officials and also where the private tenant farmers are concerned, that effective criminal prosecutions continue to be carried out and, of course, that sustainable forestry is practised. Where a lot of felling takes place, there must also be regeneration. Something that is very important is better training in logging work in order to avoid premature damage during clearing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, European companies must take some responsibility, because around 80% of the yield is shipped to Europe. The EU must also act accordingly in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures. A voluntary agreement is all well and good, but in this context, it will not get us anywhere. We need to make the companies accountable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the debate definitely went beyond the scope of this Voluntary Partnership Agreement. It is not only trade that affects forests: the forest is an energy resource for these countries, and population growth also has an impact on the forest.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I would like to emphasise again that this is a first step in addressing just one of the areas of concern. I know that it is not a solution, but you have to start somewhere in addressing the issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, I would not like to discourage you with regard to the level of commitment of the countries concerned. I know that dealing with these countries is sometimes not simple, but they are countries with a difficult history. They got their independence 50 years ago, and not exactly in the same circumstances as some of our countries got independence, so things take time. It takes time to establish state institutions capable of fighting corruption or establishing the management of resources, and they are on the right track. In Africa, in particular, they have economic growth even in times of crisis, and this means they are getting stronger and getting better.</p>
      <p sl="en">I realise this is just one indicator, but overall, there has been encouraging news, and the only way we can improve the process is by working together. That is where we come in with sustainable forest management: we are talking about Congo-Brazzaville (the Republic of the Congo) and Cameroon today, but we are also working with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and with Indonesia. We are still negotiating but we have high hopes of a positive conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I would say that the risks here are minimal. Commitment is the starting point and I look on this process as a very positive one.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also consider the global commitment to fight climate change. Cancún gave some assurances that other parts of the world also take things seriously in that regard. We are not the only ones who would like the world to be fair and sustainable, and other parts of the world will learn from us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us take, for example, energy efficiency drives. We made a start, and other parts of the world have followed. The same applies to resource efficiency. If we can use less timber, then other parts of the world will definitely learn from our example. I believe there are a lot of ways in which we can lead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, I would like, once again, to guarantee that the Commission will conduct monitoring, not only by my own staff, but also through the EU delegations and the Member State delegations that we have. This is one of the processes in which we share our efforts with the Member States. The Commission does not simply work alone and, in many respects, Member States’ experience has been particularly crucial in concluding this voluntary partnership agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask this House really very much to deal with this consent process because I believe it is a healthy process, it goes in the right direction and, at the same time, does not provide the answers on all the issues that you have raised today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society. As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen – as the history of Côte d’Ivoire unfortunately reminds us – we will not make sufficient progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, strengthening civil society – the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation – is essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: ‘Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe – social, democratic and environmental criteria – when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?’ Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also – and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry – a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export. Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements were a good basis on which to build international cooperation to tackle the problem of deforestation. And they continue to show their relevance today, especially in the context of last year’s illegal timber regulation. Countries which adhere to such voluntary schemes are able to give certain guarantees about the legality and environmental sustainability of their timber sources. There are clear benefits in terms of environmental protection, although we should be mindful of the fact that trade in legally harvested timber is not necessarily sensitive to the needs of indigenous people. It is important that, as more VPAs are agreed, their effects are closely monitored and that their terms take full account of the needs and human rights of people who are dependent on forests, but who often do not have a voice in the management of those forests.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would like to say that I know that, for good reasons, Commissioner De Gucht cannot be with us this evening. I would like to thank him for taking the trouble to call me last week and explain why he is unable to be here, and I would like to thank him and his team at DG Trade for their cooperation and, in particular, Martin Dihm for all his assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have tried, in my role as rapporteur, to follow on from the good work of the previous rapporteur, my former colleague Glyn Ford. I am fortunate that the adoption of Glyn’s resolution in 2009 meant that Parliament already had a clear position on the EC-Pacific Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. Parliament’s formal position then is the one that I have tried to follow in my report and question today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Donatella Pribaz, who was the committee administrator responsible. This turned out to be her last report for the committee before her promotion, so I would like to wish her well in her new job and thank her for making my task here easier. Finally, in terms of acknowledgements, I would also like to welcome the presence here of the Ambassador for Papua New Guinea and to thank him and his staff for their close collaboration. The insights they provided allowed me to make specific input to the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would like to make a few general remarks on the agreement and the regional context. Secondly, I plan to discuss three specific aspects of the EPA which I believe it is important to highlight: namely, Aid for Trade, the Fijian political situation and fisheries. Thirdly, I will comment on the future of EC-Pacific trading relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the background and regional integration, this interim – or goods only – EPA has been negotiated with two Pacific states – Papua New Guinea and Fiji. These are the two Pacific island states that have the highest levels of trade with the EU and have key exports destined for the EU market: tuna and sugar respectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EPA gives Papua New Guinea and Fiji duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market in return for the gradual liberalisation of their markets over a 15-year period. Papua New Guinea has committed to liberalising 88% of EU imports on the date of application of this agreement, and Fiji will liberalise 87% over a 15-year period.</p>
      <p sl="en">The remaining 12 Pacific states either enjoy duty-free and quota-free access through the Everything But Arms scheme or, because of their low level of trade with the EU, have very little interest in an interim EPA. Nevertheless, I believe it is important that, as we move towards a full EPA, we should pursue our objective of regional integration and continue to press for a full EPA involving all the Pacific states.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the content of the resolution, Parliament has to consent to this agreement before it can be ratified. We will vote on Wednesday – as you have indicated, Madam President – on two different reports, firstly, on consent, which I am recommending that we give, and secondly on the accompanying motion for a resolution. There are other issues in the motion for a resolution but, as I have said, I want to comment particularly on three.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, regarding Aid for Trade, funding for implementation is crucial to achieving the agreement’s objectives of economic diversification and poverty alleviation. It is important that a fair and equitable share of the EUR 2 billion set aside in the 2007 Aid for Trade strategy is directed towards the Pacific region. It is also important to highlight that this interim EPA was conceived as a short-term measure to safeguard the Pacific’s trade preferences following the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bearing that in mind, it should not be seen as a sign of EU acceptance of the political regime in Fiji. I would urge the Fijian Government to make moves towards democracy. I hope that the necessary reforms can take place to allow financial support for the Fijian sugar industry to be allocated.</p>
      <p sl="en">On fishing, the fisheries sector plays a key role in Papua New Guinea’s economy and – importantly – provides employment and income to its citizens. In the three tuna processing plants which export to the EU, there are 5 700 employees, the majority of whom are women. This is a country where it is sometimes difficult to find good employment for women.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the purpose of the flexible rules of origin in this agreement, namely, to develop the processing industry, but it is essential that the industry develops in a sustainable manner. Environmental considerations are paramount and I have asked, in my report, for the Commission to monitor this aspect and to report back regularly to Parliament on compliance with the regulation on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate that there are some concerns in this House – and specifically in the Committee on Fisheries – about the potential impact of Papua New Guinea’s tuna imports on the EU industry. However, when we look at the latest figures, we can see that during the period 2003-2009, imports made up around only 2% of total preserved and prepared fish imports and around only 3% of preserved and prepared tuna imports. I do not believe that this low level of imports will threaten the domestic EU industry, especially if we take into account the limited capacity of the Pacific states’ fishing fleets and the limited on-land processing capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, it is, of course, right that we should continue to monitor the situation and that, if there are any unexpected increases in fishing products coming from Papua New Guinea, the Commission should take appropriate action. As I mentioned earlier, I hope that the Pacific states can agree a comprehensive regional EPA.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my report, I have recommended the inclusion of several points of substance in future negotiations, which I hope the Commission will take into account. These include intellectual property. Too often, we talk about intellectual property from one side only, but I hope that we will look at intellectual property in terms of including traditional knowledge. I also hope we will add transparency in government procurement as well as provision for issuing working visas of up to 24 months.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we move towards a full EPA, I hope the Commission will involve all the Pacific states but, in the meantime, let us press ahead and get the interim EPA with PNG and Fiji on the books and working as a demonstration of what we can achieve in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and particularly for his positive attitude on consent to the interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea and Fiji. I hope that this House will follow his advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consent by the European Parliament – for the first time on a trade agreement under the Lisbon Treaty – has important political significance because this is a trade agreement with a long-term development focus and because of the momentum it will provide to ongoing negotiations on the comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Back in 2007, the immediate purpose of the interim agreement was to secure continued access to the EU market for those countries in the Pacific region which most depend on it, given the impending expiry of the Cotonou trade regime. The Commission’s commitment to concluding negotiations on a comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region as a whole remains unchanged and we are currently engaged in negotiations with our Pacific partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can go forward only if we accept the special nature of the Pacific region and tailor the EPA accordingly. We are talking about small and remote island states which differ greatly in their economic situation, development needs and relations with the EU. Some countries have ‘least developed country’ status and are therefore covered by the EU’s Everything But Arms trade regime; some have little, if any, trade with the Union. We are therefore open to entering into the trade relationships that best suit the Pacific region as a whole, and the ongoing negotiations will inform the ultimate choices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whatever approach we opt for, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that any agreement will indeed contribute to the development of the countries concerned. That is why there is also financial assistance to enhance trade capacity. That is why we will allow partner countries in the developing world to exclude more sensitive products from the trade agreements: something that we would not allow other countries to do. In this context, I have duly taken note of the concerns expressed about the derogation in the interim EPA from the standard rules of origin for fisheries products.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is precisely for development reasons that we granted this derogation and we did so on the basis of our informed judgment that Papua New Guinea’s small market share makes it unlikely that its tuna exports could damage the interests of the EU industry. The European Union and Papua New Guinea have applied these rules provisionally since 2008 and, whereas export figures have fluctuated, no upward trend has been detected. Let me also reassure you that the Commission does not intend to offer similar arrangements to any other region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will, in any event, closely monitor the implementation of the derogation and will report to Parliament on the basis of a study which will be prepared before the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you were also present in September last year when the current elected Prime Minister addressed the INTA Committee. He expressed the readiness of his government to grant EU vessels and investors access to Papua New Guinea’s waters. We take this oral declaration very seriously and we will continue to engage with our partners till it comes to fruition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s consent will allow us to launch the implementation mechanisms provided for the agreement; one of these is the Trade Committee, which could be convened this spring and which provides a platform for raising all the issues relating to mutual obligations under the interim EPA. Your vote is therefore crucial to helping us move forward on this and other important issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to Fiji, the country did sign the interim EPA but it does not apply it provisionally. This makes Papua New Guinea currently the only country provisionally applying the EU-Pacific interim EPA. Fiji continues, for the time being, to have access to the EU market under the Market Access Regulation, since the Council has not adopted trade sanctions. As you are aware, the EU decided to suspend development aid to Fiji because of the political situation in the country. Resumption of aid would presuppose progress in governance in Fiji and, in particular, a return to democratic principles of government, but at the moment, there is no tangible progress in Fiji in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EPA we have discussed today is only an interim arrangement to ensure that access to the EU market is not lost. The Commission is fully committed to continue negotiations on a comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help. Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources. However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union. It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea’s fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry.</p>
      <p sl="es">Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development. However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it. Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken. I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, I would like to start by saying that we welcome the increasing role of the EU as a trading power in every region of the world, including the Pacific region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement, as it is now, is not a perfect one, not least because it is not a comprehensive EPA, but only an interim one. We hope that the Commission will be in a position to negotiate, in due time, a comprehensive EPA including a larger number of countries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the current agreement concerns only a small part of EU trade, since the share of EU trade accounted for by the whole of the Pacific region is just 0.06%, and yet some areas have caused us concern, most notably on the issue of the derogation from the rules of origin for fishery products.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our resolution, we raise our concern that a number of countries, such as the Philippines, Thailand, China, the United States, Australia and others, will be able to take advantage of this derogation and potentially export large quantities of processed fisheries products to the EU, potentially harming the interests of the EU fish processing and canning industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore encourage the Commission to act on Parliament’s request for it to conduct an impact assessment study and, in the event that the assessment demonstrates a destabilising effect on the EU’s fish processing and canning industry, for it to initiate the procedure leading to suspension of the exceptional arrangements in this agreement regarding rules of origin.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the current Interim Partnership Agreement signed in November 2007 by the European Commission and the states of Papua New Guinea and Fiji was heavily criticised by civil society and politicians in the Pacific region. They highlighted the adverse impact the agreement has had on the level of regional solidarity and the political desire for economic integration in the region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The region was split into groupings which negotiated on an individual basis and under pressure to reach an interim agreement with the European Commission. At the same time, granting originating product status and an exemption from EU customs duties for fish products originating from Papua New Guinea and Fiji is believed to have led to a processing centre for these products, including some non-originating products, being set up by companies from neighbouring countries with the aim of enjoying the benefits of the exemption.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This process would have an adverse impact on the industry, workers and local incomes, given that the fishing industry is one of the most important creators of jobs in these countries. It would also mean unfair competition for EU products. As a result, the agreement may have had the opposite to the desired effect.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, the European Commission must ensure that the future partnership agreement will make a contribution both to the development of a sustainable local fishing industry which creates jobs and to closer regional integration, for instance, through negotiating the future agreement with the entire Pacific region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the objectives of the EPAs is to promote regional integration. What we have seen so far is that this is not happening. On the contrary, in the case of the Pacific, the EU is undermining unity by offering interim agreements to some ACP countries, with special conditions attached.</p>
      <p sl="en">The derogation from the rules of origin for fish processed in Papua New Guinea and Fiji is an example of this. I believe that this derogation is potentially hazardous and that it must be thoroughly evaluated in 2011, as already agreed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say this because it is important to have facts when discussing this matter. What are the effects on global fish stocks, on employment and on the environment in Papua New Guinea? What are the social conditions of the workers? All this must be fully and transparently assessed, and then the derogation may or may not be abolished on that basis, and not on the basis of complaints from the Spanish fishing industry which, itself, fishes in Papua New Guinea but never lands fish there – and, by the way, does not pay customs duty when it sells the fish as European on the European market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I think that it is a slight exaggeration to call the Interim Economic Partnership Agreements ‘Pacific Agreements’, since, of the 15 ACP States in the area, only two are signatories to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, these agreements more often take the form of bilateral agreements than of genuine regional agreements, bilateral agreements which deviate from the much vaunted objective of the EPAs, namely, regional integration. It is hard not to see in this an illustration of what members of civil society are complaining about, in the Pacific as well as in Africa, namely, the fact that a number of ACP countries have been forced to sign individual agreements because the Commission has not managed to turn the EPAs into a genuine instrument of development partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The strong pressures exerted on the ACP States by the European negotiators were criticised by the ACP countries themselves during the 92nd Session of the ACP Council of Ministers, which took place in Brussels from 8 to 12 November 2010. The reality of the EPAs negotiated by the European Commission is so tragic that they failed even before they came into force. They were such a failure that a number of ACP countries are asking the Member States of the European Union to examine the possibility of revising the negotiating mandate given to the European Commission in June 2002.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in conjunction with the current market situation, the reform of the EU sugar market regime will result in the EU sugar price falling below the international price.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this price situation, the long-term supply commitments with the sugar cane producers in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific will probably be very difficult to maintain. The fact that farmers in the ACP countries would prefer to sell their goods at higher prices on the world market instead of selling them cheaply in the EU may have contributed to the difficulties experienced in connection with the new ACP agreements. If this incentive is now being removed and, at the same time, they have to accept a most favoured nation clause, coupled with the fact that the state revenue will fall as a result of the loss of revenue from duties, it is no wonder that the ACP countries were so hesitant.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, attention surely needs to be paid to fisheries, and not only whether Papua New Guinea and Fiji have granted other trade partners access to their fishing waters. Perhaps we should also investigate whether the accusations are correct that, for example, on account of the EU restrictions and catch quotas, the Spanish fishing fleet has relocated to the Pacific and is fishing there under a foreign flag.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency.</p>
      <p sl="es">This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="es">That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied. Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry’s major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States. It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country’s low wages and non-existent environmental standards.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment. I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible. It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made. I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement. Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified.</p>

      <p sl="es">However, what negative effects are there due to third countries benefiting from this preferential treatment?</p>
      <p sl="es">Here, we are hearing the complaints that are being made. We want a balanced situation. The Commission has just told us that there is clear research, but the opinion being expressed here is that this is not the case. In 2008, it was said that there was no distortion of any kind, and we were told that there would be an impact assessment.</p>

We also want to know whether health measures – which are very important for imported products – are being complied with, along with sustainable fisheries management, and combating illegal fishing, which is essential. Another very important element that would show us how the third countries that may be based in Papua New Guinea work is compliance with international employment rules.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention to the derogation from the rules of origin granted to Papua New Guinea concerning processed fishery products, especially canned tuna. I believe that the derogation is extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This ACP country benefits from preferential access to the European market; that is, from a total exemption from all customs duties on the canned tuna that it exports to our market. I am not questioning the development policy implemented by the agreement. However, the derogation from the rules of origin on canned tuna is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This derogation allows external operators to set themselves up in Papua New Guinea, and so it benefits jobs and the local population only to a very limited extent. We must allow development aid, but fair and effective aid which benefits the regions concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Community imports of tuna increased from 9 200 to 16 200 tonnes between 2008 and 2009. They doubled in just one year. This phenomenon can only get worse if this derogation is maintained. What is more, these products do not respect the same social, health and preservation standards for resources that are imposed on European products. In particular, it is impossible to verify the origin of catches.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, has the European Commission not taken the time to read my report on the origin of imports of fishery and aquaculture products in the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If not, the situation is hopeless. We cannot sacrifice European jobs and the quality of the products sold on the European market in this way. I do not want a situation which will have a destructive effect on the European processing industry to be introduced indefinitely.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting. In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea. I support the Commission’s idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world. I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy. At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region. In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin. I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea’s development and on the European canning industry. If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="es">I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one. I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry. This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended. I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations. However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there. I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">This specific issue did not arise, but I would just like to stand up and support those colleagues who have expressed huge concern about a proposal that is supposed to be positive as a development tool but, in fact, could be quite negative, not just from a European perspective, but also for the very countries we are trying to assist.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this was an extremely interesting debate. There is poverty in the world. We need to deal with it. One way would be the transfer of financial resources, but it is much better to give the people the opportunity to make a decent living from the work they do. The three tuna processing facilities in Papua New Guinea which are authorised to export tuna to the EU employ around 5 700 people, most of whom are women. Jobs are at stake in Papua New Guinea, which is one of the most poverty-stricken countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it proposes derogations, the Commission takes due account of the risks involved and looks to create safeguards. The Commission takes the view that it is highly unlikely that Papua New Guinea’s exports will cause any serious disruption to the EU’s fishing and canning industry given the low volume of trade between Papua New Guinea and the EU, and Papua New Guinea’s low market share in the EU tuna market of around 3% in recent years. Provisional application dates from 2008, and we have some experience with figures. It will not cause any disruption to Europe’s fishing or canning industries. The development of trade flows will be further analysed in a study on the effect of the implementation of the special rules of origin for fishery products which will be prepared in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the Commission will monitor trade with PNG and will not hesitate to take appropriate measures if a serious disturbance of the EU market becomes evident. The Interim Agreement explicitly allows for the application of such measures in its Chapter 2 on trade defence instruments. There is no indication at this stage of any negative impact of Papua New Guinea’s exports of fishery products on the canning industry in other ACP or GSP+ countries. This aspect will also be looked at in the study I have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to add that, independently of any special rules of origin or preferential trade agreements, countries and companies exporting fish or fishery products to the EU will always have to comply with the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and with the EU’s health and food safety requirements. I believe that the Commission has considered the matter very carefully before bringing this measure forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall now turn to a broader issue: the EPA in general. Trade is far from simple. As I have said, the only way to eradicate poverty is to allow growth in the developing world. It is true that regional cooperation is rather difficult at the start. It is not just trade agreements that make regional development happen. That is why we have earmarked EUR 45 million for aid for trade in the Oceania region. This is three times more than was provided for under the ninth EDF. It is only by facilitating trade flows that you can expect regional trade to take place. If we look at all developing countries, basically all trade is based on monoculture – one particular export item with a high fluctuation rate. This has a highly disruptive effect in the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk about migratory flows, security, safety and justice in the world, we cannot just say that we do not care about it. We should care about it, and our departments have carried out an extensive study. We are proposing very decent measures which are completely in line with all the European Union’s objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the measure is right and that the necessary safeguards are in place in case anything goes wrong. I believe we have judged this correctly and I therefore lend my support to this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be brief. I find myself almost, indeed entirely, in agreement with the Commissioner on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, to repeat, it is important that we sign the interim EPA because, if we do not, existing trade preferences for Papua New Guinea and Fiji will disappear, under the WTO ruling. The interim EPA is precisely that: it is an interim arrangement, and I agree with all the colleagues who say that our objective in the long run should be a full, comprehensive EPA with all the Pacific countries, encouraging regional integration in the Pacific. But we have to take this step at the moment to ensure the continuation of preferences for the two largest countries in the Pacific region.</p>
      <p sl="en">On fishing, the Commission has made it very clear that what we have here is an exception. This will be the only derogation. There are no other parts of the world to which we intend giving such a derogation. Why are we giving a derogation to Papua New Guinea? I will tell you: it is because Papua New Guinea is literally on the other side of the world, and the likelihood of EU fishing fleets exploiting that area extensively is limited, although they are free to do so. There is nothing to stop EU fishing fleets fishing in Papua New Guinea waters and landing their catch and getting their catch canned in Papua New Guinea – and, as has been said earlier, that would be very good for development, and indeed we should encourage it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the situation at present is that Chinese boats, Thai boats and boats of other Asian nationalities are fishing in Papua New Guinea’s waters and landing their fish back in their own country, giving no opportunity for development in Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a development opportunity here in terms of providing jobs, particularly for women. We often complain that we do not do enough in our development policy to encourage downstream activity. Here, we are actually doing something positive for downstream activity. As the Commissioner has said, in order to qualify, the fish still needs to meet all the standards under the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It has to meet all our sanitary and phytosanitary conditions. That is absolutely essential. The three factories in Papua New Guinea meet these standards at the moment and are providing useful jobs. If we have a sudden increase in the number of factories, and a sudden surge in imports from Papua New Guinea, then, of course, we will have to revisit the situation and potentially take action.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the moment, however, the statistics speak for themselves. This agreement has been in place since 2008. There has been no surge. There is no threat to the European tuna industry. I have met, as rapporteur, with the leaders of the Spanish tuna industry and they themselves have said to me that there is no current threat. What they are worried about is the future. They accept that at the moment, there is no serious threat to the EU industry. So let us not exaggerate the situation. Let us not make a poor developing country pay for our preoccupation with our own self-interest.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Mrs Angelilli, on international adoption in the European Union (O-0193/2010 – B7-0670/2010).</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the years, many of my fellow Members and I have become aware of the problem of abandoned children, orphans and street children. Amongst the associations that contacted me was the Amici dell’adozione.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are many abandoned children, not only in the developing world, but also in Europe. These are children who become invisible and end up in the vicious circle of poverty and social exclusion or, worse still, are exploited by organised crime for begging, illegal work, prostitution, organ trafficking or illegal adoptions. Often, these children spend their youth shuttling between social workers and orphanages.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must guarantee these children the right to be adopted and the right to have a family. A child should spend as little time as possible in an institution. Obviously, the aim is the best interests of the child, so the ability to be adopted must certainly be granted warily, under the scrupulous supervision of the competent domestic authorities. However, where suitable conditions exist, children have the right to be adopted, above all at national level, but also at international level, within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">I know that the Commission is aware of this, even if it is a matter of purely national competence. However, some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions, but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or, as I said before, abandoned to an institution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for bringing forward this important question. The protection and promotion of children’s rights is a priority for the Commission, especially since the launch of the communication entitled ‘Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child’ in 2006. The strategy on the rights of the child focuses on the fundamental rights of children, including the protection of the best interests of the child as enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is determined to ensure that all fundamental rights encompassed in the Charter are duly respected by all EU actions, both legislative and non-legislative. This practice will be upheld and further developed in the forthcoming communication on the rights of the child that the Commission will be publishing this year. As of this year, 2011, the Commission will also be reporting annually on progress made on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to remember that the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States, only when they are implementing Union law. We therefore have to remember that, currently, no European Union legislation on international adoption exists. The subject is regulated by the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on protection of children and cooperation in respect of inter-country adoption, as well as by national laws. All the Member States are party to that Convention, but the EU is not. Its aim is to implement Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by establishing safeguards to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and that the child’s fundamental rights are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Internationally, the Commission supports the accession of third countries to the 1993 Hague Convention on inter-country adoption and its correct implementation by participating in relevant meetings of the contracting parties. The Commission does not consider specific European rules on intra-EU adoptions to be necessary, as all 27 EU Member States are parties to the Hague Convention. That being said, the Commission is closely following the issue of international adoption within the European Union, given the link between adoption and children’s rights. The Commission has taken steps to see how countries are implementing the convention on adoption, and, in November 2009, provided a forum for an exchange of views on the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s Green Paper on the free circulation of public documents, published on 14 December 2010, addresses the lack of mutual recognition of adoption decisions as civil status acts between Member States and its impact on the freedom of movement of EU citizens. This is a specific step which addresses the question raised today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the issue of international adoption is particularly important, and Mrs Angelilli has done well to bring it to the attention of the European Parliament in this sitting.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need leaner, simplified procedures. The current costs of adoption are particularly significant, ranging from EUR 20 000 to EUR 30 000 per adoption, and there are difficulties in providing a real response to the need for a family and for budding parents to become just that. We are talking about vulnerable and often abandoned children who sometimes disappear from sight. I am referring, in particular, to flows of illegal immigrants and the many children who, having been accommodated in immigration centres, are subjected to the disgraceful conditions of the slave trade, in which so many of them are often caught up.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to promote the family. The Italian model, and that of other places, can be followed. We need to cut the costs related to international adoption, provide favourable loans from banks, introduce those leaner, simplified procedures that I mentioned, with proper supervisory mechanisms for monitoring what is going on in the Member States, ensure real prevention of trafficking in human beings, on which Parliament recently intervened with a specific dossier, take real action to combat illegal adoptions, and ensure transparency.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is more, if we want to restore the central role of the family – as we often say in this Chamber – we must make sure that the associations, which are very often the key vehicle of these adoptions, are characterised by particularly high standards of guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would conclude, Commissioner Georgieva, by saying that if there is a suggestion to be made, then it is the following: why not provide a European system of accreditation for these associations, and ensure that they work transparently, clearly and practically, but with a high level of guarantees to truly protect the inalienable and inviolable rights of children?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, we are talking here this evening about a very sensitive topic, since we are talking about the smallest members of society, about those who need our love and need our care.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The problem of abandoned children is becoming more serious in Europe. The situation that has arisen today is, to a very large extent, due to immediate surroundings. Through the law on adopting children in an international context, it is possible to avoid a situation where many children are forced to live in children’s homes, where, despite the enormous care they receive, they never feel the real love of a mother or a father’s caress.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to make the adoption system more effective, so that the youngest abandoned children can find a replacement family. It is necessary, for example, to restrict the rights of biological parents who show no genuine interest in a child for a certain period of time. This would shorten the period which a child spends in a children’s home, as the child is not, so to speak, legally free. In this way, it would also be possible, to some extent, to eliminate unnecessary delays in the overall adoption process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Many agreements on the protection of minors provide a legal framework for the efforts of the competent authorities to act for the benefit and in the interests of these children. Protecting children’s rights is also one of the main aims of the European Union. It is therefore necessary to continue taking appropriate steps to ensure, in particular, that the best interests of children are protected under all circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli for this initiative and Commissioner Georgieva for her response. This is an important debate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Very many children throughout Europe today lack a home to call their own and a family to protect them and to keep these vulnerable little children warm and safe. This is a dream for those children who grow up in institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">All of us must now do our utmost to make sure that orphan or abandoned children do not have to grow up in children’s homes and other institutions, but in families where they will receive the affection that can carry them right through to their adult lives, so that they will become healthy, rather than damaged adults.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have differing views in our Member States about who can form a family. I nevertheless believe we could all agree that, although a family may look different, what is important is that the child receives love and care.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope that we will also be able to agree about the importance of cooperation on political strategies and instruments for international adoptions. I assume that the Commission will take the lead in this work. I am also looking forward to working together with my fellow Members to draw up a joint resolution on this matter. If we are able to help to bring together an abandoned orphan child and a family that is longing for children, we will have made a very important contribution.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must also remember how important it is that our smallest brothers and sisters are well treated. If we give them love, we will make life a little brighter on this planet. I believe that is something that all of us must do throughout our lives, regardless of our role in society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, adoption is a positive way of providing a new family for children who cannot be brought up by their birth parents, or children who lose their parents. To adopt a child in the UK, checks and vetting procedures are robust, and prospective parents need to be accepted by an adoption agency. The welfare of the child is, and should be, at the heart of the adoption process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of inter-country adoptions is more complex than national adoption, but I am very grateful to the PPE Group for bringing this issue forward. Whilst it is to be commended that we try and move forward in it, I have concerns that international adoption does bring risks – risks that have already been mentioned, such as child abuse and malpractice, that undermine the welfare of the child.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I believe that all Member States need to ensure that their adoption laws are regulated in a way that promotes the interests of the child. Member States must work together to ensure that the legal process of adoption between the providing and receiving countries is transparent, robust and holds the child’s welfare as its priority.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give the example of Bulgaria, where the problem of abandoned children is becoming increasingly serious and urgent measures are needed to resolve the situation. Systems like Bulgaria’s, which give a large percentage of children for international adoption are damaging.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Having said that, the childcare systems being what they are, international adoption may be the only opportunity many of the children in children’s homes have for a family and a normal life. When improving the overall system, we should be careful not to deprive them of that opportunity. We need measures which will not only make the international adoption procedure easier, but also guarantee our children’s interests, and that the so-called ‘adoptive parents’ are not just after European citizenship, which is something that is possible at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It should not be my job to ask whether they are doing it for altruistic reasons or for their own benefit. That is the job of those who conduct adoption interviews, who will have to look out for our children’s interests. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its underlying philosophy must be the basis for international adoption laws within the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="1-159-000" speaker_id="96814" name="Elena Băsescu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome the interest shown by my Italian fellow Members in the situation of abandoned children, an interest which we all actually share. Nevertheless, this issue comes under national jurisdiction only. I asked to take part in this debate as I come from a country which is being subjected to pressure to resume international adoptions and amend the legislation currently in force. However, in Romania, there are more families wishing to adopt than children available for adoption. Our legislation, which numerous international experts were also involved in drafting, is completely in line with European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Turning now to this resolution, I must say that the phrase ‘the right of the child to be adopted internationally’, as specified in point d, is not recognised by the UN and Hague conventions. International adoption is just one option. These children end up in the system due to the precarious situation in which the families they come from find themselves, which, according to international legislation and conventions, should not constitute grounds for adoption. This explains the large number of children in care homes. However, 22 966 children do have a parent. Romanian legislation provides for parental rights to be revoked only in the case of abuse. Therefore, these children are not eligible for adoption. This also applies to the 22 285 children in foster care. The rationale behind the resolution must be focused on the best interests of the child, as my fellow Members before me have also said, and not on those of the adopter. It is the duty of each state and not of anybody else to choose the most appropriate outcomes for its children.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I recommend that everyone becomes more familiar with national legislations. I am referring by this, for example, to a number of children’s courts in Italy which issued seven adoption judgments in 2009 relating to children from Romania, with complete disregard for our legislation.</p>

    <intervention id="1-160-000" speaker_id="39711" name="Victor Boştinaru" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome this debate during the European Parliament plenary session, starting with the assumption that the protection of children’s rights is and must be a priority for every Member State in our Union. The ultimate goal of everyone in this Chamber is to promote children’s interests.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It goes without saying that common, strict criteria implemented by Member States are required to improve the care and living conditions for children living in institutions and who have been abandoned and to ensure their protection when they are adopted, especially in the current climate, where budget austerity seems to be the only thought which the European Union’s right-wing governments have. Therefore, the first step is to provide appropriate care for these children. The second step is to combat child trafficking and prostitution. The third step is for us not to forget, for the children’s sake, that priority must be given to adoptions by family members and national adoptions. The fourth step is that only then should international adoptions be considered.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On this matter, we can but learn the lessons from the past, as opening the gates to international adoptions in Romania led to the creation of unprecedented child trafficking networks and cases involving children being abducted and sold to the West, in cooperation with European and international organisations. Between 1997 and 2000, Commissioner, Romania ‘exported’ 9 150 children. My country will never accept such an abomination again.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to ask, through your good self, for Commissioner Reding to explain the allegations which have appeared in the Romanian and international media concerning the European Agency for Monitoring International Adoptions, a proposal which also seems to feature in the study commissioned by the European Commission. A fellow Member is still waiting for Commissioner Reding’s reply to a question.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading. In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages. It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children. Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough. In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions. In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help. In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure. Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area. I welcome the Commissioner’s statements in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is a very important subject, but also a sensitive one. As you know, during the previous parliamentary term, we discussed the issue of the adoption of Romanian children by parents in Israel, and this caused serious problems, including of a political nature. Now we have another initiative. It is, I think, motivated by good intentions, but, as can be seen, it is causing a lot of emotion. I think we need to be very careful here not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so that in our concern for a good future life for children, we do not cause a situation in which we take a short cut and open the door to hasty adoptions and, in fact, allow children to be taken away from their parents. I would like to warn very strongly against this.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the topic of inter-country adoption and of abandoned children was included in the European Parliament’s agenda. I find it extremely important that high priority is given to child protection issues across the board, in the European Parliament as well as in the European Union. We must all set an example when it comes to abandoned and neglected children. They also have the right to grow up to become healthy adults, both in body and soul. To achieve this, it is imperative that these abandoned, neglected and orphaned children grow up in a family and in a healthy environment. We must do everything in our power to ensure that as few children as possible end up in orphanages. The issue of abandoned children becomes particularly relevant when we think of an ageing Europe where every child is also a keystone of our own future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your thorough answer. While we know that the Hague Convention essentially governs inter-country adoption, we also know that 26 of the 27 Member States are signatories to it. You are also correct when you say that how this international convention is implemented is a question of subsidiarity. At the same time, I feel that we cannot afford to be ambiguous. Life forces us to concern ourselves with the issue of children not only when scandals erupt or when it is discovered that a hundred children were sold here, or several hundred or more than a thousand children were sold there. The other side of the coin is that we must ensure that the thousands of children we know about in the European Union can be put up for adoption. This topic cannot be avoided because the European Union has a responsibility to protect children’s rights while, at the same time, we are also seeing that the issue of adoption and, as a matter of fact, as its direct consequence, international legislation and international practice, blow certain rights out of proportion, making the adoption of children impossible and thereby curtailing their other rights. Commissioner, I really would like to ask that we move forward as regards your comments in your introduction concerning the lack of an international law that could already exist in the European Union on accepting adoption documents in Member States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of inter-country adoption is at least as important as the issue of cross-border divorces and also deserves the same level of attention, particularly because it most often concerns children who are emotionally, financially and, in every other possible sense, at the mercy of decisions made by adults. These children deserve the highest degree of protection by the Community.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The interest of those who submitted verbal questions as regards the issue of inter-country adoption was concerned primarily with the legislative environment. The overview of the practice is at least as important as legislation. A new or even a good policy decision and a new legislative environment can be created only with access to reliable data and statistics, as well as actual practice. Establishing whether it is even necessary to touch the legislation is possible only by relying on precise data, which is why I consider the question posed by my fellow Members to be of key significance. However, because, in my opinion, the range of issues must be treated in a truly comprehensive manner, I would like to move a further step back than those who asked the question.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to ask the Commission the following questions: do we have accurate statistical data on inter-country adoption cases within the EU or involving third countries? Exactly what kind of data are we collecting about this topic? What methods do we use? Who is collecting the data, and if it is the Member States, do they use the same methodology? If an inter-country adoption takes place, whether within the EU or with the involvement of a third party, what is the process for the selection and preparation of children and parents? How do we supervise the preparation process? Do we have common rules for this? What are the differences in Member State practices? Is there an age limit as regards the child or the adoptive parent? Do adoptive parents receive continuous professional support? Is reliable and regular follow-up available? Do we know how often adoptive parents encounter problems and what these problems are? What kind of support do Member States provide in problematic cases? Thank you for your attention and thank you, Commissioner, for your outstanding work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania’s block on international adoptions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it. If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children – for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created – it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations. However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission’s position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, adoption can, and often does, work for the good of the child, but the procedures related to adoption can also give rise to abuses, such as the trafficking of children and taking children for adoption from families which have not abandoned their children at all, but which often, because of poverty, are not able to give their children the right environment. The high number of children in orphanages, which we are talking about in today’s debate, often does not mean children who have been abandoned, but in fact represents children of poor parents who are not coping with their difficult personal situation. Such families should be helped. State authorities could help these families for far lower sums without placing the children in an orphanage at all and without then giving them up for adoption. We should adopt an unequivocal principle – it should be obligatory in the European Union – never take children from their families because of poverty. Give help, and do not take children from their families. Poverty must not be the reason for depriving a child of its biological family.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs. This contradiction reveals some people’s genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested.</p>
      <p sl="it">The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union. The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption. On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature. However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing. The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union. This is the basis of today’s debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the oral question which has provided the basis for the resolution on international adoptions places an item of paramount importance on the European Parliament’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="ro">International adoption can only be considered as an alternative after all the measures for arranging a national adoption have been exhausted. International adoption also raises a series of specific issues and difficulties, largely arising from the limited interaction between a child and adoptive parents in the period prior to adoption, as well as from problems encountered by the child after adoption relating to linguistic and cultural adjustment. The principle of acting in the best interests of the child and not the adopter, as stipulated in the UN and Hague Conventions, must form the basis of the European Parliament’s resolution, with the focus on the child’s development in a family environment which ensures continuity in the child’s upbringing, taking into account the child’s ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The key consideration when examining the subject of adoptions and drafting the resolution is the principle of reintegrating the child from the protection system into a biological or extended family. I would like to highlight a confusion which is often made between the number of children who have been separated from their parents, but are in the care of the protection system, and the number of children available for adoption. Children separated from their parents enjoy protection from the state for a limited period of time and are not available for adoption. I think that we do not need control mechanisms and that the existing principles applied internationally which are linked to them are adequate.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question.</p>
      <p sl="it">From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem. There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children. However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless.</p>
      <p sl="it">Clearly, these children are our priority. They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires. However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders.</p>
      <p sl="it">All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children. I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt. However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years’ time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition.</p>

Either their own family or a replacement family, with a loving mother and father. Neither the European Union nor national borders must stand in the way of such a family. Although Member States have the final say in adoption issues, it is our duty to facilitate the process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must not forget, however, that efforts for the good of the child come first. This means efforts to help the child’s parents if they get into difficulties. The social situation of parents must not be a reason for deciding that their children should be adopted. It is simple to take a child away from impoverished parents, but at the same time, it is the worst thing we can do to a child. This applies twice over to international adoptions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As one of those who signed the question we put to the Commission on international adoptions, I am delighted that many Members are addressing this topic. I would be even more delighted if we could bring the same energy and sense of urgency to bear in attending to the good of families and their needs in all European policies.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="es">People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors. Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children’s Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I signed the oral question tabled by Mrs Angelilli because I think that the European Union cannot but make the protection of children one of its priorities, particularly in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, adoption procedures are only the litmus test of a social issue that we are duty bound to tackle and impose some boundaries upon. In the best cases, the children become objects of commercial exchanges that certainly offend our dignity, but unfortunately, they are often also victims of exploitation and violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Beyond the phenomenon of so-called ghost children – meaning those born illegally or abandoned and never picked up by the system – there is an undetermined number of children who can be adopted and who are matched by an equal number of couples hoping to adopt, who never cross paths due to legislative interpretation and cumbersome bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The United Nations Children’s Fund recently published a study containing some alarming figures, including with regard to many European countries. As Chair of the Committee on Petitions, I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the children alone.</p>
      <p sl="it">The complex procedures involved in many national systems do not always turn out to be beneficial for the child. The long timeframes involved are at odds with the need to have the child placed within the first year of his or her life to reduce the trauma of the upheaval and to avoid long stays in orphanages, and also because we should consider that above a certain age, there is lower market demand, unfortunately.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the light of these figures, I believe that the green light should be given to the long-heralded need for Europe-wide coordination of national laws which, firstly, will help simplify inter-European adoption procedures and, secondly, will guarantee that the fundamental principles of adoption are observed when children are adopted from third countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate Mrs Angelilli on the timeliness of this oral question. I am one of those that consider that we need to develop more effective child protection policies to prevent situations of poverty, abuse and child abandonment, along with alternatives to their confinement in institutions, among which adoption should play a key role.</p>
      <p sl="pt">UNICEF recognises that there has been no reduction in the number of children in institutions, and the increase in adoptions falls far short of the growth in the number of institutionalised children, a clear implication that we need to have a good, hard look at ourselves. It is vital that we carry out a general evaluation of the law and of administrative and legal practice regarding the existing adoption processes in the various Member States in order to identify anything that prevents them from working properly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Also, as regards non-EU countries, we need to monitor the problem of irregular or illegal adoption, which mainly occurs in the poorest regions. Take, for example, Guinea-Bissau, where more than 50% of children are not registered. This clearly facilitates the development of criminal activities by child trafficking networks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore believe that a European strategy for the protection of the children’s interests in the area of international adoption procedures is necessary in order to avoid and prevent abduction and the sale and trafficking of human beings.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in Ireland, the motto of the International Adoption Association is that families are made in many ways. The debate tonight reflects the interest that there is in adoption. There are over 1 200 members of that Association: many have adopted and some wish to adopt.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our attitudes to adoption have changed utterly. In Ireland, we come from a past where mothers – particularly single mothers – had their babies taken from them and given away to others to be adopted. That is not a good history, but it is certainly one that has now conditioned how we think of adoption: the child must be at the centre of it. Certainly, the birth families are very important in all of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, we have a duty and a responsibility to give the very best possible home to all our children. Each Member State – and that is the level on which this should operate – needs to protect children within its own borders. Europe should provide a coordinating role.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that in Ireland, we will have a referendum on the rights of the child. We talk about it a lot, but we are not so effective in actually dealing with it. I am hopeful that the referendum will happen. The situation will certainly improve then. This has been a really useful debate and I thank colleagues for it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the greatest gift that we can give to any child is that of a happy home. Most children find that in their own home with their natural parents. Many though, get this with their adoptive parents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Either is preferable to an institutional life, provided, of course, that there is no corruption or exploitation involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">To find the balance is very difficult, but I think that we need – while taking into consideration the Hague Convention, etc. – where there are prospective adoptive parents who are bona fide and beyond reproach, to facilitate them more in giving the gift of a happy home to a child who has not otherwise got one, and not encumbering them with lengthy, expensive, drawn-out processes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Angelilli, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the protection and care of children has become one of the fundamental rights that Europe is legally bound to protect. Even so, there are still too many cases in Europe of children being abandoned who, in the best scenario, end up in orphanages. This is a tragic situation which our democracies cannot tolerate.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why we need to make all the efforts required to prevent this situation from becoming unmanageable, adopting a strategy to raise the level of awareness and favouring the right to adopt children at international level as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">To make this happen, we first of all need an accurate picture of the situation in all the Member States, with constant monitoring which could also be carried out by creating a permanent observatory on children’s rights. In addition, we need a comprehensive overview of the existing measures taken by the European Union and those that could be developed to protect children in need of adoption by European citizens as much as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the wide range of instruments which currently govern international adoptions has led to confusion over whose role it is to safeguard the rights of children subject to international adoptions. The Commission needs to focus further on the competent authorities, and ensure that those regulating the adopters’ and the adopted children’s rights are making sure that basic minimum standards are adhered to, and that, in the longer term, the child is able to maintain a link to its birth country and its culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically, urgent measures must be taken to react to the abuse and trafficking of children, which, as a report in my own country today shows, is alarmingly on the rise both within and across European borders. Child trafficking and child laundering – the stealing of children who are subsequently sold to adoptive parents as legitimate orphans – is a phenomenon which does not receive adequate attention at an international level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would call on the Commission to play a more active role in the field of international adoption, to take concrete steps to improve the convoluted and confused legislative framework which currently governs international adoption in the EU, and to protect those most vulnerable young people.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, we are talking at this moment about international adoptions because there are children in every country who, for various reasons, cannot be placed in functioning families or in replacement families in the same country.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is not acceptable to have a repeat of the situation we witnessed in the recent past when a more affluent country such as Italy enjoyed greater opportunities to adopt children from the less affluent Romania. Surely, as a number of Members have already said this evening, poverty cannot be a sufficient reason for taking a child away from the family and allowing an international adoption.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to emphasise strongly that we must take great care in this situation to uphold not only national laws but also international laws, in order to prevent the risk of abuse, trafficking and the abduction of children.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The liberalisation of international adoption entails numerous risks. On the one hand, it increases the possibility of child trafficking and abuse caused as a result of financial interests and difficulties in monitoring the situation after adoption takes place. On the other hand, separating children from their biological parents and place of origin can have adverse psychological, social and educational repercussions. When we discuss adoption, our main consideration must be to safeguard the child’s welfare. Therefore, pressure must not be exerted on EU Member States with diverse traditions and legal procedures relating to adoption to liberalise international adoption.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In addition, the monitoring of children adopted via the international adoption procedure must be carried out by the national institution with the relevant powers.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I just wanted to add something about kinship care, and support to kinship carers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most kinship carers are grandparents and find themselves being the main caregivers for their grandchildren, normally because the parent either has a drug addiction or has died through that drug addiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue I wanted to bring to this House’s attention is the good work that Mentor UK has been doing on the rights of kinship carers. Some kinship carers adopt their grandchildren. Others do not, but are in a caring relationship with that child and provide a stable and safe home for them. However, the rights of kinship children are often actually less than those of children who are in proper care. This is something which I felt people had touched upon in this debate, but I would urge you, if you are interested in the issue of kinship carers, to look at the work of Mentor UK and the help that is given to kinship carers in different countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first echo the sentiments of those who expressed thanks to Ms Angelilli for initiating a very rich debate this evening. I have five points to make in summing up the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the Commission fully agrees with the views that have been expressed on the importance of protecting and promoting the rights of children in inter-country adoptions. This is, and will remain, the main objective of the Commission as we participate in discussions on this topic, both in the context of the Hague Convention and in our work on the rights of children in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this issue, I would point out that in the forthcoming communication on children’s rights, we will present actions to promote the rights of the child for the period between 2011 and 2014. These will include actions aimed at improving the support the Commission provides to Member States in the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As I mentioned with reference to the Green Paper, we are also taking steps that will facilitate the circulation of civil status acts as adoption decisions – in other words, the mutual recognition of national adoption decisions within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to MEPs’ concerns that the issue is sensitive and should be seen in the context of national needs and national legislation, the Commission would like to underline that the Romanian law on international adoptions is the sole responsibility of the Romanian Government. The measure that has been taken must be seen in connection with the abusive practices in inter-country adoption in Romania in the past. The Commission is closely following developments in Romanian legislation, but I would like to stress again that it is Romania’s sole responsibility to further develop this law.</p>
      <p sl="en">On monitoring, it is our strong belief that the appropriate institution is the Special Commission of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption. The Commission participates in that monitoring body. We will take many of the points that have been made this evening into account when we think about how we participate in the work of this body.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers accreditation to be a matter of national authority. It relates to family laws that Member States have and develop, and therefore it is appropriate that it should be addressed at that level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I will convey to Vice-President Reding the points that have been made here this evening, including the question raised by one Member in relation to which an answer is expected.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the godmother of an adopted boy, I have seen how emotional and difficult the issue of adoption can be, and how many factors are involved in a decision to adopt. I have listened to the debate this evening not only with great interest, but also with a sense that it is a matter not just of legislation, but also of hearts and minds. Therefore, let us pray that hearts and minds are brought into play in a way that best protects the interests of children, both our children and children in other countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">The resolution being discussed is basically stating the fundamental principles of the rights of children to be adopted and safeguards for their welfare. It is deficient in putting forward concrete proposals to make the adoption procedures more efficient and less bureaucratic, without compromising on the safeguards. There are thousands of orphaned or abandoned children who live in substandard conditions. There are thousands of childless couples who could give a future to these children. It is not enough to call on EU institutions to play an active role at the Hague conference to exert pressure to improve, streamline and facilitate international adoption procedures. It would be more meaningful if concrete proposals are made on how to streamline and facilitate international adoption procedures. It may be admirable if the issue of international adoptions is seen within the wider context of adoption itself. National governments need to legislate so as to give a fresh impetus to the relevant laws and enable the adoption of children who have been abandoned by their parents. In many legislations, the assent of the biological parents is still necessary, even if these have completely abandoned their children.</p>

      <p sl="de">Children are among those in our society who are most in need of protection, particularly if they are orphans, vulnerable or abused children. In the case of international adoptions, children who are taken away from the environment that they are used to often suffer a huge amount of damage as a result. Therefore, the welfare of the child must always take priority. That is something that the United Nations also needs to take into account. Last year, a campaign was launched in Mexico City on subway tickets aimed at promoting the right of homosexual couples to adopt. According to media reports, this campaign was supported by the United Nations, even though psychologists confirm that growing up with a father AND a mother as role models is of key importance for a child’s development. Stable family relationships are especially important in the case of adopted children who, as such, have already not had the best start in life. There can be difficulties in any partnership, but, for the sake of the welfare of the children, we should not make problems a foregone conclusion right from the start.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am very pleased that the European Parliament is looking at the question of adoption in the Union today, because this is something which is especially dear to me. The particular references to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union make it possible for us to take up this question, and they also oblige us to do so. International adoption can mean the chance of a normal life and a happy family for many abandoned children who, because of their age or health, have no chance of being adopted in their own country. In Europe today, we are facing a situation in which in countries where abortion has been accepted and is widely available, there are not many children for adoption, while in other countries, there are many such children, and apart from the youngest of them, they have no chance of finding a family of their own. Furthermore, there is a growing number of couples who find it difficult to have their own children or who are affected by fertility problems which cannot be treated. So I am very enthusiastic about the work of the European Commission in this area. The Member States should come to an agreement on the question of simplifying procedures so that they will not be too complicated or protracted. We must not, however, forget to put in place systems for protection and monitoring, in order to prevent child trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it is now 19 months since Canada suddenly and unilaterally introduced visa requirements for citizens of the Czech Republic, which, as a Member of the EU, is not allowed to introduce a reciprocal visa requirement for all Canadians. President Barroso immediately stated that it was a Union and not a bilateral issue, but Commissioner Malmström is unfortunately not addressing it as a priority, but only passively monitoring the bilateral negotiations. In response to my intervention, the Council said that the Union is not discussing reciprocity, as it has not yet received any proposals from the Commissioner. Czech citizens are thus de facto second class citizens of the EU as far as their rights are concerned, and it is surprising that Canadians continue to travel to the Czech Republic without visas.</p>

It has no other option for defending the rights of its citizens, since the EU is failing to put pressure on Canada. I would therefore like to demand, together with you, that the Commissioner deals with Canada without delay, and also stands up for Romania and Bulgaria.

      <p sl="en">The so-called authorities, supported by Turkey, had stopped the Saturday service on the pretext that no application had been made to hold the mass that day, although according to the Church of Cyprus, such permission was requested at the beginning of December, as has been the case for the last 36 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I strongly encourage you to take the appropriate steps to guarantee religious freedom on the soil of a European Union Member State.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on Christmas Day, the Turkish Security forces in Rizokarpaso, in the occupied part of Cyprus, interrupted by force the Christmas mass being celebrated by the few remaining – elderly – Christians there, evicted the priests from the church and ordered the congregation to leave. The excuse was that they had been given written permission for Sunday mass, but that Christmas was on a Saturday.</p>
      <p sl="en">Demanding written permission for mass is a restriction of the freedom of religion in itself, let alone to interrupt a Christmas Day mass on the grounds of a petty bureaucratic excuse – all this in a Member State of the Union, by ordinance of a country aspiring to join it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the Vienna Agreement, 12 000 Greek Cypriots enclaved in the Karpass Peninsula were allowed to live there after the Turkish invasion. Today there are 300. Now you understand why.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I believe it would be extremely worthwhile for the EU to start an inter-faith dialogue from the highest level. I would like to see the EU attempt to get Turkey to host such a dialogue. We all know how Christians are treated throughout the world – in various different places in the Middle East, the Copts in Egypt, Christian Iraqis in Iraq and so on. It is my firm view that we cannot simply report on this and hear about it and watch it happening; we must do something tangible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The first thing we need to do as far as I can see is to establish a dialogue. It would be very worthwhile if Turkey, with the bridge-building spirit that I believe exists there, in spite of everything, was able to host this type of dialogue. This is about Jews, Christians and Muslims. Let us establish a broad inter-faith dialogue under the auspices of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in Iraq and in Egypt, the Christians say that they are truly suffering. Soon, ladies and gentlemen, there will no longer be any Christians on the lands that gave birth to Christianity. As was said a few moments ago, in Turkey, a secular Muslim country and a country which is knocking at our door, 20% of the population were Christian 100 years ago; today, the figure is less than 1%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The movement which we are witnessing is, in fact, a groundswell. The Arab and Muslim world is persecuting its Christians, condemning them, preventing them from converting, punishing them and killing them. We are clearly seeing Islam becoming a state religion. The result is there for everyone to see – Christianity is the most persecuted religion in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, ladies and gentlemen, defending Christians in the Middle East increases the chances of counterbalancing the rise of Islamic extremism. The presence of Christians everywhere is a balancing factor. Therefore, we really must defend it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I genuinely wonder, ladies and gentlemen, where the human rights defenders have gone who are happy, as we are, that the West is secular and pluralist, and who shamefully avert their gaze before a Middle East that, little by little, is being reserved for a single religion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Government decided, at the close of 2010, to stop subsidising the institute for young children established in Budapest by Emmi Pikler.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This Hungarian scientist created the centre to develop scientifically-based teaching methods for very young children. The effectiveness of these methods for the psychomotor development of children has been internationally recognised. Institutions for young children based on this model have proliferated across Europe, including in my own city in Belgium.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a shame that, at the end of the European Year for Combating Poverty – in particular, child poverty – Hungary is sending out this kind of signal. This decision is surprising given the international influence of the Pikler Institute and the fact that the Hungarian administrative authorities have said that they want it to keep going. I therefore wonder, although I am not biased in any way, about the motives behind this decision by the Hungarian Government.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I do not need to remind you about the horrible acts that have been perpetrated recently. I would like to say again quite solemnly that defending Christians in the Middle East and across the world, and calling for religious freedom and diversity of beliefs, means calling for freedom, democracy and human rights, which are values at the heart of the European project, and which are also, of course, universal values – or at least, all of us here believe so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is really time now to move beyond indignation, emotion and solemn condemnations; to move from words to action. I therefore urge the European Union authorities – the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, but also all our leaders and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs – to take specific measures and introduce a specific and concrete action plan to make respect for religious diversity and the fight against all forms of religious persecution a priority.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until last May, a coalition of socialists and liberals had been in power in Hungary for eight years. Throughout those eight years, democracy continued to grow weaker, human rights violations became endemic, and the freedom of the press was increasingly curtailed. Neither the European socialists nor the European liberals had anything to say about this. Last May a sweeping majority of Hungarian citizens voted against this social-liberal government and, in a landslide election unprecedented in Europe, voted into power a Fidesz-Social Democrat government. At the end of last year, this government adopted a new media law that guarantees freedom of the press. These are the circumstances under which Hungary and the Hungarian Government currently holding the EU Presidency are being fiercely attacked. This double standard cannot be reconciled with European values and we must speak out against it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, three years ago, the Schengen area expanded to include new member countries. Restrictive measures are still in place, however, on the borders between old and new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For example, on the border crossing of Rusovce – Kittsee, which is a highway crossing between Slovakia and Austria, the Austrians are imposing a tough speed limit of 30 km/h. At the same time, the crossing is still narrowed dramatically by a concrete barrier.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is by no means exceptional for regular speed checks to be imposed on passing vehicles at this border, as well as frequent police checks on documents and vehicle luggage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Schengen membership surely means the free movement of people and goods. A person should notice that he is crossing an EU Member State border only from a standard information board. The previously mentioned behaviour, which does not only apply to Austria, is a violation of the Schengen rules, and the European Commission should mount a principled response to it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, previous speakers have talked about discrimination against Christians. I, too, would like to talk about a certain form of deprecation of some countries in Europe. Over the past couple of weeks, at the outset of the Hungarian Presidency, a great many critical words have been said about the Hungarians, and very often these words have been unfounded and unjustified. Unfortunately, besides the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, other words, which were also very unfair and which were, I think, offensive to the Hungarians, have come from the mouths of politicians of this House, including from Mr Schulz. I think this is a symptom of a certain belief that the Member States of the European Union are divided into categories of ‘better’ and ‘worse’. The better ones are those which have been here for a long time now, and the worse ones are those which have only been here since 2004.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that this kind of discrimination should end, and that everyone needs to get used to the fact that the new Member States are full members of the European Union – this is necessary particularly in this Chamber. Therefore, I would ask that those people in this Chamber who permit themselves to indulge in this type of discrimination should be disciplined and punished.</p>

It fills me with pride that this Central European Member State is the third amongst the 2004 accession states to have the opportunity to carry out this honourable and responsible mission. There is no doubt that Hungary has always been on the frontline in the fight for democracy. Who would ever question 1956, 1989 or the autumn of 2006? This is why I am extremely shocked by the negative campaign launched by certain political forces against the current EU President, including under the pretence of the Hungarian media law. It is completely obvious that this is not a question of legislation but of an attack by political losers. They are the ones who are attempting to corrode the unified European spirit. As for the map of Hungary depicted on the cultural history carpet, I would just like to say that those who cannot face history cannot see clearly the future either. Just as the people of France, Germany or Poland can speak about their nations’ past, so can those of Hungary. I consider it an irresponsible and dangerous act to discredit our presiding country, particularly at a time when the need for the closest collaboration is greater than ever.</p>

      <p sl="el">Greece therefore faces a massive crisis as far as this issue is concerned. The Greek Government recently announced its intention to build a fence along our land border with Turkey. One asks oneself if such a solution suffices as a strategy to help to resolve the problem. Of course, it does not. However many fences we put up, whatever efforts we make, we need a global strategy and solidarity between the European states. If we are to get off on the right foot, the first thing we need to do is to establish solid cooperation on these issues with Turkey, as the basic country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are still waiting for an EU-Turkey agreement to be signed. As we all know, it takes eighteen months to two years to achieve and then apply an agreement; until then, therefore, let us apply the bilateral agreement which has existed with Greece since 2002, as other countries in the south have done to resolve the problem.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin.</p>
      <p sl="it">The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers’ fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours’ work on an assembly line. The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="it">This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party. The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes. As a result of this agreement, workers’ rights in Italy have slipped back several decades. Europe should know this and bear it in mind.</p>

The same was said about granting Kazakhstan the chair of the OSCE in 2010 and holding a major OSCE summit in Astana in December.

      <p sl="hu">extraordinary meeting of the Commission. The topic could not have been anything other than the Hungarian media law. I could not believe my ears when influential socialist and liberal fellow Members demanded that the EU launch so-called serious infringement proceedings – the most severe of available sanctions – against Hungary, the holder of the current EU Presidency. Neither this, nor any other type of sanction, had been imposed between 2002 and 2010 when the socialist and liberal regime in Hungary violently broke up every single protest, summarily imprisoned hundreds of people, fired bullets into people’s eyes and caused severe injuries. If, after all this, the European Union launches infringement proceedings against the current Hungarian Government and state, it will finally open the eyes of those who have ever had any illusions concerning the European Union’s attitude towards Hungary, and I believe that the Hungarian nation will demand our secession from the European Union, and there will be some who will follow our example.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Food Supplements Directive was adopted in 2002 but, almost nine years later, it has still not been fully implemented. The Commission has yet to produce a proposal to harmonise the maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals that can be included in food supplements as required by the directive. This failure means that companies have to produce multiple product formulations to comply with different national laws. This is unfair and expensive, especially as a scientific model for setting maximum amounts is available. The Commission itself cited this in a paper in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">It begs the question of why the proposal has not been produced? Perhaps, to paraphrase Robbie Burns, whom somebody mentioned a minute ago, ‘The best laid plans of mice and men and the Commission gang aft agley’.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bulgarian public has recently witnessed a series of publications about the use of special surveillance equipment to eavesdrop on people in high government positions. Who divulged this information, where it came from, and whether it is true remains unknown, and nobody has taken responsibility for publicising it.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The government’s clearly stated desire for reform and the fight against organised crime, its unwillingness to be influenced by the former State Security Service, and the fact that this year, Bulgaria will be holding presidential and local elections, were the trigger for this campaign, which created tension and sowed mistrust in those in power.

However, there is another aspect to this problem: eavesdropping is becoming an obsession among some politicians and the upper ranks of the current special services.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There has been no improvement in the effectiveness of the fight against crime. The burgeoning paranoia about the use of such eavesdropping is even more unacceptable. Who the instigators of this bacchanalia are is not clear: whether they are figures from the security sector or their former colleagues, or underground structures whose aim is to destabilise the situation. The contents of recorded conversations mysteriously circulate in the media. The Bulgarian Prime Minister also figured in one of the recorded conversations. The contents were discrediting, but he claims it was manipulated.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid: the mid-term review of its Action Plan and the way forward [2010/2101(INI)].</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the global humanitarian context has got worse; the humanitarian challenges and needs are immense, and there are now countless areas in which intervention is required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid is a fundamental instrument which is as relevant as ever in this massively changing humanitarian context. By strictly applying the Consensus and its associated action plan, we can respond to humanitarian challenges. However, the humanitarian partners apart, too many people are still unaware of the Consensus. We should therefore make an effort to increase its visibility and to raise its profile among the Member States and the actors involved. We must ask for this Consensus to be distributed, understood and applied within the European External Action Service and by military personnel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2009, the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid was established within the Council. It has become an important forum, but its role should be strengthened in terms of coordination between Member States and the monitoring of the implementation of the Consensus, and in terms of advocating humanitarian aid in relation to the other working parties of the Political and Security Committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The mid-term review of the action plan is a unique opportunity to strengthen action in areas deserving more attention, such as, firstly, the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law, because humanitarian aid is not a crisis management instrument, and we should deplore the increasing politicisation of humanitarian aid and its consequences in terms of respect for the ‘humanitarian space’. A second area concerns the issues of quality, coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid, and a third aspect is the clarification of the use of military and civil protection capabilities in conformity with the Humanitarian Consensus and United Nations guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A very clear distinction needs to be maintained between the remits of military and humanitarian bodies, and a dialogue between military and humanitarian bodies is necessary in order to encourage mutual understanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, in my report, I invite the European Commission to present some very ambitious legislative proposals for the creation of a European protection force, and I am pleased at the recent communication by the Commission on strengthening the European Union’s disaster response capabilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we must strengthen the ‘disaster risk reduction’ dimension and the link between emergency aid, reconstruction and development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Treaty of Lisbon established the European External Action Service. We have therefore endeavoured, in the course of negotiations, to defend the independence of DG ECHO and to prevent any attempts to use humanitarian aid for foreign policy purposes. Strict and transparent rules on cooperation and coordination between the European External Action Service and the Commission in the management of large-scale crises must be introduced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To finish, I would like to draw your attention to the proliferation of sexual violence – I am thinking in particular of the East of the Republic of the Congo, of the Kivu region – and to the importance of systematically integrating gender and reproductive health into the emergency healthcare aspect of the humanitarian response.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Striffler on her report. However, it fails to mention actors whose involvement is based on religion, particularly Christianity. The text of the European Consensus does mention the Red Cross, but it ignores other actors that have the same status in international law but which are based on Christianity, such as, for example, the Order of Malta.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report thus provides new evidence of the disregard with which the European institutions greet the involvement of Christian actors in humanitarian intervention. Religions have not just the obligation, but also the competence necessary to intervene rapidly in crisis and natural disaster situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I invite the rapporteur to table an oral amendment to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of actors who base their work on the Christian faith.</p>

The report also points out specific weak points in the system, however, and other obstacles preventing the effective and rapid movement of humanitarian goods and services for the most vulnerable people in crisis areas.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I hope that the Treaty of Lisbon, which brings a whole series of innovations in the area of EU humanitarian aid, and which is now a separate policy area, will be appropriately and promptly used to achieve tangible results in accordance with respect for human dignity, human values and adherence to human rights, as established in international law, including, for example, rapid assistance in disasters.</p>

I also consider it an urgent matter, of course, to improve the safety of humanitarian workers. In my opinion, the Commission should also assign resources for disseminating information, especially in Haiti, so that the inhabitants affected can understand the causes and resulting circumstances of their disaster, and help protect the safety of humanitarian workers, instead of the opposite being the case. Otherwise, it will be necessary – and not in the least undesirable – to employ the protection of the armed forces.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should briefly like to ask some questions. Regarding the European Union, I know that we are wonderful for donating aid to where it is needed, but it often goes through NGOs. Are there any NGOs that have not been up to scratch, or that have been the subject of complaints in the countries in which they operate, or that the European Union itself might have reservations about? In other words, do we just give the aid and the supplements – let us put it that way – to the NGOs annually? Where is the accountability?</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of some programmes I have seen recently, I was rather concerned about allegations being made as to what some of the NGOs were doing and their lack of accountability. Having said that, I know that the vast majority are doing good work and are properly motivated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we are able to discuss this problem here in this House today. I have two further comments or questions that always concern me when it comes to humanitarian aid. Firstly, it is clearly indisputable and important that we should provide assistance if people are in need, but – as the previous speaker has already said – we must always ask the question: will these funds actually be used properly and appropriately?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there is something else that we must not ignore. It is right to provide humanitarian aid for people in need. This could be a result of a natural disaster, but it is increasingly also a result of disasters that have been caused by people themselves. This includes, in particular, political or armed conflicts. We need to bear in mind that, although humanitarian aid provides emergency relief, at the same time, we must also eliminate the causes, namely, the political acts of violence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much welcome Mrs Striffler’s report, as well as Parliament’s involvement in and continued strong advocacy for effective European humanitarian action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The consensus was adopted in 2007. It provides an essential common policy framework for the EU – a common vision accompanied by an action plan. Both the Member States and the Commission have a shared responsibility to make sure that the consensus is well implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to stress that what comes very clearly out of the report is the message that humanitarian principles, international humanitarian law and protection of the humanitarian space have to be at the centre of our action on the consensus. Four-fifths of our humanitarian aid goes to people in need in conflict-related, man-made emergencies. For us to be able to reach these people, it is critical that our aid is independent and neutral and that it is perceived in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to give you one example of this. I have just come back from Yemen where, together with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Gutierrez, we engaged on the humanitarian access issue with high-level government officials and representatives of the al-Houthi rebel movement. For the first time, we obtained a commitment on their part to facilitate humanitarian access and respect delivery of aid to all Yemeni people in need, in line with the humanitarian principles of neutrality and independence. Having spent a number of hours with men with Kalashnikovs, I would like to observe that we in Europe do bring this value of neutrality that is a bridge to people in need. In the Yemeni case, there are 300 000 internally displaced people and many more hundred thousands affected by six wars in six years in the north of Yemen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, for a long-lasting impact, humanitarian aid is not the right instrument. It is development that can lay the foundation for lasting peace. We in the Commission have completed a year-long review process of the European consensus action plan, in close liaison with our Member State and humanitarian partners. On 8 December, the Commission adopted a Communication on this. The review shows that over the past three years, we have made significant contributions to strengthening the humanitarian response in terms of advocacy and humanitarian action, as well as by bringing humanitarian aid and civil protection together.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also concluded that there is scope for further improvement in three areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to promote the quality and effectiveness of aid by good assessment, a well-coordinated response and investment in disaster risk reduction and local capacity. At a time when needs are growing and budgets are constrained, this is critical.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just respond here to the question of accountability. Obviously, we need to stretch every euro to the full and deliver it with the highest possible quality and in the most effective way. In order to ensure that our partners – UN agencies and NGOs – are accountable, we review one-third of all partners and one-third of all projects every year. We have our own humanitarian aid offices in all the hotspot areas of the planet to be the ears and the eyes of our taxpayers, including in Yemen, because of increasing humanitarian needs. I recently cut the ribbon of our humanitarian aid office there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue concerning which we can see room for improvement is the strengthening of the European voice. We are the largest donor and have to make sure that we speak very clearly with one voice. We must also reach out to other donors so that we play our leadership role, vis-à-vis traditional donors, but also by engaging new donors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we need to ensure coherence which means working, together with the External Action Service, with military actors to make sure that a principled humanitarian approach is safeguarded and is also promoted in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by once again thanking Mrs Striffler for her work on this issue and calling upon Parliament to continue the discussion on this topic. The world has changed. Unfortunately, there will be more and more natural and man-made disasters. Whatever action we take will determine not only the lives of the people affected, but also the moral standing and the capacity of the EU to lead in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Humanitarian aid is an expression of universal human solidarity and is our moral obligation. Today, we are seeing a systematic growth in the need for humanitarian aid because of the growing number of natural disasters being brought to our attention. This is due in part to climate change, but is also due to the development of technology which enables us to realise that a catastrophe has occurred and to communicate the fact of its occurrence. Important criteria for the provision of humanitarian aid should be speed, responsibility and administrative costs which are as low as possible. The development of transport is a factor which facilitates the delivery of aid. This means that we can reach the victims faster and give aid to a greater number of people. This is why getting businesses involved is so important. I am thinking of corporations and concerns, but also of small enterprises, and not only those operating in the field of transport and logistics. We need to build networks of entities which work together in a particular geographical area, in order to be effective in delivering aid and to improve the system of rapid reaction to impending crises. On the basis of inter-sectoral partnerships between businesses, organisations and institutions, it would be possible to set up bases, special units and offices with funds, storage space, volunteers, food, essential materials and equipment and means of transport. Cooperation of this kind can bring measurable benefits in the face of human tragedy, particularly when it is necessary to react quickly and not to first have to start by collecting money.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Sârbu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security [2010/2112(INI)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-232-000" speaker_id="33989" name="Daciana Octavia Sârbu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, it is an honour for me to present my report to you, which deals with the strategic importance of agriculture in ensuring the European Union’s food security. Agriculture is a neglected topic in the discussions about the European Union’s strategy and future. This report will show that Europe has not achieved food security, that farmers and whole rural areas are in danger of disappearing, and that new challenges, such as climate change, are likely to destabilise already dwindling food stocks, not only in Europe, but also worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against a background where food production needs to increase by a minimum of 70% by 2050 in order to meet the world population’s food demands, food security must be the topic at the heart of the debates conducted at both global and European level. The European Union must respond robustly to these challenges and this report is our attempt to propose today a number of specific courses of action.</p>
      <p sl="ro">First of all, we need a strong common agricultural policy aimed at guaranteeing food security for as many EU citizens as possible and also at helping ensure global food security in the context of limited resources and the impact from climate change. We cannot talk about food security if we do not tackle two crucial issues, specifically: market and price volatility and dwindling global food stocks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the subject of price volatility, I have called on the Commission, as part of the new CAP, to enhance the role of market intervention instruments and adopt more consistent measures for restricting speculation on agricultural markets. Global food stocks are much more restricted nowadays than in the past. According to estimates, they can cover the world’s food requirements for just a month and a half. This is why I thought that the creation of a global food stock system would be beneficial, comprising both emergency stocks to reduce hunger and stocks to be used to regulate prices on agricultural markets, which comes under the international aegis and is supported by the expertise of existing institutions such as the UN or FAO. I believe that the European Union must initiate this action, which is why I have asked the Commission to take on this role.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another important issue touched on in this report is the situation of young farmers. If we are reflecting on the future of European agriculture, we must focus more attention on young farmers. Just 7% of farmers across Europe are under the age of 35. This is why I have asked the Commission for measures to be provided to encourage them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I have stressed the need to preserve European agriculture’s diversity. In this regard, I mentioned that traditional agricultural practices, family farming, small-scale farms and organic farming can make a valuable contribution to food security. I also called for the development of EU-level programmes to support these forms of agriculture. However, we must not forget that poverty and hunger persist in the European Union and that millions of Europeans have requested food aid from the EU this winter. Consequently, in the current economic crisis, it is of paramount importance to use EU funding to maintain the EU’s ‘Food Aid for the Most Deprived Persons’ programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and my other colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their good cooperation and the contributions they made to the drafting of this report, as well as the Secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt together a report which meets European citizens’ expectations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sârbu, our rapporteur, for the excellent work she has done on this report and for her cooperation with all the shadows. This follows work which I carried out in the previous mandate on the role of the common agricultural policy and global food security.</p>
      <p sl="en">I regret that we are debating this report just before midnight. Perhaps it will be at a minute to midnight that Europe and the world wake up to the realities of how insecure we are when it comes to food production.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is extremely welcome in our overall debate on this issue and in the context of our debate on reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had some concerns, but I think they are reflected in the final text. The idea that one form of production system is better than another – that organic, small, local is better – is not a good argument. We need all production systems to contribute to our food security. We do need to address market volatility and speculation and I do not think we have all the answers yet.</p>
      <p sl="en">The single key problem with agriculture is low incomes for farmers. Young farmers will not work for nothing, and we have to address the low income problem if we want security of food supply.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, due to constant population growth, we are obliged to adopt a more intensive approach to the issue of food security, and access to an adequate, healthy and nutritious diet.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In order to ensure food security, it is essential to increase transparency and fairness in the actual food chain, so that we can secure a fair return for farmers, with profits and price controls, and a viable agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, it is extremely important to apply a resolute policy on rural development, by means of which we can maintain the viability of rural Europe and boost the competitiveness of agriculture, support innovation and, ultimately, employment as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Agriculture is enormously important, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and it is therefore necessary to adopt stimulus measures to support agriculture in rural areas, attract more young people into agriculture, and help to reduce regional differences and secure sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to my colleague, Mrs Sârbu, on the excellent job done on the report. I strongly recommend that the Commission take it into consideration, particularly in those aspects in which the complex dimension of agricultural issues – which extend well beyond the narrow boundaries of agriculture itself – requires the involvement of other areas, such as competition on the internal market and financial regulation, and merits attention on stages outside the EU, such as the G20 or the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
      <p sl="pt">The crucial determining issues for agriculture, for farmers, and for supplying sufficient good quality food to the people of Europe and the rest of the world, can only be tackled in reality if they are considered from all angles. The ambitious objectives of common agricultural policy reform can only be achieved if the reforms extend beyond the narrow boundaries of agriculture and if the objectives are also taken into account in the action required in other policy areas and in other global bodies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Sârbu for an excellent report, which I consider to be one of the most important in this parliamentary term.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There are increasing numbers of people in the world, while the amount of arable land available is falling. Food is becoming, to an ever greater degree, a strategic product. While crude oil can be replaced by solar or nuclear energy, there is nothing which can replace the food our planet produces. In the European Union, we sometimes behave as if we were continually struggling with the problem of overproduction of food. The entire agricultural policy of the European Union in recent years has been based on ways of limiting and reducing agricultural production. We can already see on the horizon, today, that the time is coming when there will be a shortage of food. It is very good that this signal, in the form of the Sârbu report, has come from Parliament, saying that the situation has changed and that the European Union’s agricultural policy has to change, too. We must respect agriculture – it is the guarantee of our food security.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-237-000" speaker_id="96772" name="Peter Jahr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is the case in politics as it is in daily life: we do not fully appreciate what we have. Thus, it also clearly seems to be the case that we in the European Union have an excess of food, and there is, of course, always plenty to buy. If we compensate for animal feed exports, we have in the European Union a self-sufficiency rate of 88%. That means that, in the European Union, we, too, must endeavour to ensure that we maintain this self-sufficiency rate in terms of agricultural products and foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Sârbu, for bringing this problem into the spotlight once again. In the European Union, we also need a common agricultural policy that can supply our citizens with sufficient food. In view of the increasing global population, the effects of climate change and increasing energy prices, it is clear that farmers in Europe will not be able to manage this alone in future. For this, we also need strategic coordination on a global scale.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, security of food supply in the EU will be one of the most serious challenges facing security policy in the coming decades. Herein lies the key asset of the Sârbu Report, which highlights the fact that in one or two decades, food and fresh water will be strategic products just as oil and natural gas are today. The timing of the report is particularly fortuitous because discussions are currently under way about the future of the common agricultural policy, the post-2014 budget is being planned, and many are keen on curtailing the budget of the common agricultural policy. It is very important that this common agricultural policy has adequate resources in the future, and to guarantee that it does, the finance ministers and decision makers must be convinced that the agricultural economy in the European Union produces not only food but also public goods, including public environmental goods, which we would not be able to guarantee or produce without agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, speaking of the food security issue, I am bothered by the fact that the report is treating EU countries as a single integrated unit. The situation in new Member States is entirely different from that in older ones. For instance, let me ask one question with regard to Hungary: how is it possible that we are talking about childhood starvation in a country with exceptional agricultural resources? Children and adults alike are starving in the centre of the European Union. My other question: how is it possible that our agriculture has taken such a dysfunctional turn that we are producing raw agricultural products on vast areas on an industrial scale, primarily in some – forgive me for the expression – colonial way, only to have them processed abroad, where the profits are made, and then returned to Hungary, where they are sold at high prices? Something is fundamentally wrong here.</p>

      <p sl="ga">In four minutes, Mrs Sârbu covered a multitude of issues. I am not going to go over all the things she mentioned, but I would like to reiterate two points. First, there is a need for a well-funded CAP. I hope this Parliament will play a key role in ensuring that the CAP is not demeaned or diminished in any way. Second, we need to ensure that young people are encouraged to go into farming as a livelihood.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Furthermore, we have a policy of encouraging the growth of energy crops on good agricultural land. In view of the fact that we may be facing a food shortage worldwide, with a population increasing at a rate of 80 million per year, should we reassess that policy? Are we robbing Peter to pay Paul, or perhaps robbing Paul and Peter and finishing up with nothing? That is the question I would like to ask.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear from the report that things in agriculture cannot continue as they are, either. We, or rather, large enterprises, cannot continue to transport agricultural products from one end of the world to another. Of course, we can carry on without any compelling logic. apples, peppers, tomatoes and meat products are transported into Europe, including into Hungary – but mostly not from Spain or from the Netherlands, but from China and from Brazil. We could certainly continue on this path, but the products must be loaded onto transportation equipment such as ships, on which they travel for weeks or months. These products must be kept fresh with various preservatives that are toxic when consumed in large quantities. Now, people buy these products in large commercial chains and then wonder where all these diseases, cancers and tumours come from. It is, of course, obvious that they are caused by food colourings and artificial additives. I must add that instead of supporting multinational corporations, we must support smallholders so that they can be Europe’s lifesavers in a developing food crisis.</p>

    <intervention id="1-243-000" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security that this report speaks of is inseparable from the recognition and promotion of the concept of food sovereignty. The greater the food dependency and food insecurity of a country, the more difficult it is to guarantee a sufficient supply of food to its population, in terms of both quantity and quality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Food sovereignty is the best insurance against food product price volatility, an issue that has dramatically re-emerged on the order of business. This volatility has its origins fundamentally in the financial speculation carried out on food products, an area on which the speculators, investment funds, hedge funds, pension funds and large banking institutions have focused so much of their attention that the other speculative bubbles have either dried up or burst.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The only way to stop this speculation is to do away with the instruments that make it viable, namely, certain financial products such as over-the-counter derivatives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Sadly, the measures that the European Union has adopted in this area are far from being capable of putting the brakes on this sinister wave of speculation and its inhumane consequences – as is acknowledged in a recent United Nations report authored by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are discussing the poorest of the poor – the European Roma – and, together with the new Hungarian Presidency, we are all addressing the European Roma strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among inter-sectoral issues that concern the poorest of the poor, agriculture is very rarely addressed, notably because no land is owned by the poorest of the poor in Europe. So we are talking not just about food security but about having food on the table. As one of my colleagues has already said, this is an essential question for the EU today. I believe that the agricultural sector – and the Commission’s work on these documents – has to be in line with all the EU micro-regional development projects which are concerned with fighting poverty and securing food on the table for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this timely report, as food prices are rising sharply, mainly due to erratic weather conditions and natural disasters, but also to increases in energy prices that impact on the cost of food.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sârbu, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Food security is fundamental for the almost one billion people around the world that still suffer from hunger, but it is also important for vulnerable populations across Europe. For them, the common agricultural policy makes a real difference. The – sometimes criticised – CAP has managed to provide EU citizens with food at affordable prices and has ensured food security in Europe. This must continue. Food security is identified as a central issue in the communication on the common agricultural policy towards 2020 that was adopted on 18 November by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report that Mrs Sârbu has put in front of us underlines the issue of excessive price volatility, which is closely linked to food security because of the impact it has both on farmers and on consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully agrees that there is a need to tackle excessive price volatility. We must collectively look for better regulation, supervision and transparency to address market issues, and this requires not only better financial regulations but also substantially improved transparency on the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report recommends the creation of a global food system. Not an easy subject. We have had experiences in the past of commodity boards. They have proved not to be successful and therefore, this topic undoubtedly requires more detailed debate. It also requires analysis of the experience we have gained, for example, from the EUR 1 billion Food Facility adopted by the Commission in 2008, and also from the work that the Commission undertakes closely with the FAO and the World Food Programme to ensure that bumper stocks are pre-positioned in order to soften the blow of rising food prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these efforts can be developed when the G20 looks closely into the food stocks issue, and you can be assured that the European Commission will be an active participant in the related deliberations in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report has made a call, echoed by many of you here this evening, for a strong agricultural and rural development policy in Europe, capable of ensuring food security for all, with the support of research and innovation to face the challenges of producing more with the fewer resources we have and will have.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully agrees with this. There is no more relevant instrument to fulfil these objectives than a strong common agricultural policy able to guarantee the economic and environmental competitiveness of agriculture and – as some of you said – able to bring young people into the agricultural sector of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Food security is a political priority at both European and world level. The globalisation of the food chain means that new challenges – and sometimes risks to health and consumer interests – are constantly emerging.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the main challenges that the European Union will have to face up to is developing agricultural and food reforms in order to satisfy the needs of the global population. According to recent figures, the world’s population is steadily increasing, and it is thought that it will increase by around 40% by 2050, creating an increase in demand for food which is expected to double current requirements.</p>
      <p sl="it">To tackle the rising growth in world demand for agricultural products and foodstuffs, the Member States and the Union will need to ensure the security of food supply. To attain this objective, the EU will have to guarantee the security of food products bearing in mind their specific characteristics and, at the same time, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I should like to ask the Commission to look at all possible measures to improve training for young people at work and to create job opportunities for graduates in the field of food security, with the principal objective of contributing to employment in the agriculture sector.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is quite right to emphasise the importance of food security for the inhabitants of the EU, as it is their basic human right. The EU must therefore strive to ensure that healthy and nutritious foods are financially and physically accessible to all EU citizens, enabling them to lead an active and healthy life. We must strictly monitor compliance with the highest standards for food and agricultural production, for the safety and quality of foods, and also for their environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, in these circumstances, it is also necessary to point out the strict need for similar quality and safety standards in relation to foods imported from third countries, in order to protect the competitiveness of European farmers. I would also like to support the measures, which will motivate farmers to improve energy efficiency, as energy costs are a key factor in the profitability of farming activities. In my opinion, the most important aspect of the whole report is the emphatic appeal to the Commission to secure, in the public interest and in cooperation with Member States, public access to information on the results of food security monitoring, particularly through the rapid communication of this information between Member States. We simply cannot allow another failure like the selling of meat containing traces of dioxin, as is now happening in Germany, when other Member States were given insufficient and late information as to the situation that arose.</p>

      <p sl="en">As we begin to consider what the final make-up will be of the CAP post-2013, the themes of food security, food shortages and sustainability are coming ever more to the fore. This is something that almost everyone in this House, and everyone who will be involved in drawing up the bill, will recognise. The biofuel boom several years ago, coupled with the global food crisis in 2009, has shown us how scarce a resource food is beginning to become. As such, our vision must be narrowed: the sustainability of food and the needs of those who do not have automatic access to food must be put first; farming practices and innovations should be geared towards more food, and the correct crops; and, as we draft the new CAP bill, we should finally ensure that the new CAP will work towards a carbon-free Europe, and one which does not exacerbate the current carbon problem.</p>

      <p sl="cs">We consider security of food supply to be one of the basic human rights. In today’s world, there are 900 million people suffering from constant hunger due to poverty. The world’s population is set to exceed 9 billion by 2050, and global food production will have to increase by up to 70%. Agriculture must, on the one hand, boost output, and, on the other, cope with high energy costs, an ever diminishing area of non-polluted land and the consequences of climate change. We must address the instability and fluctuating prices caused by speculation on the commodity markets and declining food stocks. The future security of supply of basic foods requires a strong common agricultural policy (CAP). The CAP must improve food security by boosting productivity and supporting both environmentally sustainable food production and traditional agriculture, small farmers, organic farms, and the local and regional distribution of foods. These agricultural models contribute to food security, as they employ methods and procedures proven for generations in individual regions of the EU. Agriculture is the most strategic EU policy, the success of which will help to ensure the survival of Europe’s population in a time of food crisis. In order for the CAP to be capable of combating the effects of climate change, maintaining food prices at an acceptable level and increasing the supply of healthy foods, it is essential for its budget to be preserved at least at the existing level.</p>

      <p sl="lv">European agriculture is one of the Union’s strategically most important sectors, as it provides more than 500 million people with their food supply. So that European agricultural policy may carry out its most important task, namely, to provide Europe’s population with healthy and good quality food at reasonable prices, while ensuring an adequate income for farmers, it must be competitive in the global market and there must be a guarantee of fair competition in Europe’s internal market. Hence, what we must achieve with CAP reform is a level playing field for all Europe’s farmers. EU Member States have not encountered food security problems. Nevertheless, such risks will exist in the future, and we have to react accordingly, before that occurs. We must take into account that farmers are already having to work for minimal incomes or even at a loss, and this has an adverse effect on their ability to maintain production. It is also a fact that natural disasters affect food prices in the shops and hence, how available food is to people. We must acknowledge the strategic importance of agriculture in the European Union and do all we can to ensure that in the future, the people of Europe will not have to experience food shortages as a result of the failure of EU politicians and governments to have spotted the risks in time and to avert them. The recognition of agriculture as a strategically important sector for food security is an important step towards avoiding food security issues in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">The own-initiative report recognises the fact that agriculture is of strategic importance in the context of global food security. A glance into the future shows how urgent the need for action is. By 2050, experts estimate that global demand for food will double. Agriculture must be in a position to be able to meet the enormous needs of the growing population for safe and adequate food. At the same time, the obstacles resulting from the limitation of natural resources, high energy prices and climate change need to be dealt with. I supported the report, which clearly demonstrates that food security is a central concern in the European Union, too, and requires coordination of the individual policy areas. Only if the areas of agricultural policy, development policy, trade policy, financial policy and energy policy, as well as research, work together can improvements be achieved. Securing the incomes of farmers and an adequate supply of good quality food must therefore be key goals of the common agricultural policy. The greatly fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector are the result of crop failures, speculation and a concentration in trade, and these are significant uncertainty factors. Interventions and stockpiling are the crisis mechanisms that will put a stop to market abuse and speculative transactions. It is important that these market intervention mechanisms play a central role in the future common agricultural policy. Another important point is the recommendation for the development of a global system of food stocks and emergency reserves.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Europe needs a common agricultural policy which will guarantee the development, and not the stagnation, of European agriculture. Agricultural policy must respond to European and global challenges, particularly when we take into account the fact that, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, food production has to increase by at least 70% to meet the needs of a world population which, by 2050, is set to exceed 9 billion. It can be seen, then, that the common agricultural policy needs to increase food security by increasing efficiency, while at the same time promoting an environmentally sustainable food policy. I would like to point out that regulations in this area should be transparent. I appreciate initiatives which recommend the promotion of agricultural diversity and the use of traditional and ecological agriculture. In addition, it is important to ensure that young farmers have access to land and loans in order to achieve the objectives of the CAP, such as innovation, modernisation, improving competitiveness and, above all, modern agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The link between the European common agricultural policy (CAP) and global food security is an important theme that must be taken into account during the process of drafting the CAP post-2013. Indeed, the priorities of the CAP must be viewed against the backdrop not only of the aspirations of our modern-day society, but also of the constraints that will be imposed on us throughout the world in the future. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, food production must increase by at least 70% if it is to meet the growing needs of the world’s population. Europe must take account of world food security and must increase its production with a view to limiting imports. In addition, I support the proposal to review our financial legislation in order to combat price volatility, which is caused mainly by speculation. To be effective, however, this review must be carried out simultaneously at international level. I am delighted that one of the priorities of the French Presidency of the G20 in this area is to combat food and commodity price volatility.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The increase in global demand for food, resulting from the planet’s growing population, obviously has an impact on natural food resources and entails new food security regulations and precautions. The EU’s priority task is to guarantee Member States the right to food security and to support developing countries in achieving a sufficient food security level. I think that it is important to promote the production and sale of local traditional foods. Numerous benefits can be derived from regional food products: lower transport costs and a lower risk of food perishing. There are many regions with significant agricultural potential which has remained untapped due to social or economic imbalances, against the background of an increasingly ageing rural population or of industrialisation. Indeed, large areas of farmland are not used efficiently. Regional authorities can play a key role in food security by supporting the agricultural capacity of the regions which have this potential. The EU is one of the global leaders in the field of research and innovation, including in the agricultural sector. A steady rise in the urban population’s majority poses a new challenge: how much of a priority is the development of urban agriculture with a view to guaranteeing food security, using various models such as vertical urban agriculture?</p>

      <p sl="it">I support the approach suggested by the resolution adopted today in this Chamber: food safety is a basic human right and it is achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to suitable, safe and nutritious food. In the European Union, around 80 million people still live below the poverty line today, and many of them are helped through food aid programmes. A proper diet is necessarily a key factor in our health, and there are still too many doubts being raised about genetically modified organisms by part of the scientific community. For this reason, I am against the text’s openness to GMOs, particularly the part that provides for extending the approval process for importing genetically modified foods from third countries into the European Union. For the sake of consistency, I do not believe that we can forbid our farmers from using a technique that we then tolerate in the production of imports. However, I do support the measures to encourage young farmers, who currently represent just 7% of the total, with installation premiums, subsidised interest rates on loans and other incentives which have been implemented by Member States through their rural development budgets, safe in the knowledge that European agricultural production can maintain its current high levels of quality and safety.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security. However, I also wish to express my dismay that Parliament decided to allocate so little time to debating it. This topic is particularly current at the present moment when we have realised how the food crisis can affect states’ stability. One of the causes of the uprising in Tunisia has been the increase in food prices. Algeria, India and Bangladesh are also states where rising food prices have caused serious tensions. The increasing cultivation of biofuel crops, financial speculation, producers switching very rapidly to more profitable crops and, last but not least, the change in the eating habits of citizens in many states, are also new topics closely related to the subject of today’s report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to make one final comment. In an index produced by a Japanese bank indicating vulnerability to food price rises, four of the forty most vulnerable countries are Member States of the European Union, with another state soon to become an EU member, and three states are the EU’s immediate neighbours. This is an interesting index which must give us food for thought.</p>

      <p sl="cs">If we regard agriculture as a strategic area, then an essential precondition for ensuring the security of food supplies is for the European Union to be self-sufficient, at least in the production of basic foods and animal fodders. EU dependence on imports of agricultural products causes food price rises, and undermines the EU’s direct producers in the marketing chain. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), demand for food and animal fodder could rise by 70% by 2050. It will therefore be necessary to use all available forms of agriculture, and to provide significant support for financial investment into scientific research in this area. The efficient use of traditional agricultural varieties that are characteristic to certain regions also requires greater support and public interest. For example, assessment of the environmental impact of food production and transport distances is easily understood by the consumer. Current wastage levels of up to 50% in the overall production chain, and the disproportionate growth in freight transport, are not factors compatible with ensuring the security of food supply. We cannot pretend to ensure food security and protect the environment while at the same time tolerating a dependence on products grown on another continent and imported over thousands of kilometres. Such practices create an enormous environmental footprint and, at the same time, oblige developing countries to import almost all necessary foods, making them dependent, ruining their economies, impoverishing their inhabitants and destroying their environment.</p>
