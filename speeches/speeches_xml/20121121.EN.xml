      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate about the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council meeting (22-23 November 2012) with particular reference to the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you have all read the publications that have appeared in the course of the past few hours. I think we are moving into a decisive phase in these negotiations. We have the Commission President here, as well as Minister Mavroyiannis as the Council’s representative, so I would like to say again that while the European Parliament has undoubtedly adopted some ambitious decisions, it is fully mindful of the responsibility to maintain the European Union’s performance capacities and ensure that the objectives and tasks set by the heads of state and government continue to be affordable for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am assuming that the Council and the Commission will uphold these shared objectives, also in relation to the financial endowment that is to be provided for the European Union. I am sure that the Commission will abide by this course, although I am less certain that the Council has fully appreciated the critical nature of the situation. I hope that this will be elucidated during the course of today’s debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to participate in this debate. As you know, this week’s extraordinary meeting of the European Council is convened in order to deal with the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last months the Cyprus Presidency and our trio of partners beforehand have invested a lot of time and effort into what is a very complicated and challenging file following last year’s Commission proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of the Cyprus Presidency was to maintain the momentum and mature the dossier, preparing the file for a full discussion aiming to reach an agreement this year. To this end, we held extensive bilateral consultations in July, followed by an issues paper and an informal General Affairs Council meeting in Cyprus. Then, we issued two non-papers on various issues covering macroeconomic conditionality, better spending, RAL, flexibility and corrections, trying to advance the discussion and provide solutions where possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having taken into account the wish of Parliament to wait for the vote on the relevant interim report, we only introduced for the first time figures in late October in the negotiating box. This proposal was underpinned by difficult political choices, trying to pave the way for a balanced agreement. Overall, I believe that work in the Council in the past few months and the interaction with all institutions and stakeholders has covered some important ground facilitating the prospects for an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">All along this process, we have worked very closely and constructively with Parliament. We met formally before and after each General Affairs Council according to the procedure agreed under the Hungarian Presidency. In addition, Parliament’s negotiating team was invited to participate at the informal ministerial meeting in Cyprus in August and also in an informal ministerial breakfast in Luxembourg last month. Of course, beyond these formal meetings, we have held many other informal discussions which have been very fruitful and conducive to advancing this file.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiating team of Parliament also had an extensive meeting with the cabinet of President Van Rompuy in the framework of the bilateral meetings held between 5 and 12 November 2012. On 13 November 2012, the President of the European Council presented a draft set of European Council conclusions which include all the elements which will need to be part of an agreement. The text presented further develops the work carried out by the presidencies, differentiating in a number of aspects, something normal at this stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last Monday we had an extensive meeting with Mr Lamassoure, Chair of the Committee on Budgets, and the negotiating team of Parliament, along with the head of the cabinet of President Van Rompuy and the competent Commissioners. This meeting allowed for a fruitful and productive exchange of views on the draft European Council Conclusions and for Parliament’s substantial input. We all know how important it is to get the EU’s future financial framework right.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency supports the President of the European Council in his determination to secure a deal later this week. This is essential for the credibility of the Union and for its ability to deliver to and on behalf of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">This package takes us towards an eventual compromise. The proposal reduces the original Commission proposal by approximately EUR 75 billion for the MFF itself and an additional EUR 6 billion for those elements outside the MFF. The draft conclusions do not contain options.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament has consistently sought to maintain the level of expenditure originally proposed by the Commission. Even if, on a personal basis, I may regret that this has not proved possible, we must all be realistic. Europe has been through one of the most severe crises, and despite significant efforts at both national and EU level, the effects of this crisis will continue to be felt for some time. We have no choice but to reflect this dire situation in the MFF and draw and assume the ensuring outfall.</p>
      <p sl="en">We live at a time of severe constraint as a result of the need for fiscal consolidation. The negotiations on the European budget cannot take place in complete isolation from this reality, however uncomfortable that is. We need to cement together fiscal consolidation with investment in growth and jobs through an unavoidably tight MFF, which is our main investment tool.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we are fully aware of the arguments on European added value, complementarity, synergy, economies of scale and how valid all those arguments are, but under the circumstances it was felt that these parameters could be appropriately addressed through the improvement of the quality of spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">To reach a compromise we have to go below the Commission proposal. I cannot say now by how much exactly, but I believe that the latest proposals are not very far from where we are likely to end up. The conclusions put forward by the President of the European Council contain cuts across all headings.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards instruments outside the MFF and flexibility, the President has been guided by the principle that lower ceilings require greater flexibility in a seven-year framework. It is not therefore proposed to reduce the flexibility instrument. Furthermore, a contingency margin is part of the package.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may have seen that the conclusions also put forward some proposals from the revenue side such as retaining the option of reforming the VAT-based own resource while the option of having the financial transaction tax as an own resource has also been kept on the table. Last, but not least, a reform of the system of corrections is proposed in order to make them more transparent and fair, within the limits of what seems to be achievable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole day tomorrow will be taken up with bilaterals between the Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission with all heads of state or government of Member States to test out the likely basis on which a compromise can be reached. The European Council will open tomorrow evening, with a discussion with you, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that President Van Rompuy is committed to achieving a compromise. The European Council is therefore expected to last as long as it takes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that throughout this whole process the representatives of Parliament have been extremely helpful and cooperative. You will see that a number of your concerns have been addressed in the draft European Council conclusions. I am sure that all the institutions and the Member States will do their utmost to ensure that we reach a conclusion on this issue by the end of the year. The Cyprus Presidency stands ready to facilitate the agreement both amongst the Member States and with Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-009-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow and the day after, the European Council will meet in Brussels to discuss the future budgetary framework of the European Union for the period 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">what is at stake is the prosperity and stability of Europe, its economic competitiveness and social cohesion. The goal is sustainable, job-creating growth, but as we all know, we cannot legislate for growth or create jobs by waving a magic wand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From the Europe 2020 strategy to the conclusions of the European Council of June 2012, declarations calling for job-creating, sustainable development have come thick and fast. the question now is how the governments intend to match their deeds to their words.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The decisions on the European Union’s future budgetary framework are a key test of our credibility, because the European budget is our main instrument for investing in growth and job creation. We have plenty of other ways to promote growth, through the internal market and international trade, for example, but in terms of investment the main tool is the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget alone can ensure the funding for a European dynamic that national budgets individually could not support. This dynamic is crucial for growth and jobs in Europe, because it creates a genuine European area of economic, social and territorial cohesion, education, research and innovation, and infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be perfectly clear: the governments will defend, first and foremost, what they see as their national interest, and it is for the Community institutions – the Commission and Parliament – to present the truly European dimension of the issues at stake. The Commission is still convinced that its proposals represent the general European interest and the interests of all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget is not, as is sometimes claimed, a budget for Brussels or Strasbourg. More than 94 % of the budget is spent entirely on European citizens. It is a budget for investing in the economy of all Member States, our regions, towns and countryside. It is a budget for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and for strengthening convergence and European solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is thus essentially what enables improvements to be made at European level to the lives of our fellow citizens, above all through the cohesion policy, which is the ultimate policy of solidarity, but equally a policy for growth, economic convergence and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cohesion policy has been able to adapt to the circumstances and has proved more necessary than ever in these times of austerity. It is a policy that serves both the beneficiary countries and the contributors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a third of the Member States, more than 50 % of public investment is cofinanced with cohesion policy funds. In some countries, the rate is as high as 75 %, or even 97 %.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These figures show just how important these policies are. Without Structural Funds, these countries – especially most of the new Member States – will not be able to guarantee jobs or press ahead with their fiscal consolidation or structural reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, these policies also benefit the contributing countries, and specifically the largest contributors to the budget, whose companies in turn benefit from considerable investment opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In many cases, there is clear evidence that more than 50 % of the Structural Funds allocated to cohesion countries flow back to the economies of the major contributing countries, because it is the companies in these countries that are able to carry out large infrastructure projects and provide the necessary technology. This really is a win-win policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cohesion policy is not just a policy for the poorest Members: according to the Treaties, it is a policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion for the entire European Union. It is a goal for the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The budget of the European Union allows us to have genuinely common policies. As a result of the synergies achieved in this way, we can make savings while safeguarding the integrity of the single market. This is true of agriculture, for example, where 27 different national policies would be a lot more expensive than one common agriculture policy. Have we really thought about what would happen if there were no common agriculture policy? If we had market fragmentation in Europe as a result of 27 different national agricultural policies?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The CAP has always proved adaptable to new socioeconomic challenges, and is even now undergoing further reform. Europe needs a strong, up-to-date, competitive, innovative and green CAP more than ever, to meet the European public’s demands for food supplies and a healthy lifestyle, but also to help combat climate change and contribute to the sustainable management of our natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To those who say – and some do – that we must scale down our proposal because the Community budget must contribute to the vast fiscal consolidation effort under way in Europe, I say: ‘that is exactly what we are doing’. Pooling expenditure in our common policies represents added value and hence real savings, and it benefits, first and foremost, the European taxpayer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To be quite clear, opposing this budget will not advance the cause of fiscal consolidation. It will, in fact, hamper it by sacrificing expenditure that brings greater synergies and efficiency, and promises greater returns. The European budget allows us to create a real European space that is much more than the sum of its parts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sharing costs enables us to develop other projects, too, such as the free movement of knowledge, which we call the ‘fifth freedom’. This is how we will achieve better results in the key areas of education and research, which are vital to a competitive Europe that can maintain or establish its leadership in the sectors of the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is exactly what we are proposing in our ‘Erasmus for All’ programme, which will cost less than 2 % of the total budget but will make a huge difference to millions of young Europeans who will be able to study, train and work in another country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also what we are proposing in the Horizon 2020 programme, to ensure that Europe remains a place of innovation and spectacular scientific breakthroughs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A group of Nobel Prize winners in the sciences and winners of the Fields medal for mathematics have signed a joint petition, which they presented to me recently in Brussels. This petition, which was launched by 44 European Nobel laureates and six Fields medallists and has already collected the signatures of over 130 000 European scientists, predominantly young researchers, reminds us that a euro invested in research and innovation, which brings together the very best talent at European level, will often have a greater impact than a euro spent at national level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These researchers and scientists applaud the globally recognised success of the European Research Council set up by the European Union. At a time when the European Union is starting to attract the best researchers in the world and young European researchers are deciding to stay in Europe, the worst thing that Europe could do would be to cut off the fuel to the jet engine of European research and innovation just as the plane is taking off.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget also allows the Member States to finance projects that they would not be able to fund themselves, such as the large pan-European networks needed to ‘connect’ Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are familiar with our proposal for the Connecting Europe Facility to promote interconnected trans-European networks in transport, energy and digital technology.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several of Europe’s leading CEOs, whose vision is European and global, not parochial and mean-spirited, have signed a letter calling for the budget to support this Facility. Why? Because they know perfectly well that without the European budget there would be no lever to carry out this investment in the infrastructure that is essential to the Europe we envisage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are also areas where, by pooling our powers, we can achieve better results, for example in justice and security, in the smooth running of the Schengen area, and in the fight against illegal immigration. Things cannot go on as they are now. Whenever there is a very serious problem of illegal immigration, people look to Europe and ask what Europe is doing about it. As we all very well know, however, Europe does not have the resources to tackle this problem unless we share national powers in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are proposing, therefore, is better spending to achieve targeted results in our main priority areas. Some people are calling for cuts on all sides, on the grounds that it will not really make any difference to Europe. However, I can assure you that what might be a small amount for Europe as a whole can make an enormous difference to some of our policies and some of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does each billion cut from the Horizon 2020 programme mean? It means 4 000 small and medium-sized enterprises deprived of financing for innovation to create jobs and growth; and 600 top researchers and their teams who will no longer be able to carry out their work, work upon which our future prosperity depends. It means, for example, the end of the Innovative Medicines Initiative in the health sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A small percentage cut for ‘Connecting Europe’ spells the end of European leadership in transport. It means abandoning our CO2 reduction projects, such as the carbon capture and storage project, and dropping our plans to develop connections re-linking Eastern Europe with Western Europe. If we make cuts, even small ones, to the already relatively modest culture budget, we will forfeit job creation in a key sector and stifle European creativity at a time when this is more vital than ever.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Making cuts to the Commission’s proposal to create a Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived might not have a major impact on the overall amount, but it will make a dramatic difference to the 116 million Europeans, including 25 million children, facing poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, how do you explain to the people of Europe that when there are summits in Brussels to find hundreds of billions of euros to save the banks, we reach an agreement, but when it comes to a few million to help the poor, the negative voices outnumber the positive ones? What are they to make of that?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">If we call into question the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund when there are unacceptable levels of unemployment in Europe, we will deprive millions of unemployed people of the chance to train and find work. We will also do away with one of the most innovative instruments for providing social support when companies relocate to other countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few thousandths of a percentage cut to European Development Fund and humanitarian aid is a matter of life and death for the world’s most vulnerable people, because these are not just figures, but real people’s lives. Such a move would go against our values, but also our interests. I repeat: I am not just talking generally about values and interests here, I am talking about real people. For example, I recently visited a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan where UNICEF’s Executive Director told me that without European Union aid none of those young girls and boys would have access to education at all. The girls I saw there were studying in tents. Their towns had been destroyed by the Assad regime. They are pouring across the borders in their hundreds of thousands and Europe is there to help. Are we going to cut back our efforts now in the face of such tragedies?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yesterday, Mr President, you hosted the President of Haiti here in Strasbourg. I also had the opportunity to receive him in Brussels. On behalf of the Haitian people, he thanked Europe, which, in spite of its economic difficulties, has not forgotten Haiti, a country completely devastated by the earthquake that killed over 300 000 of its people. He thanked Europe for giving Haiti’s children hope for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Africa, where we Europeans have a special responsibility, and in many other countries of the world, too, Europe cannot renege on its commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the Europe I believe in, that we all believe in: an open, caring Europe, a Europe that is not about to turn its back on the rest of the world!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, giving the European Union the budget it deserves means giving ourselves the possibility of rebuilding the economy on new foundations. It also means keeping our promise that spending will be mobilised for growth and jobs, competitiveness and convergence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the Commission remains committed to its initial proposal. The Union budget must genuinely support our growth agenda, and I am pleased to see that, in general, our proposals are backed by this Parliament and by a majority of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 13 November, I joined Parliament’s President at a summit of the Friends of Cohesion in the European Parliament in Brussels. It was organised jointly by the Prime Minister of Poland and the Prime Minister of Portugal and was attended by representatives of 16 governments, the social partners, BUSINESSEUROPE and the European Trade Union Confederation. The social partners, which do not always agree, are in agreement on this. They are pushing for the EU budget not to be cut as it is essential for growth. The message from them was clear and unanimous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I called on the ‘friends of cohesion’ and the friends of ‘better spending’ to unite in a grand European coalition of the ‘friends of growth’. The greatest risk I see today is that the cuts will damage those forward-looking areas that are essential for growth. There is a paradox here: it is precisely because of certain demands by the ‘better spending’ group that we are busy cutting the overall budget, which in all likelihood will most jeopardise those policies that look to the future and enhance competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not deny that the better spending agenda is crucial, and I have said as much to the cohesion countries, too. I am a fan of cohesion, but I am also a fan of better spending. Let us be frank: we must be critical of some types of European spending that have not always brought added value as far as competitiveness is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why we want to align cohesion policy with the Europe 2020 objectives for sustainable, intelligent growth, not just any form of growth. For this reason – and I know this is not very popular in certain quarters, but I have to say it – we are in favour of macroeconomic conditionalities in this area. We must align our various policies within the framework of the efforts being made for better economic governance. It is thus essential that our investment is efficient. The added value of every single euro is essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do wonder, nonetheless, whether those who would also like to make deep cuts in administrative expenditure are really concerned about efficiency, in the sense of wanting to make the best possible use of the resources available, or whether their real aim is to weaken the institutions like the Commission and the Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">A swingeing cut in expenditure that represents less than 6 % of the budget would have only a minimal effect on the overall savings being sought. We need – and this has to be said – an independent civil service in Europe, a high-calibre civil service to draft laws and develop projects to serve Europe as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before I conclude, let me add two further points. First, the Commission is fighting for appropriate flexibility. It must be possible to adapt the budget, over the years, to changes in the economic situation. The contributions must therefore be real money, not virtual resources, particularly when we are currently facing a crisis in certain Member States that need to be able to make investment not in 2020 but in 2014, under the new European budget and even before that under the budgets for 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the Commission reiterates its proposal for a system of own resources that is closer to the rules of the Treaty, which state that the Union budget should be financed from own resources. It is important that in the next few days the European Council indicates its willingness to proceed in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main thing, finally, ladies and gentlemen, is that we all work together towards these objectives, in a spirit of loyal cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, negotiation is all about making compromises. The Commission will go to the meeting of the European Council with this in mind, but we must remember that we need constructive compromises, compromises that strengthen Europe, not help to destroy it. Everyone has a role to play in this. What is important is that we have a budget that acts as a real catalyst for growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore ask the Heads of State or Government meeting in Brussels to listen to the voices of the Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, who remind us that the future of Europe depends on research and innovation. Listen to the voices of Erasmus students, who want the best possible education. Listen to the voices of the regions, business organisations and trade unions in their own countries, who tell us how essential investment is for recovery and growth. Listen to the voices of entrepreneurs, who are waiting for investment in infrastructure to connect Europe by means of transport, energy and digital technology. Listen to the voices of the people queuing at food banks, who cannot understand why, in this current social crisis, so many countries offer so little hope to the poor. Listen to the voices of the unemployed, who look to Europe to offer better prospects for the future. Listen to the voices of our international partners, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental organisations, who are asking that Europe remain engaged in the world, committed to development aid and to providing leadership in the fight against climate change and for sustainable development. Listen to the voices of children throughout the world, who say that without the European Union they would be without hope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I urge the European governments to listen to the voice of this democratically elected Parliament, which represents Europe’s citizens. I urge them to listen so that we can build a stronger Europe, a Europe of growth and jobs.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, EUR 50 billion less; no, EUR 80 billion less; EUR 100 billion, EUR 200 billion: who is offering more and who is offering less? This is the question which appears to be uppermost in the minds of the European governments today. It is a shameful ‘race to the bottom’, with no discussion of the tasks on the European Union’s agenda. It is as if the European budget were a zero-sum game: what I give to you, I lose, and what you win, I lose.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are plenty of companies from the net contributors operating in the cohesion countries, investing and creating jobs but also earning income, but this is conveniently ignored. It is not a zero-sum game, it is a united Europe to which we should be committed. It is a Europe with a specific agenda to fulfil. The President has pointed out that we should not only be talking numbers, we should also talking tasks, and I am grateful to him for that. That is what the Commission President has done. Mr Barroso, I encourage you to maintain your fighting spirit! If you keep fighting, we will have you firmly on our side and then, together, we will achieve a successful outcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me ask the Council this. What about Europe’s numerous young unemployed? How are they supposed to manage without Europe’s assistance? Is that the message we want to send out to them? Should we scale down successful programmes like Erasmus? Is that how we should prepare for the mobility that is required? Should research funding, which is already in short supply, be cut back even further? Is that our contribution to competitiveness? Should a European budgetary straitjacket now be introduced in parallel to the national budget restraint and the credit crunch? Let me make the point that we did not create the debt; it was the individual Member States that did that. Is this our contribution to growth?</p>
      <p sl="de">President Barroso has already mentioned international solidarity, and especially our solidarity towards neighbouring countries. Are these concepts merely empty words? I would ask the foreign ministers to remain silent next time if they are not prepared to follow their words with action and financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Have we set excessively high targets for development cooperation? We said that this is a policy area that Europe can now deal with, so national budgets can be reduced, but now cuts are being called for at the European level as well. That is the policy approach being advocated here. It is a policy that lacks courage. Yes, we need to make savings, but why are we not seeing the heads of government making savings in relation to the establishment of the European patent court, for example? Apparently, the court now needs three separate sites! What is more, Mr Cameron, the economiser-in-chief, is determined to host one of these sites in London! That has nothing to do with restraint!</p>
      <p sl="de">Why are we not generating funds where there is scope to do so, for example through more efficient measures to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance? The approach adopted here is one of extreme caution, but if tackled properly, it would yield enough funding for the European and the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not confuse thriftiness with a lack of courage. In the European Parliament, we – my group and many fellow Members – are prepared to make savings. However, we also have the courage to commit to the tasks that lie ahead. We are not simply making demands; we want to play our part. That is not always popular here in the House, but we have the courage to do so. Let me say this to the members of the Council: we also have the courage to say ‘no’ when we are presented with bad compromises. We are prepared to vote for compromises, but not bad ones. The Council needs to understand that.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is much more that I would like to say about the budget, but in response to recent events, I would also like to touch upon an issue which is causing us grave concern and which, perhaps, has an – albeit indirect – connection with the budget, namely the situation in Gaza. I think we would all be willing to contribute larger sums of money from our budgets if this helped to offer the people in Palestine, especially in the Gaza Strip, a brighter future, indeed, any future at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">We would all like to see Israel pursuing policies which give more scope and leeway to the Gaza Strip and release it from the present stranglehold. However, let me make one thing very clear, and I say this quite deliberately: Hamas must stop targeting civilians in Israel at last. This is not helping the people of Gaza, it does not promote peace, and it does not give us Europeans any possibility of bringing influence to bear on Israel and encouraging it to pursue different policies at last, and by that I mean policies which would be beneficial to people in this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to help the people in the region, and international aid and the assistance from the European Union are essential here. Every day, we see new conflicts emerging in the world around us, and then these same heads of government and foreign ministers want to make cuts. Let me say this: I hope that the Egyptians will have the chance to help build peace, and by that I mean peace in the region, where peace is so urgently needed. That would also give Europe the opportunity to bring influence to bear, together with Egypt, and encourage Israel to pursue policies which give fresh prospects to the people of Palestine. However, Hamas should abandon its senseless policy of targeting civilians. That is something we cannot tolerate. That should be the clear message sent out from this sitting of the European Parliament today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Do you think, Mr Swoboda, that it is fair to EU taxpayers that Israel destroys Gaza every now and then? Every couple of years the citizens of the European Union have to build it up again. Would it not be fairer to stop Israel killing innocent people in Gaza and stop the violence and stop the occupation as well?</p>

    <intervention id="3-013-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Ms Morvai, if you had listened attentively, you would have understood what I said about Israel and Gaza. Yes, we do want to use our budgetary resources so that whatever we build actually remains standing over the long term. There were two points to be made here, and I expressed both of them very clearly. The war must end. In the past, we spent too much money on building things that were later destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important to make that clear, but we should not draw a veil over the other aspect. For me, that means sending a clear signal to Hamas. We must work with Egypt to help bring peace to this region. That is important, also in order to ensure that the funds that we provide are not wasted but are used for our own region’s or our neighbours’ future.</p>

    <intervention id="3-014-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, six years ago Tony Blair, who was then the President of the Council, when presenting the multiannual financial framework for 2006–2012 said in this House ‘never again must we repeat the negotiations on this framework in the same way’. But here we are again still talking about the same budget, a budget of more or less 1 % of Europe’s GDP, and we are still dealing with reluctant Britain.</p>
      <p sl="de">The only difference now is that Mr Blair has been replaced by Mr Cameron and that the Labour Party is led now by Mr Edward Miliband who a few weeks ago – for purely populist reasons – made a coalition with the Europhobes of the Conservative Party to make a deal on the EU budget even more difficult, if not impossible. So there we are for the moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will not talk about the details of this budget, but let me be very blunt: the whole debate on a little bit more or a little bit less than 1 % of the European GDP is completely ridiculous. First of all, the budgets of Member States like Germany and France are eight to 10 times bigger than the European budget. In recent years they have increased faster than the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European budget is EUR 140 billion. Do you know what the total budgets of all the Member States of the European Union are? EUR 6 300 billion, EUR 6.3 trillion, that is 50 times bigger than the European budget of EUR 140 billion. The daily contribution of citizens to the European budget is 67 cents a day; that is less than a cup of coffee or, for Mr Callanan, less than a cup of tea.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, in the United States, the federal budget is 24 % of GDP. Switzerland is a confederation and has a budget of 12 % of GDP, and we cannot agree on 1 %. The European budget is smaller than the budget of smaller Member States like Belgium or Austria. I have the latest figures here: between 2000 and 2010 national budgets in the EU increased by 62 %, that is more or less twice as much as the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to make a real federal European Union, which we will need to do for tomorrow, the least we can say is that 1 % will not be enough in the future. It is a good starting point, but it cannot be the endgame for the future if we want to really tackle the problems. If we want to overcome the euro crisis or if we want to have a general union, we will need more.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, cuts in the European budget are seen in many of our Member States, and certainly in Britain, as the way to solve their budgetary problems. But the opposite is true. A strong European budget is the only way to overcome the budgetary problems of the Member States: pooling money at European level instead of wasting money at the national level. We have to be very firm on this, and politically this Parliament has to be ready to block a deal if it does not correspond to what was proposed by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, here in the European Union, we are dealing with a banking crisis. Unfortunately, we are also dealing with a sovereign debt crisis, a political crisis, an institutional crisis, and, increasingly, a crisis in the public’s acceptance of the European Union as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is the next common budget for 2014-2020 so crucial for the future of Europe’s citizens? The answer is this: because it must express something that hopefully still exists, namely the shared European will to build a better future; in other words, a European commitment or a volonté générale européenne.</p>
      <p sl="de">From my perspective, David Cameron has simply got it wrong. His logic is that the United Kingdom must make savings, so Europe must do so too, and to the same extent. However, this shows a complete failure to understand that there must be joint investment if we want to invest sustainably in the coming years and genuinely invest in the future. China, India and Brazil will not stand and wait. We have to act together if we genuinely want to assert our citizens’ interests. It is also a false argument, because the fact is that during the period from 2007 to 2013, the European budget grew by just 1.95 %, compared with much larger increases in all the national budgets. This is disproportionate if we genuinely want to press ahead with resolute European policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me reiterate a point made by previous speakers. We are not acting out of egotistical institutional self-interest. This is not about more money for its own sake. It is about securing the additional funding that we need to offer our citizens a better future. It is about generating new competitiveness in the European Union, and ensuring that there is no repetition of the mistakes made in the past, with the bubbles in Spain and elsewhere. It is about genuine and sustainable growth. It is about research and development. It is about sustainable, future-oriented investment. It is about combating youth unemployment, supporting the transformation of our energy systems, promoting technologies and products that reduce our carbon footprint, supporting organic farming, refurbishing the existing building stock, developing the literacy skills of many people in Europe, and investing in our creative industries, which often create more jobs than other sectors. It is about education, education, education, so it is about Erasmus, but it is also about the European film industry, for example. I mention this because we have the award of the LUX Prize later.</p>
      <p sl="de">When Chancellor Merkel spoke to us two weeks ago, she made the following error in my view. She said that 27 Member States had agreed, jointly, to invest 3 % in research and development. This same lady is the leader of a coalition of net contributors in the Council, and their proposals to the Cyprus Presidency include a full 12 % reduction in R&amp;D. This is political schizophrenia! This is not coherence; it is blindness towards the future. The European Parliament rejects this policy and these proposals from Cyprus and Chancellor Merkel, and does so by a large majority!</p>
      <p sl="de">We must show that we are resolute in our commitment to shared investment. Of course, we need to answer the question of where the funds should come from, if not from contributions based on GDP, which, as Mr Verhofstadt has reiterated, is no longer a viable model. It causes major conflicts and results in an approach to negotiations which, in essence, aims to push everything down to the lowest level. That is why the introduction of the financial transaction tax and other new sources of own resources is crucially important. It will give us more political autonomy, more shared interests, and is also a justice issue. The banks must contribute to covering the costs of the crisis. We cannot simply carry on pumping money into the banks. They must take on a share of social responsibility and contribute to the European budget. That is why Commissioner Lewandoski’s proposal, his model for the financial transaction tax – with two-thirds going to the European budget, and one-third to the national budgets – is a very good model and creates positive incentives.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, we must combat tax avoidance because Europe’s citizens rightly regard it as extremely unfair if those who are unwilling to pay, including the wealthy in Greece, are not pursued and made to pay their share. That is something that we should no longer accept. This is a social justice issue and we need to take action here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final comment is this. We are only willing to support a genuine agreement if the level of funding is truly in line with what is needed to perform our future agenda, and if there is more flexibility within the budget, as well as genuine own resources. If the Council does not show substantial movement here, we are prepared to say no, and we will do so – let me say it again – not out of egotistical self-interest but in the interests of Europe’s citizens!</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I would like to ask the Greens’ spokesperson why we need organic farming. This is a system of farming that is 50 years out of date, that does not produce enough for us to eat and that guarantees that food will be more expensive. Why do you want to inflict this on the people of Europe?</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I believe that we do need a reform of agricultural policy. We should not revert to purely national agricultural policies; that would be a step backwards into national ways of thinking. I do not like words such as repatriation, or the emphasis on purely national interests. That is not a responsible policy for the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, there is a substantial need for reform in our agricultural policy. Some of the direct payments to agroindustry are unsustainable, and we cannot continue in this manner. For that reason, however, we need a well-crafted second pillar and the resources that are necessary to initiate reform. That is what I am campaigning for, that is what my fellow Greens stand for, and I hope that we will be able to convince more people that we need healthy food and can continue to pursue a Community policy in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for my Group this debate encapsulates everything that needs to change about the EU. We reject the knee-jerk response of most of the people in this Chamber that the solution to every problem that we have in Member States is somehow ‘more Europe’. So, increasingly, does public opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say to President Barroso that he and many other people in this Chamber have argued that the EU budget is there to promote economic growth. We have heard a lot of glib talk from all sides of this Chamber that it is an investment budget. If it was, perhaps on this side of the House we might support more bits of it, because nobody actually believes that it is an investment budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">If it is an investment budget, how come 40 % of it is still spent on subsidies for farmers? What about the 6 % of the budget that is for administration costs? That is not about investment for growth either. Eight Member States – not just the UK – wrote to President Barroso saying that the EUR 2 billion cost of pensions for EU civil servants in the future was unaffordable and that reform was required. You completely ignored that letter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, how can you insist – and how can the rest of you insist – that we need more spending and more money at an EU level? Five per cent of the existing budget, according to the Court of Auditors, is either spent illegally or irregularly – something like EUR 5 billion. If that money was accounted for properly, if the Commission got its expenditure controls in place, then that would take up almost all of the increase that you are all asking for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us ask about some of the existing projects. Is that all money well spent? How has doubling the number of EU agencies in the last eight years affected growth across Europe? What about the new ECB building in Frankfurt that cost several hundred million euros? How is that going to contribute to more growth in Greece? And what about our presence here in Strasbourg? That costs EUR 200 million a year. How is that contributing to growth in Member States? It is not, of course. Nobody seriously believes that it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, the EU is not short of money. It just spends the money that it has very, very badly. Let us be quite clear about this. To meet your demands for more spending, virtually every contributing Member State is going to have to borrow that extra money. They are going to have to cut their public expenditure in order to send more money to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is completely unsustainable, it is unhelpful, and many Member States will not stand for it. Can you seriously, in all good conscience, ask those Member States to borrow that extra money to make cuts at home so that we can all spend more money here in Europe?</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time for the EU to spend the money that it already has better so that it creates growth in national economies. Instead of demanding yet more money, why not take the time to go through the existing budget, line by line, asking yourself whether this item of expenditure really results in more economic growth in Europe?</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not just Conservatives who are saying these things, Mr Swoboda. Even some of the socialists, I am pleased to say, are starting to see the light. The UK socialists actually want a cut in the budget, not just a freeze, which is Mr Cameron’s position. They voted in the House of Commons for a cut. And what about your great, latter-day socialist hero, President Hollande? He fought an election – remember that? – on an end to austerity. What is he saying now? He said last week that ‘we must be ready to do better by spending less’. That is the great socialist hero that you tell us is setting an example for the rest of Europe to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a word about new Member States. I think that enlargement has been one of the EU’s great success stories. I think that we have to accept that it will cost more money to support those Member States whose infrastructure was neglected in their communist past. That is why I believe that cohesion spending for new Member States should be maintained, even within an overall freeze or a cut in the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The way to do that is through budgetary reform, so that cohesion policy is limited to helping those countries that need it most. It is ridiculous that 40 % of current structural and cohesion funding goes to the EU’s richest countries. Countries like my own should be freed to support our poor regions ourselves without funnelling the money through the inefficient mechanism of the EU budget. I agree with the proposals put forward by our previous socialist government that cohesion policy should be repatriated to the richer Member States and that money only be used to fund the poorer Member States who deserve that spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am a bit of an optimist. I believe that a better budget – not just a bigger budget – is still achievable in the summit this week. I hope that Member States, with good grace and goodwill, will sit down and agree that we need better EU spending and not just more EU spending.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister Cameron heads to Brussels tomorrow – I think, on ‘Mission Impossible’ – but it is a remarkable debate, in that the European Union is talking about taking another trillion euros from European taxpayers, despite the fact that the accounts have not been signed off for 18 years in a row. If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to this line of argument, I find it very difficult to comprehend why you are working so hard to play down the value of the European Union. In my view, given the critical situation facing the European Union, what you are doing is simply engaging in smear tactics. I think it is unworthy of the House that speeches of this nature are being delivered here, when we have so little opportunity to rein you in.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that you are genuinely representing the interests of the citizens of the United Kingdom when you unleash this kind of attack on the European Union and ultimately indulge in nothing more than nationalistic rhetoric and smear tactics.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sorry, but from my perspective, the situation is far too serious for that. Today, I heard a speech by Mr Barroso which I could actually agree with in many respects for the first time, although I noted the undertone, namely that this was a speech born out of desperation. It was a speech delivered against the backdrop of what is likely to happen at the summit over the last few days. Will our political leaders finally realise that they are the ones who are responsible for the functioning and, indeed, the survival and the future of the European Union, and that they need to find some common ground and take the important decisions that are needed?</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that what has been submitted to us as the proposals for the budget, for the multiannual financial framework, will not help to strengthen the Union’s cohesion. The fact is that the current proposals are all based on drastic budget cuts. You are wrong when you say that what is being demanded here is an increase. Ultimately, what the Commission is additionally proposing merely balances out the extra tasks that have been assigned to the European Union and the challenges that the European Union is prepared to face.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately, no more money is being spent on administration or, indeed, on anything else, and it is quite simply a false argument to claim, as you do every time, that we need to make savings and focus on better spending first and foremost. If there are no resources available for better spending, your arguments fall wide of the mark.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me ask you this: how is the European Union meant to continue its campaign against poverty and social exclusion in future, for example, if the current proposals for the European budget for 2014-2020 already envisage a reduction in the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, as they most certainly do? In de facto terms, this is a cut. You cannot simply say that what happens during the crisis in the European Union leaves you cold, when more and more people are falling into abject poverty and their livelihoods are at risk. You cannot say, ‘Oh well, Great Britain is 10 times more important to us’ in the belief that you can prevent this crisis from impacting on the most deprived people in your country as well. At that point, you will find that you are relying on European solidarity once again: and that means the solidarity that you are dragging through the mud today. Let me make that very clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">I urge you – and I urge the German Government as well – to abandon this position, which erodes solidarity, and to give up these blocking tactics.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are several distinct questions apart from the obvious one of asking whether the EU should exist to spend any money at all. Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Member States make cuts so the Council’s logic is that cuts must be made to the EU budget and to the multiannual financial framework as well. Public opinion should know that the EU budget is always balanced without deficit. Member States make cuts in order to prevent or curtail deficit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, this budget is, all but for six percent of administrative costs, a growth budget. Funds for agriculture, cohesion, research and innovation and Erasmus, are destined to be returned to the Member States with added value. It is hypocritical to talk about growth and, at the same time, target these guaranteed growth funds. Those who at least speak of more Europe must see this antithesis. This is the first message for the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second message has to do with the image of Europe. All the disappointment of the European citizens because of the euro crisis cannot withstand an impasse on the budget in the multiannual financial framework. All governments that believe in Europe must realise that neither can the friends of cohesion get as much aid as they would have wished, nor can the net contributors insist on the cuts they initially planned. As always, consensus must prevail.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, Parliament reserves this right, provided for in the Treaties, if governments have abandoned any consideration of the common good fenced behind respective national interests.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is not really about money. The budget corresponds to only about 2 % of European public expenditure; it has been falling as a proportion of the Member States’ economies for years and contrary to what Mr Callanan and Mr Farage believe, the main criticism from the Court of Auditors is not against the European institutions but on how EU money is handled by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States who fight for cuts are the strongest ones; the ones who can pay if they feel that the Union is worth defending. No, it is not about money; this is a fight over the European model and the future of Europe. The reason why we Social Democrats, together with a huge majority of Parliament, defend the budget even in times of crisis is that the budget is the most significant expression of our fundamental policies. It is about European and even global solidarity. It is about creating a European added value and the basic idea that the growth we are striving for is not just any growth but is based on the principle of economic, social and environmental sustainability, is about green jobs and smart and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are fundamental things which will not be funded without the European Union. Let me mention just a few examples. Who will fund the completion of the single market including a modern cross-border transport energy and digital infrastructure if not the EU budget? Who will start breaking the vicious circle of austerity if we do not do it together? Who will provide the contribution to the innovative financial instruments including project bonds for funding investments? I mean, with all the restrictions on national budgets, on banks and financial institutions, only the European Union can do it. How can we respect our commitment to funding the Millennium Development Goals if not through the EU budget?</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obvious that Member States under pressure will not even fulfil their commitments to allocate 0.7 % of GNI to development aid. We need the European Union for that. Against the background of new devastating research on the effects of climate change no Member State is big enough to mitigate climate change on its own. We must do it together and the European Union is the major global actor in this field. Even if some of us do not like common agricultural policies we must ask: who will finance the greening of agriculture and the greening of fisheries and the more sustainable development of those policies if we do not do it together? So this is not about money; it is about giving the European Union the chance to finally realise the role we all agreed on in the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

They clearly should have, because we will not have a railway that links them to the rest of Europe if there is no money in the Connecting Europe facility.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, since the Treaty of Rome, Europe’s story has continued unabated. It is therefore up to all of us to continue to move forward. However, the budgetary proposals from the Cypriot Presidency and the President of the Council for the period 2014-2020 will do nothing but stop this progress in its tracks and backpedal, which would be disastrous for our future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In light of the crisis, Parliament proposed maintaining the 2007-2013 budget amounts, only increasing them for the foreseeable effects of the new elements in the next budget period: accession of a 28th Member States and application of the new EU competences following on from the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission proposed a lower amount, based on the current budget amounts, arguing that the savings imposed by the economic situation had to be used to finance the extension of the Union’s tasks. That proposal is compatible with the European idea, given that we have to tighten our belts because of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the proposals by the Cypriot Presidency and then Mr Herman Van Rompuy completely contradict the very principle of moving forward with European integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This conciliation is Eurosceptic because in the Council there is a political surrender to the blackmail of the most Eurosceptic countries. Our position in this Parliament is simple, however. Since Mr Cameron is threatening to use his right of veto, we would point out that the European Parliament also has a right of veto in fine on the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will not hesitate to ask our parliamentary colleagues to use that right of veto to obstruct the Council’s political resignation. Negotiations are starting.

The article is entitled ‘The European Parliament pours more money into celebrating itself’ and it appeared two days ago. So if anyone here wants to talk about the budget, it should first of all be the European Parliament which sets an example and shows that it knows how to make savings, when necessary.</p>

Perhaps we think we are a little bit like the American Congress? You can see that, if we take these steps, money will be saved. This is what we are talking about when we say we want better spending.

The budget is about choices, in particular policy choices. We want choices that involve cohesion and solidarity. Although the following issues have already been mentioned several times, they are worth repeating: what will become of the Erasmus Programme? What will become of scientific research? What will become of investment to create jobs, if the Council’s proposal is adopted? What will become of the funds to support the poorest and most vulnerable in Europe? I must also ask: where in all this is the courage to resolutely implement a financial transactions tax? Where is the courage to ditch economic macro-conditionality and the restrictions of the Fiscal Compact? At a time when we need more and better Europe, our governments are effectively digging the grave of the Europe that they claim to be defending. For the sake of the present and future, the citizens of Europe will never forgive us if this Parliament and the Commission yield to this Council proposal.</p>

That decision is rightly theirs too, it is not a decision for Parliament or the Commission. The Member States foot the bills, so they also take the decisions. It is important to reiterate that, as most of those here forget it sometimes. I would like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Mavroyiannis, who has made a good start on expenditure restraint.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My country, the Netherlands, wants to do more though and is prepared to use its veto if more substantial cuts are not made to the proposed multiannual budget. Similar messages are coming out from the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Austria. Luckily we have that veto, because if the citizens were left to the mercy of the Commission and Parliament, this unbridled spending of their money would simply carry on night and day. The proposals made by Mr Mavroyiannis and Mr Van Rompuy are a start, but we could shave several tens of billions more off the budget. The situation where the north-west pays and the south-east squanders the money must be consigned to the past. This completely misplaced solidarity must stop as soon as possible. Certain countries clearly need to learn that when it comes to budgets it is not about solidarity, but solidity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On another point, Mr Swoboda, not a cent more should go to Gaza and Hamas, whose aim is to destroy Israel. Let the government of Gaza look after its own people for once, instead of European citizens having to pay for the rockets that threaten that state’s independence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I would like to reaffirm the contents of the interim report presented by Mr Kalfin and myself, as rapporteurs, in October, which was supported by an extremely large majority in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Building on the Cyprus Presidency’s negotiating boxes, President Van Rompuy has now presented a negotiating box, so we have some movement, but in a direction which follows the Council’s logic, namely that further cuts are the simplest and the only solution, without sufficient regard for the consequences and without adequate consideration of the proposals that we have made. This is a shame, to say the least, and is increasingly looking like a missed opportunity for an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me clarify, if I may: we are in favour of better spending as well. We are in favour of structural reforms and, in the interim report, we make very specific proposals on this issue, because it is essential to talk about synergies and the avoidance of duplication in our work, but it is also essential to discuss aspects of subsidiarity intensively and try to establish clarity. Unfortunately, though, there are some Member States that regard the European budget as nothing but a cancerous tumour. As a result, many of the accusations being made lack any substance or rationale, and this is poisoning everything. If the European budget for 2008-2013 increased by 1.95 % annually, then we are doing very well: the figure for Germany was close to 2.5 % per annum, for France, it was almost 2.8 %, the figure for the Netherlands was 2.8 %, for Austria it was almost 3 %, Sweden was close to 2.9 %, and 2.5 % for the United Kingdom. We can certainly hold our own in the competition for stability and serious budget policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, you have delivered a good speech, but I urge you to remain steadfast in the meeting with the European Council. Do not let them soften you up! I would like to voice a plea to the European Council. Please do not waste this opportunity to make proposals to Parliament that we can support with an absolute majority. Please give the Cypriot Presidency an adequate and flexible negotiating mandate so that we can achieve a sensible result by the end of the year, and by that I mean a result which takes our priorities on board.

      <p sl="bg">I believe that Parliament’s position is very clear as it was approved by almost 80 % of our colleagues at our October part-session. That position has nothing in common with what was subsequently proposed by the Presidency, and with Mr Van Rompuy’s position in particular. It is unacceptable for the European Parliament in its present form. Once again we are witnessing the European Council turning the discussion on the budget into an exercise in accounting, into a zero-sum game in which one has to win and another has to lose. This is not what the European budget is about. What Parliament is fighting for is an instrument for policies that are already determined. Who has determined these policies? The European Council itself. The same leaders who are now refusing to provide the finances to implement them. Who took the decision in June for a Compact for Growth and Jobs, which was supposed to be supported with EUR 150 billion? European leaders. Who took the decision and told young people that they will have more opportunities for free movement and training in Europe? European leaders. Who is promising developing countries that if they open their markets they will receive additional assistance? European leaders. Who is committing to fighting climate change? European leaders. We have made enough commitments. Their implementation, however, requires the corresponding budget. Therefore, when we talk about the budget we have to talk about the policies that have already been decided.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Here the English Conservatives, our colleagues, are concerned about English taxpayers and rightly so. Do they tell British taxpayers, however, how much English universities earn from the mobility of young people? How much English businesses gain from the common market, from common infrastructure? How many British researchers and scientists take part in common European projects? How many British companies spend public investment from the European budget? This is the other side of the truth that taxpayers should also be told. Let us really ask our regions, those in the developed, in the less developed, and in the most under-developed regions; if there are no European funds there are no public investments. That is a fact. If we limit them even further that would mean that the European budget does not solve the economic crisis but actually aggravates it. We do not want the European budget to be a procyclical measure. Furthermore, Parliament is equally opposed to it, i.e. to the macroeconomic conditionality that some Member States seek. Let us ask the non-governmental organisations working in the developing countries how many jobs are created in Europe and how much European companies themselves profit from the assistance for growth we give to developing countries. That is the other side of the coin.</p>

In the previous period and in the period we are in now, we have always made very clear agreements with the Council on better implementation of the budget.

It is very much reduced; it is certainly better than the British proposal, but in relation to the Commission proposal, it is lower in all cases, even though – as we heard – the European budget only represents 2 % of the Member States’ spending. Is proposing that they give even less really going to take the strain off the national budgets? By giving less, will the national budgets really be better off?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course not! It is far from being the case, and will be even less so when we make progress on own resources. In this case, the Council will have to explain to the European citizens what projects can be supported when we have to make cuts across the board. It will have to explain that the Europe 2020 strategy is perhaps only window dressing, that research and innovation are a luxury, that economic regeneration in our regions will have to cope with fewer resources for cohesion. Good luck explaining all of that!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Good luck, too, explaining to the Europeans who still believe in the European project that that is how we are going to finance solidarity with the East, which we must do. Good luck explaining how we are going to finance solidarity with southern Europe, which we must do. Good luck to the net contributors as well! Do you think that the northern countries will behave better because of this reduction? Of course they will not. They all have an interest in seeing an improvement in the economies of their neighbouring countries. Indeed, it seems that British employers and European employers realised this at the eleventh hour.</p>

I am talking, here, about the end to VAT eligibility, about macro-economic conditionality, which will determine the absorption of EU funding. I am talking about capping, about the system of net corrections for projects, which means that, contrary to what is stated in the current financial perspective, future projects not subject to European Union supervision will be rejected by Brussels and have their funding returned to the EU.</p>

Why do we cast doubt on our credibility and the Union’s undertakings towards its partners? If we do not, despite all the difficulties, support these exceptional projects now, it may be that we shall never take the vital step, never have the opportunity again. In my view, ITER, GMES and Galileo might make a contribution to solving the energy problems in Europe and have the potential to provide much needed employment.

Where is the consistency, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, between the measures announced in July on employment and growth, those great calls for hope and for the future of the EU that we heard from the Council, and this sudden violence done in the name of realism, aiming for mere survival? With these figures and these cuts how can we implement cohesion and the agricultural reforms in terms of concrete actions?</p>
      <p sl="it">These are sincere questions that require a clear and honest answer, because there is evidence here of a type of institutional schizophrenia that Parliament and the citizens can no longer tolerate. Parliament wants consistency and credibility. The very first criticism that can be levelled is that the budget just does not add up. So much for growth and investment: this is the 2008 budget over again! Of course it must be conceded that Mr Van Rompuy, in heading 1a, overturns the quite scandalous suggestion by Cyprus. He also recognises the essential role of the budget in offering support to growth in some sectors, additional to the support offered by the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">But growth and innovation – clearly – should not be achieved at the expense of other sectors that also contribute to ‘growth’ and ‘employment’, such as cohesion policy, but also agricultural policy, which has created jobs and is ever more focused on innovation and protection of rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">‘Growth’ and ‘employment’ also mean culture, training, the transnational networks, the Connecting Europe Facility, as well as solidarity and international development, human rights in the world and our contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What we are seeing however is the usual Council spectacle: no vision, no leadership, a Babel of conflicting and competing national interests, an inextricable tangle of vetoes, aspirations and general discontent. Unfortunately what is mainly missing is Europe!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, astonishingly after last week’s budget vote in Westminster, we now discover that Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg are the real UK champions of larger EU spending. Why? Because our socialists, our Scottish Nationalists and our Green colleagues engaged in a crass act of political cross-dressing by joining the Eurosceptic UKIP camp and voting for deeper cuts in that vote. Can I say to them I think you need to be careful who you climb into bed with? You could be the ushers who unwittingly took the UK through the exit door.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Van Rompuy budget proposals take us in the right direction. They reflect the tough economic times our constituents are facing on a daily basis and they could be the basis of an agreement. However, I am deeply disappointed at Mr Van Rompuy’s plans reduce Parliament’s flexibility to manage the budget more effectively. Parliament has made it crystal clear to the Council that a tougher budget must go hand in hand with greater flexibility, not less, a genuine mid-term review and prioritising spending on the EU 2020 objectives. Failure to deliver on that agenda will surely lead to rejection in this House.</p>

Those are the kind of issues that are the challenge for the future and our budget is really needed for that. For innovation, for energy infrastructure, for agriculture, for the Structural Fund, where we invest in energy-saving, in sustainable energy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to draw attention to two important and specific aspects of the multiannual financial framework: funding the decommissioning of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant and support for farmers in the Baltic States. As we meet here today in Strasbourg, Baltic farmers who have gathered for a meeting in Brussels say that Europe is insulting us and taking us for fools by allocating us payments that are four times lower. How long can this go on? We talk about a level playing field in all resolutions and directives so let us finally create one.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Lithuania undertook to decommission the nuclear power plant and has done so. The European Union undertook to finance its decommissioning but has not done this fully. Three times less money than is needed is to be earmarked for the decommissioning of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant until 2017, while the further decommissioning, which may last until 2029 at the earliest, is not to be financed. I would like to stress that this is clear backsliding from the Treaty of Accession and the provisions contained in its Protocol No 4.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard some very clever speeches today, and some speeches that rightly explain why we, the European Parliament, and Europe need a specific amount of money. All the various tasks on the agenda have also been correctly and precisely identified. On the other hand, there is this competition, as I think Mr Swoboda called it, among the Member States to see who can save the most. I am not entirely sure whether this is the right way forward or the right kind of rhetoric at this difficult, indeed critical time. I could stand here and give a speech explaining why all this is important. However, I believe that we also have a responsibility to consider how we can find some common ground. What is the best way of moving forward so that we can reach an agreement, ideally in the next few days? The fact is that if European policy-makers fail to reach agreement at such a critical time, this will not only determine whether we have enough funds flowing into our budget. It will also have a wider impact on the markets, politics, and other countries. That is why I believe there is no alternative: we must give some thought to the steps that we need to take to move towards some common ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Schulz said at the start that Parliament is showing movement on this issue and will continue to do so. It was a brief comment but in my view, it was a very clever one. The resolution before us shows that we are already thinking about how we can move towards common ground. It is not the case that all our spending in every area is essential and must be maintained at all costs. As with the national parliaments, there is bound to be some leeway. Questions like ‘how much’ and ‘which items’ are the really interesting questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would prefer not to argue about the amount of money we receive and whether this should be a bit more or a bit less. I would prefer to discuss which tasks should be on the agenda and how much money we will need for them. Which tasks could be dispensed with, perhaps? Which processes can we look at critically? Is it always the right way forward for the stakeholders concerned – I am thinking of the agricultural sector, for example – if we simply hand out more cash and impose more conditions? It might, perhaps, be more sensible to impose fewer conditions, for this could result in more sparing use of funds in one area or another as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">A compromise means that both sides have to show some movement. We will consider where we can make some concessions. It is not just about austerity in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the extraordinary meeting of the European Council is now imminent and we are talking ourselves to a standstill in an effort to achieve harmony. The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced.</p>
      <p sl="de">To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children</p>
      <p sl="de">The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling!</p>

Once again, we are becoming embroiled in discussions over whether there should be 5 % more or 5 % less for agricultural subsidies and essential investment in research and development, instead of talking about the priorities and where the European Union should be going in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fundamental problem is becoming increasingly obvious. Our Member States are all egotists. The question is always: ‘What can I get from the European budget?’, not ‘What can I contribute in terms of added value to this budget?’. Instead of shared European interests, the EU is dominated by 27 sets of national interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unless we manage to formulate some shared interests for the European Union, we will set the course for its ultimate demise. That is something that no rational Member of this House could possibly want. The multiannual financial framework must be seen as an opportunity to define these European interests.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like us to recall what the European Union budget really is. The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error.</p>
      <p sl="it">Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets.</p>

      <p sl="fr">That is why, like other Members – and I say this straight away to President Barroso – we cannot accept the Commission’s proposal as a ceiling; it is the absolute lowest level to which the European Parliament could sink.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I shall begin by addressing the statement made by Mr Mavroyiannis, on behalf of the European Council and the Cypriot Presidency, in which he said that we were living in difficult times, in times of crisis, and that it was impossible to disregard this crisis when planning the European Union budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yes, it is an unquestionable fact that we are facing a crisis. However, many – the vast majority – would say that, if we are going to survive this crisis, we will not do it alone. We must act together, we must achieve a synergy effect, we must strengthen our Union, we must have more Europe in order to be able to tackle the crisis effectively. I would point out to Mr Mavroyiannis that we cannot have more Europe or a stronger European Union for less money. That is simply not possible. Mr Kasoulides made this point earlier, as did the Polish Prime Minister at the European People’s Party Congress in Bucharest. More Europe means more money. How should that money be spent? President Barroso has talked about that. The EU budget is an investment budget that can deliver more jobs and economic growth and help those areas lagging behind, in particular the new Member States – countries like Poland. Poland serves as an example of just how effectively this money can be used; of how European assistance can generate economic growth and jobs and help the European economy – not only the Polish economy, but the European economy as well. That is why I call on Mr Mavroyiannis (and, through him, on President Van Rompuy) to accept that there is no more room for cuts. Meanwhile, I would like to congratulate President Barroso on his outstanding speech today and to urge him to defend the budget presented by the Commission – a good budget – with the same passion, determination and persistence at the summit tomorrow and the day after.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is obvious that we need a budget fit for purpose – a budget for the future rather than the past – and that does mean big changes. It means prioritising spending on areas strengthening innovation, jobs and growth, and ensuring we tackle the blight of unemployment across Europe, particularly for our young people. We have a tragedy unfolding and we must act to give them hope for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that Europe needs change – economic and political change – but it is difficult to argue for change whilst at the same time wielding phantom vetoes and smashing alliances. All that achieves is frustration and a lack of credibility, even amongst our friends, undermining our position in Europe and ultimately damaging, not just those alliances, but the British interest too. Is that really what David Cameron wants? Does he really want to relegate Britain to the second division? Well, if that is what he wants, he has almost achieved it; and for what? Does he really think that it is in the British interest? Of course he does not, but rather he is fearful of taking on those in his party who would head us to the exit door. We can only make the changes we want by being at the table, playing a full part in decision-making and working with others to achieve our aims. That, Mr Cameron, is what you need to do if you really want to ensure a better future for us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, can I say to Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Lyon – it is a shame that Mr Verhofstadt has gone – that you seem to have selective memory loss. Talk about hypocrisy.

      <p sl="fr">I, therefore, believe that our Parliament has two battles ahead of it: the first is to obtain a budget that responds to the challenges, which are enormous in the current situation; the second – which is at least as important – is to ensure that in future the European budget is no longer a simple variable in the adjustments of the national budgets.

      <p sl="es">Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach.</p>
      <p sl="es">In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty.</p>

The European Union does not have a deficit or public debt, yet this budget makes it impossible to fulfil the ambitions laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. It is unfair, it is completely unsupportive, it will increase inequalities and it reflects European fatigue.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is bad news for the cohesion policy and, in particular, for the so-called transition regions. It is bad news for the future of the common agricultural policy, which is the heart and soul of the European project and which has an economic, a social and an environmental dimension. However, without money and without resources, not only can there be no common agricultural policy, there can be no reform of it either.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, this is the first time that the multiannual financial framework (MFF) has been debated in accordance with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. Unfortunately, in my opinion, these have caused difficulty and diminished the democratic dimension of the budget adoption. The MFF approval procedure and codecision oppose rather than complement one another.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Council does not respect the Treaty and proposes elements that should be subject to codecision. The Council and the European Parliament became blocked in the codecision procedure as there were no negotiations on the resources needed to implement European policies. The rotating European Council Presidency submitted one proposal and the President of the Council of the European Union another. This state of affairs and these proposals both undermine the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this period of crisis, the Member States are increasing national budget allocations for investment and job creation. This must be mirrored in the European budget, 94 % of which is allocated for investment. The Member States that are net contributors know that one euro invested in one region of Europe will bring benefits in other regions of the Union. Given that public funds were used for the financial bailout, public funds must also be used to support European policies that stimulate economic growth and job creation, and, by implication, financial prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Council of the European Union adopted the Europe 2020 strategy with national and EU targets. The same Council must also ensure an adequate budget to meet these targets.

So too, now, the planned large-scale reductions in the Union’s budget would cause further deterioration and widen the development gap. Some policy priorities need to be considered: it is important that the resources in the European Social Fund remain intact so that we can mitigate the serious social and labour market impact of the crisis. We must abide by our values and ensure that there are resources for common refugee policy, for integration of migrants, for supporting fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination. This is all about making a choice: either we put the principle of solidarity into practice and bridge the development gap, or we let the development gap widen further.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, except for a few very odd colleagues, I would be surprised if my fellow Members of the European Parliament were satisfied today. In 2011, most of them voted in favour of a draft financial perspective, submitted after a year of budgetary work, which took into account Europe’s traditional policies and new policies, and which provided adequate financing for the European agenda for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Like Parliament, the Commission then presented a very adequate, if less ambitious, proposal, which at that stage took into account the Member States’ wish to reduce as far as possible their national contribution to the common budget. After that, the proposals from Cyprus and Mr Van Rompuy went from bad to worse, with a noticeable downward trend.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now, just as the European Council is beginning, we are EUR 100 billion below the European Parliament’s proposal and EUR 75 billion below the Commission’s proposal. With such a precedent, the multiannual financial framework that might emerge from Brussels this week is going to reflect some very worrying realities.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council believes that the EU budget is a financial burden, not an instrument of economic policy. The Council refuses to analyse EU spending from the perspective of its European added value. That added value does not exist with this proposal. The Council is sacrificing agriculture and the cohesion policy to a simple calculation of the national net balances. The Horizon 2020 programme will again be worthless without sufficient funding: it will follow the path of the Lisbon strategy. With this proposal, the Council is giving in to the pressure of one Member State whose ambition is outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We hope that, with this precedent, the Council will be capable of changing its misguided strategy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I wish to stress that the European Parliament and the European Commission are united in protecting the interests of the European citizens, by providing a budget focused on development and investment, and I welcome the contribution of the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As rapporteur for the report on the Cohesion Fund, I must say that the logic behind some of the statements and the proposal of President Van Rompuy is simply shocking. On the one hand, he states that the cohesion policy aims to reduce disparities, but in his proposals, we note the following, which contradict this: a substantial reduction in the cohesion budget, a reduction in the cofinancing rates for the least developed regions of the European Union and, more surprisingly, punishment of the regions with a weaker absorption rate, and, alongside all these, the macroeconomic conditionalities constantly opposed by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Mr Van Rompuy and the Council must understand that we cannot forgo the word ‘solidarity’ in Europe and that the European Union cannot exist with a rich, selfish centre and a poor periphery. I would like to remind President Van Rompuy about the role of the cohesion policy and, more importantly, the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator. If the Council returns the same unacceptable proposal, the European Parliament will most certainly reject this deeply anti-European budget.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the European Union is very evident today, but it is equally evident that cohesion policy is one of the European Union’s success stories. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Reducing cohesion support would only make matters worse because it would aggravate economic and social tensions, further undermine political stability and reduce confidence in the institutions of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me to cite the example of Hungary, Mr President. Over the past two and a half years the Hungarian government and Hungarian citizens have made strenuous efforts to ensure that the country can at last free itself from the excessive deficit procedure and avoid the risk of having its cohesion funds suspended. As the European Commission’s recent country report confirms, the Hungarian government’s successful crisis management programme has enabled Hungary, for the first time since its accession to the EU, to keep its budget deficit below 3 % for three years running. This result is a success both for the Hungarian people and for Europe. Hungary can at last escape from the blind alley down which previous governments had led it. To do this, however, it also needs the cohesion resources.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the key to Europe’s success is solidarity, and the most successful instrument for solidarity to date is quite clearly cohesion policy. Let us preserve it and look after it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, we ask European agriculture to provide our citizens with plentiful food at affordable prices and meeting the highest quality standards in the world. We also ask our farmers to work to protect the environment, biodiversity, and water and soil quality, and to lock up carbon and combat climate change. Agriculture is irreplaceable in terms of achieving these goals. We additionally ask our farmers to operate in a context of international competition which is fierce and unfair.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore consider that this latest agricultural budget proposal cannot be for real, and even represents a provocation. We have agreed to work based on the Commission proposal, which is 12 % lower than the current budget in real terms, despite the European Parliament having advocated a higher amount by an overwhelming majority.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Parliament has clearly stated its position on the multiannual financial framework. Its position is directly opposed to that of the Bureau and to President Van Rompuy’s text. In a time of crisis and austerity programmes in the Member States, the EU multiannual budget may prove to be simultaneously realistic and ambitious, supporting the 2020 strategy, employment, student mobility, research and science, and hence Europe’s position in an extremely competitive world. Mr President, anyone who sets targets must also find the means to achieve them. How can the European leadership deceive itself? How can it adopt an attitude that supports a return to inward-looking nationalism? The European budget must express not only solidarity but also the preservation of the European perspective, because Europe cannot advance into the future on autopilot. Europe needs new endeavours, serious corrections to the mistaken choices of the past, and a genuine unity. Community funding needs to be coordinated at the level of objectives and, therefore, at the level of results. Whether some people like it or not, Europe, whatever its shortcomings, cannot become just a free trade area. A fair compromise, then, on the issue of the multiannual budget will give European citizens a breathing space, because they need real solidarity. The Council must back down immediately and accept the positions expressed today in Parliament, and also those of the Commission, because both bodies are willing to reach a fair compromise for the sake of the citizens, which will strengthen the values of the European Union.</p>

It is being conducted with half-truths and hostile images. It is weakening the European Union and is unworthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is a project that is intended to overcome nationalism, and we were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for overcoming nationalism and national egotism and for putting shared responsibility first, ahead of its individual parts.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore appeal to the heads of state and government to help make this an objective debate, to focus on the real issues on the agenda, not on percentages, to exercise responsibility as a Community instead of operating with hostile images, and to take responsibility for our continent’s future, instead of wielding the veto.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we want, no more and no less, is to be able to honour our pledges, fulfil our goals and implement Community projects. To that end, we need money, and we need the amount stated, no more and no less. It is about credibility. For every cut that is made, our citizens pick up the tab, because there will be fewer infrastructure projects, less growth and employment, less education and research, and less rural development.

      <p sl="bg">The Council’s proposal for reducing cohesion policy funds and the introduction of all kinds of obstacles to utilising these funds are illogical and unacceptable. What is the point, when we need growth in Europe, of freezing or even reducing the size of an efficient investment instrument complementing national efforts at a time when the objective is to complete the single market and to increase the competitiveness of all European regions to the North, to the South, to the East and to the West? I believe that it is cohesion policy itself that would get us out of this real, but also psychological, crisis. What is the point in crippling it? What is the point in dividing into friends of cohesion policy and friends of good spending? They both go together. There are government leaders who bravely announce that the multiannual financial framework must be frozen until 2020. Would they have the same courage to declare before their electorate that they will also freeze their national budgets until 2020? Of course it is more popular and more populist to cripple the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We declare that we want growth and jobs, a competitive economy, scientific research and innovations, and yet we purposefully limit the very instruments that achieve them. We are therefore guaranteeing the certain failure of the Europe 2020 objectives, which was, in fact, what happened with the Lisbon Strategy. Do we want to allow it to happen again? The world around us is not waiting. Ladies and gentlemen, government leaders, do not leave the central pillar of solidarity in the European Union, namely the cohesion policy, in such a state that it is unable to fulfil its objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I will be very brief because, in my opinion, this is essentially a policy issue and not a financial issue. The question to be asked is therefore whether we want the European Union to make the difference in this crisis situation or whether we want to aggravate the crisis. Most of the European countries are currently making huge efforts in their public finances so that they can exit the crisis in a competitive position enabling the European Union and its countries to truly compete on a global level. However, it is clear that, without investment, there can be no growth and no exit from this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the European Union insists on these radical cuts, particularly in cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy, those countries which are making a huge effort will not grow. As a result, this plan for the European Union, which we have accepted in every country, namely good accounts with prospects of growth and competitiveness, will fail. The only substantial instrument available to achieve this goal is precisely the multiannual financial framework. As a result, if we want the European Union to succeed and its policy to stand as an example to other countries, we must secure the right budget for the financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Historically, democracy has come about as a result of taxes being approved by the representatives of those who pay them and who benefit from the policies they finance. This approval is given by a public vote after a public debate. What do we see now? Europe has no taxes. It is begging its members for charity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, there will be a debate in the European Council, but it will not be a public debate and it will not be a European debate. None of the 28 members has to report back to the 500 million citizens of Europe. Each of them will negotiate to minimise its own contribution to the common budget and maximise the money it gets back in return. That is when they will prove to be the most generous with other people’s money.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to thank Members of this House for this debate. I think it has shown very clearly that you really represent European citizens. We participated in many rounds of negotiations. It is not only the two major EU institutions which support the proposal for a modern and a good European budget, but also scientists, students, businessmen and industrialists support a modern European budget. Therefore I think the debate today was very important because it reconfirms this attitude.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please allow me to react to some of the myths, which I heard again this morning and which are so misleading and so damaging to the European image.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the notion that national budgets are being cut. There are cuts only in the five Member States which are on the programme. So what is being cut in the Member States? Excessive deficits. I think we have to speak about the figures but, to be fair to each other, we have to use them correctly. I think that Mr Böge in his statement was very precise about that. The budgets in 22 Member States are actually growing.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look at budget developments over the longer period, from 2000 to 2011, only two Member States have slower-growing budgets than the EU budget. If we take the example of the UK, in that case the budget grew twice as fast as the budget of the European Union. And let us remind ourselves that in 2000 there were only 15 of us. Now we are 27 and very soon we will be 28.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then of course there is the issue of errors. I think that it is very important that we do not confuse errors with fraud or abuse. Only 0.2 % of the EU budget is actually investigated and you know very well that the Commission has clean books and a clean budget. Where is there a problem? With improper spending in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore I am very glad that yesterday in the General Affairs Council we approved the new approach to the way in which we control and spend the EU budget. We are introducing the possibility of net corrections, so I believe that we should also increase the discipline in how the money is spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to some of the ridiculous projects which have been mentioned here, let us not assume that they are automatically paid for. More than EUR 1.5 billion worth of projects are very carefully studied and we do not pay for anything which is not in accordance with EU laws and EU rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the EU staff – and I have had quite intense discussions on this over the last couple of weeks – we have 55 000 EU officials, which include those in the Council, the European Parliament, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the European External Action Service, delegations abroad, agencies and the two Committees we have in Brussels. So how does this compare with the administrations abroad? They are comparable with the City Council in Birmingham or the City Council of Paris.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can we compare the size of the staff of the Commission? I had a discussion on this yesterday with my British friends. One department in the UK, the Department for Public Works and Pensions, is three times bigger than the whole Commission with 98 000 people. Of course we can distinguish the roles of the civil servants in this or that institution, but the fact is that this is one department for one country and we have a Commission which has to serve, already now, 28 countries. Therefore I think we have to keep the figures in proportion.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the issue of pensions, the first thing to say is that EU officials are paying the highest contribution rates in Europe and they are, of course, paying towards their pensions in a system which was developed and proposed by the Member States. They are paying the pensions into the EU budget under the promise that when they reach pensionable age they will get their pension. If there were a pension fund – it was abolished by the Member States – today we would have a pension fund of EUR 35 billion to cover future pensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the argument that we did not react to austerity, here again I would like to remind Members that, since 2009, the Commission has followed zero growth with regard to staffing. How have we reacted to austerity? We continued with a proposal of a five % cut with a staff which will have to cover this cut by longer working hours – which would be among the longest in the European Union – without a pay adjustment. We have reacted by introducing the possibility for possibly the longest working life in the EU, namely introducing a pension age of 65 with the possibility to work to 67 and the European Parliament is suggesting 70. Is this not – I would say – a reaction to austerity? I think it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that we are under time constraints, so allow me to conclude by saying that we very much value your support. We are of course ready to engage and we will look for the compromise. But you will also understand that we have to fight for Europe, for the citizens and for a good modern EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you very much for this exchange of views. I know it is only by working together that we will deliver a good and sustainable budget for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have taken note of the positions expressed during this debate; we are going to convey them to the President of the European Council and through the Council to our Heads of State and Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Far be it for me to challenge or question the intentions of MEPs, albeit diverse and conflicting at times, or for that matter the intentions of this House as a whole. I was particularly heartened about the reminder of the role of the EU budget and the role of Europe in the world and of Heading 4, because indeed we do not live in a glass house.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, an agreement on the MFF can only be the synthesis of a shared vision and ambition considering the dire economic realities we are facing. Certainly we should not lower the level of ambition in a way which would deprive us of the means to move forward together honouring our values: quality of life, social cohesion, a redefinition of the notion of modernity and what kind of competitiveness we want; what kind of society we want; what kind of community we want.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the antithesis mentioned by my mentor, Mr Kasoulides, real as it is, there might also be differing views on how to best achieve agreed and coordinated, sought-after results. Nobody in the Council questions Erasmus, help for SMEs, culture, education, research and development. Even with the proposed reductions, there is a substantial increase in comparison with the current period.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do not come with a butcher’s cleaver to cut because we enjoy cutting. It is a difficult and painful situation. Let us credit each other with good intentions. Let us credit each other with being good Europeans even if we disagree on the role, the scope and the ambit of the European Union and what should be done at the European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us try together – but please in a pragmatic way with respect and dignity – to move the limits of what is possible and the quality of our spending, of our policies, of our actions, of our programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some tell us that we are a weak Presidency because we have upheld these values. We will not change. We will continue to have the same ethical approach assuming fully our responsibility with modesty yet ambition; trying to bring about a big catalyst of change. However, we do not force or impose. This is our role; we are honest brokers. This is our mission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please be conscious that when Member States contributing more than two-thirds of the budget and representing more than half of the EU population are asking for reductions, we cannot just ignore them. What we need is just more persuasion. This is the only way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed we all – Member States and of course this House as well – have the right of veto. But veto is just the right to pull the plug from the bottom of the boat we are all in, with the certainty that the boat will sink. Therefore, let us replace the threat of veto and the vicious circle with a virtuous one and embark on this by definition cathartic exercise, sticking together in adversity and coming out of it stronger and better off and, at the end of the day, bequeathing a better Europe to future generations.</p>

However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there has been a great deal of talk here today about pragmatism and the need to adapt to real-world conditions. Let me make one thing clear: pragmatism and real-world conditions require a larger budget for the European Union, especially for the programmes to combat poverty and social exclusion. It is not acceptable that even the EUR 2.5 billion earmarked for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived could be further reduced by the Member States to just EUR 2 billion or even rejected outright. We must recognise that due to the crisis, the situation of many people in the Member States has worsened and we all have a responsibility to act in solidarity here. That must the first priority for the negotiations next week as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">The prerequisite, from my perspective, is that the Council finally accepts that the EUR 9 billion shortfall in the 2012 budget should be signed off and not carried forward to next year, and that no further shortfalls from 2012 should be carried forward to the next Financial Framework, as this would further reduce the total amount available.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me remind you of the history of this. It is not just Mr Cameron that is calling for a budget freeze. Two years ago six Member States signed the same letter as he did looking for a budget freeze and it is now of course only the socialists, the UK socialists, who are calling for a budget cut. Mr Cameron’s position is still for a budget freeze if he can achieve it.</p>

Yesterday, British companies in the United Kingdom spoke out in public and demanded movement from Mr Cameron.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much for the publicity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Farage has talked the whole morning about salaries and the biggest waste of money. Well, colleagues, what I think is the biggest waste of money in the European Union today is the salary we are all paying to Mr Farage – that is the biggest waste of money!</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Farage, let us be honest about it. You are a member of the Committee on Fisheries, for example, and you are never there, never! In 2011, no attendance. In 2012, no attendance. It is fantastic what you are doing. You come here saying that the salaries that are paid are a scandal, and you pay yourself a salary without doing any work in your own committee: that is the reality of the European Union today.</p>

      <p sl="de">We know that Mr Alain Lamassoure is right. This Union, if it wants to become a real federal union, needs own resources; it needs in fact its own income, and that is the big battle now. We shall do it together and, if necessary, without you, Mr Farage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not want to deal with the issue of Mr Farage at this point. My comments concern a gentleman who has much more responsibility but who is not present in the chamber today; indeed, he is conspicuous by his absence at so many of our sittings. This gentleman has made a budget proposal and yet he is not willing to come here to defend it. Why is Mr Van Rompuy absent? I have nothing against Mr Mavroyiannis. He is a very pleasant and patient person, but Mr Van Rompuy should be here to defend his budget and his budget cuts. That is important, and would be a crucial debate!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am sure that as always, you will present our views very effectively but it would be very useful to have a direct confrontation for once.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second and final comment is this. I know that many leaders and governments are now spreading the rumour that failure to reach agreement at the summit is a crisis for Europe. Let me say this: an agreement on the wrong terms is a crisis for Europe. A budget which cannot fulfil the tasks the EU has set itself is a crisis for Europe. A budget that we cannot endorse is a crisis for Europe. The heads of state and government should not constantly act as if their failure to reach agreement would precipitate a crisis. The crisis will occur if the basis for their agreement is the wrong one, meaning that we cannot fulfil our agenda. I already see one threat looming – and I would like to give you my backing once again, Mr President, also in your statements to the Council – namely that some countries will be mollified by the funding for agriculture and others by the cohesion funding, leaving no room in the European budget for growth and reforms. The danger is that all the countries and heads of government who want an efficient budget, a budget for growth and better spending will be bypassed and what we are left with is less spending. That is something that we cannot accept. That is not a course that will benefit Europe, and we must reject it. We must also send out a clear message that this type of budget will not secure the approval of the majority of Members of this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has shown that the large majority of the House is united and consistently supports the resolution on the interim report from October. We are willing to compromise. However, there are limits to our willingness to compromise. Of course, we know that shortfalls in the management of the European budget must be resolutely addressed by the Commission and the Member States. We must get this under control. We want to achieve a result in the time available, but we do not want a result at any price. Quality must take precedence over timetabling.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make it very clear at this juncture that the proposal made by Mr Van Rompuy, as a concept, is certainly not capable of securing majority support in the House.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">More far-reaching ideas that apparently exist, which involve further cuts and reductions in programmes that offer European added value, are doomed to failure. Nor is it acceptable to say that we will achieve reductions of EUR 75 billion +/– 25 or whatever, and a few months later we come along with a proposal for a euro-facility. If this is the way forward and is under discussion, then in the interests of the unity of the European budget, it should be included in the European budget. Anything else would outsource the core of the European Union and ultimately weaken it. That is not something that any of us can seriously want.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore add my own voice to Mr Swoboda’s. We want an agreement and we expect the European Council, in the event of an agreement being reached, to grant the Cyprus Presidency a mandate that is an adequate basis for flexible and open-ended negotiations with the European Parliament with a view to achieving a result in the coming weeks. If no suitable proposals are forthcoming, a poor, indeed an extremely poor offer from the European Council will be much worse for the European Parliament than the safety nets granted to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. We will not fall through the safety net! This is not a crisis! We would simply find ourselves working with different and quite possibly better figures.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The proposal to cut around EUR 75 billion from the Commission proposal is wholly unacceptable, not only due to the amount, but also because it represents an unbelievable attack on both cohesion policy and agricultural policy. The approach taken by the President of the Council, namely further cutting the money for certain Member States and least-favoured regions, while increasing the lump sum for Germany and the Netherlands and doing nothing about the United Kingdom rebate, is wholly unacceptable. By cutting funds for less-developed regions, budgets, and financing and pre-financing rates, the structural funds are being indiscriminately penalised, despite having already been adversely affected by the Stability and Growth Pact. They are robbing the poor to buy the approval of the rich in a wretched accounting logic, which has become the focal point of the next Union budget. Without money, the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform cannot happen. We cannot ask our farmers to endure more greening, more liberalisation and more international competition, and then reward them with drastic cuts in the CAP. Without money, the necessary increase in internal convergence between our Member States and our regions will be impossible, bearing in mind that it would be irresponsible to further increase the internal divergences in the Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I regret that the President of the European Council did not attend the debate. The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections.</p>

Such a lack of leadership would be to the detriment of the European people, especially in the context of the current economic difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The leaders of the EU are now planning to reduce the budget for the common agriculture policy. Evidently, they have no clear understanding of how important the CAP is for the European people, for the environment and for the economy. The CAP is not just for farmers. It is a measure that benefits rural populations, produces high-quality food for European consumers, has great capability for developing trade, creating jobs and encouraging economic growth, and, above all, ensures that healthy sources of food are available in a world where the population is increasing and resources are under pressure.</p>

      <p sl="lt">As an MEP elected by Lithuanian citizens, it is very difficult for me to welcome the draft set of European Council conclusions presented by the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy last week and the proposed allocation of funds it contains for the next financial perspective. The most severe and probably the most damaging element of this proposal is the significant reduction in funds for cohesion policy. Such a proposal is completely unacceptable because in future it would be particularly damaging for the European Union as a family of states. The substance of cohesion policy is to align the level of development of all EU regions, thus the Council proposal to reduce these funds, which would be particularly detrimental to the regions that are currently the least developed, completely negates the substance of cohesion policy and would lead to a so-called two-speed Europe. The second highly criticised proposal by the Council is to reduce spending on agriculture. It is particularly hard to welcome the Council’s proposed extension of the transition period during which direct payments have to be harmonised for all EU Member States. Finally, the money that the Council currently plans to grant for the decommissioning of three nuclear power plants and specifically Lithuania’s nuclear power plant. First of all, the estimated funds are totally inadequate for the decommissioning of this facility. Secondly, the suspension of support in 2017 is completely unacceptable. Support must be provided over the period of at least the whole of the new financial perspective. Otherwise an undue burden would be imposed on Lithuania, which it really would be incapable of financing from its national budget, and other vitally important areas administered by the state would suffer as a result.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Discussion of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) is not just a discussion about financial resources. It is a discussion about what we want Europe to be: whether we are going down the road of greater integration and solidarity between rich and poor or whether we view our relationships solely in terms of money. Give just what you have to. If I contribute to the budget, what is in it for me? In this context, I can understand the division of states into friends of cohesion and friends of better spending. We can see in the Czech Republic where the policy of cuts is leading and I do not want Europe to go the same way. The European budget amounts to just 1 % of all the Member States’ budgets and 94 % of it goes back into projects in the Member States. We have the opportunity at a European level to support activities leading to growth and to reducing unemployment or activities which exceed the capabilities of individual states, such as transport links.

The European budget must complement the national budgets and fund common activities aimed at alleviating the impacts of austerity at national level. The European budget must focus on the economic growth that we all now need. The Union must respond adequately to the expectations of the European citizens. We cannot aim for greater economic, social and territorial cohesion, deeper market integration and economic growth, and, at the same time, cut the budgetary lines meant to sustain these. I call on the members of the Council of the European Union to consider these facts and make the responsible decision on the MFF so that the EU is not deprived of the financial resources it needs to exercise its competences.</p>

It is important to increase funding for employment, education, training, mobility, youth and social inclusion. Social inclusion of young Europeans has to be mainstreamed and prioritised in all relevant policies financed from the EU budget. Youth-related instruments, such as the Youth Guarantee, have to be proposed by the European Commission. The necessary funding for Cohesion policy (structural funds and cohesion fund) should remain available for all regions and maintained at least at 2007-13 level. 25 % of the overall funding for cohesion policy should be allocated to ESF (European Social Fund) to promote employability and social investment. 20 % of ESF funding should be set aside for promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. European Globalisation Fund shall be continued and upgraded as in instrument to help all categories of workers to re-enter the labour market and acquire new skills.

      <p sl="pt">In the European Parliament there is broad consensus on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014-2020. In the Council there is wide division on this subject. Parliament believes that the next financial perspective should be guided by the Europe 2020 strategy to help relaunch the economy, create jobs and growth, and promote cohesion and solidarity. The EU budget is a budget for investment, given that only 6 % is destined for administrative expenses. It has recognised added value and an important leverage effect in terms of public investment and the creation of wealth and jobs. Accordingly, at a time of recession, it makes no sense to reduce it. It would be an even greater mistake to reduce the MFF amount at the cost of cohesion policy, which would clearly show a lack of solidarity with the poorest regions and Member States. Many seem to forget that cohesion policy consists of the European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund, and therefore contributes towards smart growth, research, capacity building and, at its heart, sound expenditure. For example, in Portugal around two-thirds of cohesion policy funds are used for smart growth. These difficult times demand courage, solidarity and a strategic vision on the part of the Council.</p>

The European Council is not a direct party to the negotiations, but the Council is guided by political agreement on key questions of politics! When we speak of the MMF, we are talking about the projection of our political priorities for a given period into financial terms. These negotiations are about more than just money. The MMF sets the budgetary discipline and ensures that expenditure is incurred systematically and in accordance with our political objectives. We know that the EU budget is a key instrument in overcoming the current crisis and an expression of solidarity within the EU. Correct determination of the financial priorities will have a positive impact on growth and employment. A marked increase will be needed in the financing of projects aimed at increasing competitiveness, supporting small and medium size enterprises, supporting research and innovation, investment aimed at job creation and support for measures to combat climate change. But let us not forget that the negotiations on the MMF should be completed as quickly as possible, definitely by the end of 2012. Only this will allow us to make a smooth transition from one financial period to the next. If we want to be able to start to implement these programmes from January 2014, political agreement must be reached at least eighteen months before the Framework enters into force.</p>

The European Parliament has made its position clear on many occasions. We want a long-term budget that will allow growth, investment, flexibility and transparency, in order to allow the EU to tackle future challenges and unforeseen needs. A reduced budget will only put EU policies in jeopardy and damage the EU in the long run. On the eve of the Council meeting I wish to remind the Council that the Parliament’s approval is needed for any agreement on the MFF, and we will be ready to use our veto if our position is not taken into consideration.

For its economic and political power to continue to grow, it needs to be underpinned by a budget which promotes solidarity among the different Member States and generations and creates synergies between different policy areas, while at the same time enhancing competitiveness. I deplore all political attempts to use the budget to weaken or bring an end to the European Union. In order to sustain a united Europe, the next seven-year budget must therefore contain the points listed below. Every budget heading must ensure that the goals and commitments set out within it are fully covered, without taking resources away from other budget headings. Any budget cuts must be spread evenly across the various headings. Cohesion must be geared towards ensuring that freedom of movement is not a necessity driven by despair, but something freely chosen. The budget must enable the cohesion countries to catch up effectively, without trying to delude them. It must not call into question the European social model. It must clearly highlight the priorities. In the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the key issues here are a uniform and flexible budget, the European Stability Mechanism, and political agreement on the own resources issue.</p>

Member States whose leaders are insisting on freezing or reducing the amount of MFF tend to ignore the fact that during the recent past national budgets have grown several times faster than the EU budget. Freezing the EU budget will demonstrate both hypocrisy and irresponsibility for 2020 priorities which cannot be realized without increasing the MFF, not reducing it. The EU is based first of all on the principle of mutual solidarity. Estonia still has lower pensions than Greeks. Even so, it is contributing to the rescue operation to help Greece out of the crisis.

Unfortunately, negotiations on the MFF have recently got stuck and there has been a certain split among Member States. The group dominated by ‘net contributors’ is demanding cuts in the MFF. If such cuts are implemented, the MFF will shift to a level of about EUR 973 billion, which would mean a fall of EUR 20 billion in comparison with the current MFF at 2011 prices. I am therefore a fan of the second group (‘the friends of cohesion’), which supports the Commission’s original proposal, because I consider the MFF to be the key instrument in overcoming the crisis. If the cuts are implemented, there would be a reduction in competitiveness, growth and employment in the EU.

I do not understand why the Council consistently discriminates against this expenditure, in spite of its unquestioned success in boosting investment and growth in the regions that most need it.</p>

Second-pillar CAP financing is relied upon by all inhabitants of rural areas, who require modernised infrastructure, specialist health care and investment in education, recreation, tourism and sport. This is essential if we are to halt the damaging trend of migration from villages to towns. In the light of the above considerations, Parliament should firmly oppose any cuts in these budget areas.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Parliament must not be underestimated in the current budget and financial negotiations. It is strange that Parliament is regarded more and more as some sort of necessary evil. It is only listened to reluctantly and under duress.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is not a sustainable operating model from the perspective of European democracy. The multiannual financial framework is not a show of strength between the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Europe needs a strong budget that can be used to respond to the social pressures, increased unemployment and reduced competitiveness caused by the crisis. This means that more money is needed, and it should be aimed at measures that increase growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even this week, there is a group of demonstrators standing in front of Parliament, demanding work and social justice. Why has the social dimension of the crisis been forgotten? The European Union is in the prime position for financing projects and programmes to increase growth and investment all over Europe. Without growth and investment, no new jobs will be created. The current line of savings will only increase social inequality and displacement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is the worst-off and socially most vulnerable sectors of society that are hit the hardest by unrealistic objectives. Thanks to the crisis, 25 million citizens have remained out of work in the EU, 5.5 million of them young people. It seems unbelievable that the equation of this social crisis could be solved merely by making the austerity programmes even more stringent. Discord and blame do not help to create a budget agreement, nor do they help to polish the tarnished image of the EU among citizens. A resolute, logical and credible economic policy is needed now. A balanced budget policy is needed, as well as sufficient active stimulation. Europe and Europeans need jobs, investment and growth now.</p>

      <p sl="lv">The European Union’s multiannual budget is an investment budget for growth. It is not a consumption budget. Investment in the attainment of the European Union’s common goals and the fulfilment of its obligations provides considerable added value to Europe’s nations as a whole. However, the budget must be sufficient to attain these goals. Particular emphasis should be placed on investment in cohesion policy, agriculture, research and education, which are vital cornerstones for the EU’s growth. At the moment it is clear that the European Council’s approach is precluding growth. If we cannot ensure or even plan to ensure that the ambitious goals of the Europe 2020 strategy will be achieved through the EU multiannual budget, both the European Council and the Presidency ought to be honest and say as much. Let us avoid the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy, where people by and large persisted in speaking about it, while already knowing that its goals would not be achieved. One of the EU’s values is solidarity. I hope that the promises that have been made to the Baltic States will materialise in concrete actions. Actions speak louder than words. To conclude: the only way in which we will be able to emerge from the crisis in time is to invest in a targeted way and with sufficient resources in our joint growth.</p>

Although we understand the financial restraints and the rationalisation efforts which the Member States are making, the cuts proposed in the European Council’s draft conclusions are unacceptable. As regards cohesion policy, the proposals made by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, for cuts amounting to EUR 29.5 billion in relation to the Commission’s proposal, represent the fourth round of cuts since that proposal was presented. The same 27 countries which in June unanimously decided on the need for investment, are now competing to see who will propose the biggest cuts in what is purely an investment budget, the European budget. We therefore continue to maintain that we need an ambitious European budget, capable of financing the priorities of the European Union, and that this cannot possibly be achieved with cuts.

The proposal involves a budget cut of EUR 81 billion (EUR 74.5 billion in the multiannual financial framework and EUR 6.2 billion in other budget lines). I am wholly against the proposal presented by the President of the Council as it advocates a reduction of approximately EUR 30 billion in cohesion policy funds and another EUR 25 billion in agriculture and rural development funds. These are two European policies which significantly benefit Portugal and the Portuguese people, and I cannot therefore agree to a drastic reduction in their financial envelope. As I have already done in the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development and in various other forums on this issue, I continue to firmly reject the 48 % reduction in the specific additional allocation for the outermost and sparsely populated regions.

It is struggling to tackle the crisis and the Member States are more divided than ever, certainly when it comes to the new multiannual budget. An ambitious agreement is nonetheless supremely important for the future of the Union, because the budget is the only solidarity mechanism that we have in the Union and that solidarity mechanism is under pressure. Net payers are no longer willing to foot the bill for countries that are struggling, which puts the future of the whole European construction at risk. The financial crisis is undermining the whole solidarity mechanism. It is ironic that it is those countries above all who think that we should cut spending ‘together’, who want to prevent Member States from acting out of real solidarity with each other. Cutting spending together is alright, building something up together is not. That is why it is essential that the Union has its own funds at its disposal. Otherwise solidarity within the EU will simply come under more and more pressure. That is the only way we will be able to draft a European budget with sufficient funds to invest in sustainable growth and jobs. Without this investment we are facing a lost decade and lost generations, who are in danger of turning their backs on the EU.</p>

We must not get confused over the debate: it is not a matter of deciding which programmes are to be cut, but what future we want for our Union. Too often, we hear that the European budget was an expenditure budget, when in reality it is an investment budget, a strategic instrument to support intelligent, inclusive and sustainable growth. I must emphasise one point: the Connecting Europe Facility and its transport dimension. We know that the transport sector is a lever for growth and competitiveness and a key source of employment. Yes, Parliament has asked for a large budget for it, but I would actually describe it as ambitious. Our House will be extremely vigilant, even if our hopes are in vain, in the negotiations over the next couple of days in the European Council, which must not forget that the European Parliament will have its say. It will thus be able to say yes, or say no if the proposal on the table is not satisfactory.</p>

Contrary to the impression given by this debate, and despite the impassioned statements made on both sides, the Council and Commission positions do not substantially differ. There is less than 0.2 % of EU gross national income between them. The clear message is therefore that, in a Europe of inequalities and divergence, the funds for economic and social cohesion are going to be cut! This message is in line with the established practice of this European Union: robbing the poor to give to the rich. On the one hand, they want to extend and deepen integration and the single market, by ensuring new and better conditions for the colonisation of markets by the net beneficiaries of the single market. On the other hand, these same net beneficiaries want to squeeze the budget, particularly the cohesion lines – which are the best way of minimising the divergence between our economies – while, however, safeguarding in relative terms those lines from which they hope to secure more resources. This is a path that cannot be accepted by all those – such as Portugal – who will suffer as a result, and severely so.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Ladies and gentlemen, the bilateral agreement on the administration of tariff-rate quotas applying to exports of wood from the Russian Federation to the European Union is an important guarantee that trade with Russia will start to flow in a more stable and much more predictable manner. In joining the World Trade Organisation Russia has agreed to reduce export duties on raw materials, including on two types of coniferous wood: pine and spruce. The agreement is very important, because it lays down a specific quota share within the framework of which export duties are significantly lower.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The main beneficiary will be the European Union’s wood-processing industry. Our businesses will now pay nearly half as much in Russian export duties as they have done up until now. We can expect that import volumes in the coming years will approach the levels seen prior to 2008, when Russia unexpectedly increased export duties and the European Union’s imports of coniferous wood and round timber fell by 80 %.</p>
      <p sl="lv">At the same time, it is very important to note that there is a protocol attached to this agreement which contains binding rules on a dispute-resolution procedure. We have also managed to win an important victory for Parliament, which is that amendments to the trade agreement in future are to be carried out within the ordinary legislative procedure, although the Council had originally recommended allocating implementing authority to the Commission, thus limiting Parliament’s authority.</p>
      <p sl="lv">I would like to thank the members of the Committee on International Trade as well as my fellow Members for their excellent assistance, and I call upon you to vote for this agreement.</p>

As well as that, the Commission should act more promptly in imposing fines on countries or in bringing them to court for not implementing the rules or the laws. Nevertheless, there is another side to the story: sometimes the authorities in those countries are too severe, especially with regard to individuals like farmers and fishermen when they make a minor mistake: terrible penalties are imposed on them, even though the blunders may have been the result of an accident rather than on purpose.

To this end, a number of Member States have permitted shale gas exploration and are preparing for extraction if discoveries allow. In this context it is important to monitor regulatory regimes on shale gas extraction within the EU, so that its effects, which are certainly positive in economic terms, do not create environmental problems due to potential leakages of harmful substances into aquifers and into the atmosphere.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, there are two aspects to the measure that we have adopted, one geopolitical and the other environmental. Geopolitically the introduction of shale gas extraction could have a positive effect for Europe, since it might reduce our dependence on Iranian and Russian resources, but there are strong environmental concerns. This apparently harmless gas may have a severe impact on the environment, on nature and on the coming generations. The resolution we have adopted therefore takes a cautious approach and introduces a moratorium. However, we will have to return to the question to assess the environmental effects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the dangers of fracking to the environment and to public health are so serious in my opinion that they cannot be regulated for. That is why I signed the amendment seeking a total ban, and when that amendment was defeated I voted against the report as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Incredibly, the water used for one single well for fracking would supply 10 000 Europeans with water for a whole year, and a recent German study states that the global warming footprint of shale gas extracted at a depth of 1 000 metres is 30 % larger than for natural gas, and it is twice as large for gas obtained 2 500 metres down.</p>
      <p sl="en">This environmentally dangerous practice must be banned. It is precisely the same big oil and big gas companies that have already made super profits, and that have already endangered our environment, who now tell us that shale gas is safe and that there is no problem. They simply cannot be trusted. Instead of relying on them, the public sector must become the spearhead of investment into research and development and infrastructure to develop green energy production. This can be financed through taking the massive accumulated profits of big oil into democratic public ownership.</p>

It is important for us to discuss shale gas and oil here from the perspectives of industry, energy and other viewpoints, and of course it is important that we discuss them bearing in mind the environmental considerations, because we in the European Union and the Member States are committed to sustainable development and sustainable growth, and for this reason it is very important that we consider how best to use European energy resources when we look for these new forms of energy and new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="fi">However, when we talk about better use, this must not merely be regarded as financial benefit and financial profit, but we must also look at environmental values. I must say that it is very important in this respect to emphasise precisely this aspect of the report; new technologies and investment are needed, and we can thus develop our mining industry in a sustainable way.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think we need to take into consideration the views of the Commissioner for the Environment, who just yesterday evening spoke in this Parliament He said that there are gaps in European legislation and he confirmed that the Commission will carry out an impact assessment in 2013 – part of which will be a public consultation. At least that will give citizens and the public a chance to have an input and to make their views known.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, cheaper energy is the chief motor of human economic progress. Every great advance in our living standards, from the Industrial Revolution onwards, has been accompanied by a fall in energy prices that allows production prices to fall and makes us more competitive. It allows us to get more out of less. The revolution which happened with oil was a huge improvement. It allowed one barrel to do the work of hundreds of men and all of us are benefiting from the consequent rise in our living standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shale oil is a providential gift to this part of the world. Instead of having to carpet our hills with wind farms and dam our estuaries with turbines, here is a discreet way of getting at more power and ending our reliance on some unpleasant and autocratic regimes.

But what is important is that we consider the impact not only on the environment but also the impact of the environmental movement on this. It is often said that if the modern combustion engine was invented today the environmental movement would have killed it and we have to understand that we have to get the right balance between technological progress and saving our environment and protecting our environment.</p>

I can understand the frustration of my Polish colleagues who are fed up of dependence on Russia and hear no sympathy in this Parliament from the other political groups.

With this report the European Parliament insists on a number of regulations for the energy industry extracting shale gas. The most important of them, defended by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, are the following: European Union funding for research and innovation in the field, compulsory environmental impact assessment, fracking fluids to be considered hazardous waste, and fracking in areas with drinking water to be banned. The adoption of the report should not be seen as a green light for shale gas extraction in the EU Member States or indicative of the European Parliament’s support in this direction. First and foremost, it lays down restrictions and standards that should be observed in the countries where such extraction is permitted. I, personally, am in favour of the complete ban on shale gas extraction through fracking and hope that Bulgaria will remain one of the countries where such extraction is prohibited.</p>

The report does not consider the precautionary principle and is way too optimistic in regard to fracking.

He also said that there are significant gaps in EU legislation in regard to fracking.</p>

Because one of the things my constituents say to me is: Hold on a minute – we are supposed to be in this EU; we are supposed to have free movement of people; we are supposed to be able to buy property elsewhere yet, when we buy a property in Spain, the regions in Spain use local laws to undermine our ability and to actually demand even more money from us. How is it that the EU, at the same time as encouraging free movement of people, cannot do anything about corruption at the local level in Spain?</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important that this issue is brought to the Petitions Committee so we can demonstrate right across the spectrum that MEPs in this House are concerned about issues like that. Hopefully we will find a resolution whereby the Spanish Government and the Spanish regions will finally tackle corruption at the local level.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted against this appointment. France is preparing to make crucial progress on equal rights by adopting a law on marriage for all, at last joining several other Member States who have done the same. I believe that Tonio Borg’s appointment would contradict that progress in France and in Europe. His proposed portfolio – European Commissioner for Health – is fundamentally incompatible with his past statements and actions on contraception, abortion, and homosexual and transsexual rights. The holder of this position is meant to work for all European citizens, irrespective of their sex and their sexual orientation. Against a backdrop of particularly vicious comments and acts by extremists in France, appointing Tonio Borg would mean that Europe can accommodate such deviations. It is clear to all French Socialists that fundamental rights are not a matter for subsidiarity: they are universal. Irrespective of competence, this is an ethical matter: the European citizens have the right to expect Europe and the European Commissioners to defend these values without fail.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Tonio Borg has, on numerous occasions, publicly voiced radical opinions on the issues of abortion and same-sex relationships. Particularly shocking was his statement that Maltese law should protect only those who ‘deserve’ protection, in the context of a discussion on granting same-sex couples the right to apply for social housing. This is in addition to his strong opposition to divorce, which was recently the subject of a referendum in Malta. Tonio Borg is the Commissioner-designate for health. This is an area of political activity that is particularly susceptible to the influence of a Commissioner’s personal convictions. Mr Borg’s beliefs concerning abortion and homosexuality are of special relevance in this regard. The matter of abortion is, of course, governed by national law. However, the Commission and individual Commissioners can contribute to the climate in which that legislation is enforced.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Poland’s abortion legislation is unusually restrictive. Worse still, in many cases in which abortion is permitted, access to it in practice is made difficult or even impossible. That is why the appointment of a staunch opponent of abortion to the position of Commissioner for Health should set off alarm bells.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The same is true with regard to same-sex couples. I am particularly concerned here with access for same-sex partners to information about their partner’s state of health. In many Member States, the practice in this regard is incompatible with the principle of respect for human dignity. In view of the above, I decided to vote against Tonio Borg’s appointment as Commissioner.</p>

There are serious reservations about his appointment, since he was unable to clear up a number of serious concerns about his beliefs on some moral issues linked to his portfolio. Our group voted against this appointment, but now hopes that he will be proactive in promoting policies based on the European Union’s fundamental values, and this is something that the European Commission and the European Parliament will have to monitor and ensure. Mr Borg must become an ardent supporter of robust European legislation on tobacco products. The controversy surrounding this issue, heightened by Mr Dalli’s resignation, has raised serious concerns about the influence of the tobacco lobby. Mr Borg must ensure that this draft legislation is published as soon as possible and that his priority is the protection of human health, not the profits of the tobacco industry. We would also emphasise his promise to launch the inter-service consultation as soon as he takes up his post. Tobacco is the leading cause of death in Europe: ensuring tougher European rules on labelling and other aspects clearly has to be a priority.</p>

As part of his portfolio, he must also campaign for the rights of same-sex couples and women’s right of self-determination. Will he do so, however?

The European Parliament has finally managed to approve, with an overwhelming majority, the mobilisation of EUR 670 million for the reconstruction of the towns and villages of Emilia-Romagna that were destroyed in a series of earthquakes that started on 20 May 2012, leaving 27 dead, over 350 injured and over 45 000 evacuated.

It was only the stance maintained by the European Parliament – which insisted on not making mobilisation of the fund conditional upon the outcome of negotiations on the EU’s 2013 budget – that led the Council to approve DAB 5, and it only did so after the negotiations on the 2013 budget had reached a deadlock.

Ultimately, this is about the implementation of programmes that have already been approved and must now be funded. They include programmes to create jobs and growth and to promote education and research; in other words, they are projects that invest in our young people, such as Erasmus. It undermines Europe’s credibility if students have to worry whether the funding that has been promised will actually materialise. We need a clear commitment here, for this is one of the EU’s most successful programme. It has enabled almost three million young people to study abroad over the last 25 years and we must ensure that it continues. A swift agreement on the amending budget is also essential because otherwise, it will not be possible to conduct meaningful negotiations on the 2013 budget. I fail to comprehend the position of some Member States, especially given that much more than 90 % of EU funding is channelled back to the Member States anyway, where it exerts substantial leverage.

      <p sl="pt">The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was created with the aim of assisting Member States affected by a crisis or struggling with damage caused by natural disasters. As such, I welcome its mobilisation, provided that funds are carefully monitored and controlled to ensure that the assistance reaches those affected. I voted in favour of this report, which provides for the mobilisation of EUR 670 192 359 from the EUSF in favour of the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, which was struck in May 2012 by two violent earthquakes which caused 27 deaths and 350 injuries and resulted in destruction leading to the evacuation of over 45 000 Italian citizens. Despite the difficulties in negotiating the budget and the widespread sense of financial restraint in the EU, I consider that there are some ‘expenses’, such as these, which cannot and should not be avoided. I would add that Europe’s citizens will have a better understanding and perception of the EU’s added value if a greater proportion of the budget is allocated to the EUSF and other funds supporting European citizens, instead of being channelled, for example, to Houses of European History or unnecessary trips to Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The earthquakes that struck Italy in May 2012 left a trail of death and destruction, which still today cannot fail to move us. The extreme devastation suffered by certain areas in northern Italy cannot therefore fail to invite our solidarity and motivate our action. The European Union must intervene in situations of this magnitude, and seek to reduce their impact on those affected. The mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) is therefore a logical consequence to this readiness – which we must all demonstrate – to remain united in adversity.

This particular case concerned assistance for the people of the Emilia-Romagna region, which was struck by a series of earthquakes in May 2012 that caused several deaths and serious damage to homes, factories, agricultural land and over 100 historically significant structures. Although this mobilisation has been quicker than on previous occasions, the fact is that there is still a significant and unjustified time lag between the disaster occurring and the EU assistance being released. In this case, the time lag was over six months. This is one reason, among others, why we have been calling for the Regulation on the EUSF to be amended.

We cannot ignore the problems of this Member State, which is having to contend with the effects of a powerful earthquake. It is clear that Italy’s application for assistance must be granted a favourable response and it is essential that the European Union Solidarity Fund be mobilised. Many now no longer have a roof over their heads, but we should also remember that the earthquake hit a particularly industrialised region that generates the largest share of Italy’s GDP. Northern Italy will be dealing with the consequences of this natural disaster for a long time to come. It affects the country’s overall economy, which means that the EU will also suffer.

I wish to draw attention to the fact that a consistent policy is needed with regard to the substitution effects of imports affecting the Union’s poultry industry. I also suggest that the EU should simultaneously notify both countries upon conclusion of its internal procedures.</p>

The deepening crisis in Europe requires policies of investment, support and reinforcement of national production in each country, investment in small and medium-sized enterprises, and job creation, and not continued trade liberalisation which has caused so many difficulties for businesses in the weakest economies, such as Portugal. As a result of the agreement on poultry concluded in 2007 under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, the EU has witnessed a dramatic surge in processed poultry imports, which has negatively affected the European poultry sector. The harmful consequences of the liberalisation and deregulation of international trade are now recognised, as always after the fact and without the appropriate conclusions being drawn. Yet once again the same approach is being advocated. This report approves the conclusion of an agreement which provides for the opening of tariff quotas for processed poultry meat (and an increase of out-of-quota rates). These represent potential additional difficulties for a sector that has already suffered significantly from the difficulties associated with the costs of adapting production facilities to more specific EU legislation.</p>

The EU has a strong interest in the tariff-rate quotas, which provide for significant advantages for exports of wood from Russia, with in-quota duties significantly reduced compared to current ones. The Agreement establishes the rules regarding the management of the export tariff-rate quotas and provisions on the cooperation of the competent authorities of the European Union and the Government of the Russian Federation necessary to ensure the proper operation of the system.

Following 18 years of negotiations, Russia – which is an important source of raw materials for the EU – was officially accepted as a WTO member in December 2011. Huge pressure was placed on Russia to comply with all the WTO rules, resulting in the removal of all ‘protectionist barriers to trade’ with the EU. In this context, Russia has had to reduce export duty rates on wood products, particularly some coniferous wood species. This involves removing all ‘prohibitive’ barriers to trade with the EU, given its ‘strong offensive interest in this agreement’. Once again, it is the big business interests in the EU which are exerting their influence to reduce the costs of importing this raw material.

For certain types of wood, namely some coniferous wood species (i.e. spruce and pine), Russia has agreed to open tariff-rate quotas for exports of those products and allocate a specific quota share to the European Union.

Greens in INTA regard export duties as a legitimate policy tool of countries to stimulate domestic processing of raw materials, to reduce the use of raw materials or to control their outflows. Export duties, moreover, are consistent with WTO rules. Therefore, Greens in INTA were strongly opposed to the EU policy to make the accession of Russia to the WTO dependent on their withdrawal of all export duties, which held up the Russia WTO accession for more than three years. Eventually, the need to present a success for the 8th WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva last December made it that the EU gave in on a couple of its demands, so that Russia could be celebrated as a new WTO entry. However, the EU succeeded in negotiating the above protocols on a certain amount of wood imports from Russia under tariff-rate quotas. These quotas are set so high that they are not even used. Hence, these quotas will increase wood imports from Russia into the EU. Given Greens general policy to reduce the use of raw materials, but welcoming that a compromise had been found to accelerate the WTO membership of Russia, which Greens support, we abstained on both files in Committee.</p>

Foreign exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the level of protection by reducing chicken meat/offal content in preparations to under 57 %, thus qualifying for a bordering tariff line. These prepared poultry meat imports negatively affected this sector, which led the Commission to react and obtain authorisation from the Council to negotiate the modification of concessions on poultry meat under Chapter 16 of the Combined Nomenclature (CN). This was essential in my opinion. Supporting the adequate rebalancing exercise, which ensures a solution that is mutually acceptable to the respective partners, is vital for the EU’s external trade relations policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union witnessed a dramatic surge in processed poultry imports, due to substitution effects which negatively affected this industry. Foreign exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the level of legal protection by reducing chicken meat/offal content in preparations to under 57 %, thus qualifying for a bordering tariff line. Similar substitution effects were likely to take place under other tariff lines, covering other types of processed poultry. For that reason, and as this surge in prepared poultry meat imports negatively affected the European poultry industry, the Commission was authorised by the Council to negotiate the modification of concessions on poultry meat under Chapter 16 of the Combined Nomenclature (CN). As I consider that these modifications are beneficial to the EU, I voted in favour of concluding these agreements.</p>

We criticise that since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, an enormously increasing number of co-legislative dossiers is transmitted for vote very often without an extremely narrow timeline for consideration and with an absolutely insufficient provision of data (e.g. DG Trade just sent the draft Council decision, with even registration numbers of dossiers not filled in.

      <p sl="pt">The surge in prepared poultry meat imports from 2007 was due to the fact that foreign exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the level of protection by reducing chicken meat/offal content in preparations to under 57 %, which negatively affected the European poultry industry. Given this negative effect on the European poultry industry, the Commission was authorised by the Council to negotiate a new agreement, in order to protect the poultry industry in the single market, with Brazil and Thailand, which are the main exporters to be affected by the modification of concessions. The agreement signed between the EU and those countries stipulates that the EU must offset the increase of the bound duty by opening tariff-rate quotas and allocating substantial shares of these to Brazil and Thailand.

Following negotiations pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), the EU recorded a dramatic import surge of processed poultry meat. Foreign exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the EU level of protection, substituting poultry preparations containing more than 57 % of poultry meat with preparations containing less than 57 %, under a similar tariff line.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to address the substitution effects of imports affecting the EU poultry industry caused by the dramatic import surge of processed poultry meat, the Commission was authorised by the Council to renegotiate the concessions on poultry meat. The Commission negotiated in parallel with Brazil and Thailand, each of them holding principal supplying and/or substantial interests in several of the tariff lines concerned. The negotiations resulted in Agreements comprising a mutually satisfactory compensatory adjustment offsetting the increase in bound duties. The date of entry into force of the regulation should be the same as the date of entry into force of the two agreements, thus after receiving notifications from both Thailand and Brazil.</p>

This is a measure that will be of great benefit to European enterprises, particularly in the furniture, construction and paper industries.</p>

In the last few decades Russia has supplied 60 % of all the wood imported to the EU.

The EU has a strong interest in the tariff-rate quotas, which provide for significant advantages for exports of wood from Russia, with in-quota duties significantly reduced compared to current ones. The Agreement establishes the rules regarding the management of the export tariff-rate quotas and provisions on the cooperation of the competent authorities of the European Union and the Government of the Russian Federation necessary to ensure the proper operation of the system.

The migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II should start once the tests have all been successfully concluded, probably in January 2013.

The Council decided to split the proposal into two almost identical documents, in one of which Great Britain and Ireland can participate (police cooperation), and in the other they cannot (refusal of entry, etc.). On 5 October the Parliament was consulted on the splitting, therefore it was decided to apply a simplified procedure in accordance with Rule 46(2). Since only one Member objected within a set time limit, both reports are deemed adopted without vote on particular amendments.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I consider that the European Parliament must help to ensure that the implementation deadlines for Schengen Information System (SIS) II are met, and this regulation is part of the process of migration to the new SIS. Reports on the migration to SIS II were adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs through a simplified procedure so as to give the Commission and the Member States the legal instruments and the funds needed to migrate to the new generation SIS. I hope that the Commission and the Member States will fulfil their commitments and responsibilities and abide by the SIS II implementation schedule.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I must start by congratulating Carlos Coelho on his excellent work in preparing the reports on the draft Council regulation on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The SIS is the most important instrument for the security of the Schengen Area, which allows a Europe without borders or, in other words, an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’. The SIS II is a system for controlling our borders, which will replace the current system. It introduces a series of new aspects (such as the use of biometric data) in order to respond to the increasing number of requests and resolve the issues that have led to complaints. It is a more secure system which will enable more efficient use of the available data.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported the two reports on the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II, because I consider these reports a step forward. SIS II is one of the most important tools for the Schengen Area. The European Parliament rejects the continued use of an intergovernmental structure. It has always supported the evolution of the Schengen Area and the establishment of SIS II, which will be a truly European System. SIS II will make it possible to add new data (e.g. biometric data) and new functions, which can increase security across the EU and try to stop eventual threats to the overall security of the Schengen Area. SIS II will be a useful tool to fight organised crime, to detect criminal networks and to find missing persons. That is one of the reasons why I also appreciate the work that has been done by colleagues in the LIBE Committee. Finally, I voted for the report, because it aims to foster the area of freedom, security and justice, but more importantly because SIS II is an essential instrument that will considerably improve data protection and the fundamental rights of individuals.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of these two texts on migration from the Schengen Information System (1+) to SIS II. Our first message is clear: this migration was decided on several years ago, it is very delayed and it is now time to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently in the all of the Member States. We therefore urge the Council to get this system up and running without any further delay. Moreover, the SIS is a vital component of the Schengen system and Europe’s internal structure for the fight against organised crime and for internal security. This second version will modernise this database and, above all, provide a central structure under the Community system. The migration and, more generally, the database are subject to one absolutely fundamental principle (which is reiterated in both texts): stringent rules on the protection of personal data.</p>

      <p sl="es">I voted against this report because migration from the SIS I+ information system to SIS II is taking place without any guarantees of complete security for the information it contains. The proposal contains some positive points concerning legal certainty when extending the legal framework of the SIS II system to the period allowed for the national systems to adjust to SIS II, thereby preventing unnecessary expenditure in the European budget. Nevertheless, I already had serious reservations about data security and protection in SIS I+ and the migration to the new SIS will involve the introduction of new data, new types of indication and new functions without any complete guarantee of secure data protection. Given this gap in the security of European data, I could only vote against this report.</p>

The second generation SIS (SIS II) makes it possible to add new data (biometric data, in particular), new types of indication and other functions which can increase security and lead to a more intelligent use of information. The migration to SIS II is scheduled to start in early January next year. The SIS II is an essential instrument with which to increase the security of the Schengen Area. For several years, the European Parliament has upheld the need for a clearly Community solution and rejected the continued use of an intergovernmental structure. This is one of the reasons why we support SIS II. Despite approving the European Commission proposal, this report, which merited my backing, considers it essential to strengthen the rules on data protection and to ensure an efficient supervision of the complex migration.

Proper application of EU legislation by the Member States is an essential condition for the functioning of the European Union and I therefore welcome the goal of simplifying its implementation, application and enforcement in the Member States. The EU Pilot system has played a vital role in reducing the number of possible infringements in the application of EU law. This system is designed to deal with enquiries and complaints from citizens and business raising a question of the correct application of EU law. EU Pilot is used when clarification is required from Member States of the factual or legal position: solutions are to be provided by Member States within a short timeframe to correct infringements of EU law. I welcome the proposal to indicate in the system the rights or protection measures conferred on the complainant. The Commission should also ensure more effectively that the Member States transpose timely and correctly EU environmental legislation where the highest number of infringements takes place during application.

In recent years the extraction of ‘unconventional’ hydrocarbons, notably shale gas but also shale oil, has led to unprecedented and radical changes in global energy markets. In particular, shale gas has risen from 1.4 % of the US gas market in 2000 to some 17 % in 2011.</p>

Gas is and will be an important source of energy throughout the EU for at least until 2030 or 2035. Although conventional gas production is in decline, unless the situation changes a significant amount of gas will have to be imported to Europe for several decades to come. We are also considering beginning to use local shale gas resources and internal market integration may help to reduce the problem of EU’s dependency on gas imports. It should be noted that global gas prices and trade patterns have been changing fundamentally of late, with evident consequences for the EU. The ‘shale gas revolution’ is spreading across the world at a relatively rapid pace. While it is too early to conclude whether significant volumes might be extracted economically in the EU, a number of Member States have permitted shale gas exploration and are preparing for extraction if possible.

As such, I am endeavouring to adapt a pragmatic approach: I am opposed to hydraulic fracturing, which is banned in France, in light of the serious effects it could have on the environment, especially groundwater. The Member States are responsible for implementing their own energy policy, so I could not support Ms Rivasi’s amendment. However, I am not opposed to the idea of prospection and research to improve our knowledge of our energy potential.

In addition, the rock masses can be left unstable, with the release of methane into the atmosphere.

Regrettably, ideological prejudices are considerably strong and their advocates refuse to see some indisputable facts. Firstly, significant shale gas deposits have been discovered in some European countries while exploration is about to commence in others. Secondly, shale gas has already demonstrated substantial positive influence on the European gas market, reducing the prices and restricting Russia’s influence. Thirdly, in comparison with other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, the use of shale gas generates fewest carbon emissions. That is why the fears are mostly related to exploration and extraction risks. Today we showed our firm conviction to guarantee the highest possible environmental protection from the use of hydraulic fracturing on EU territory. At the same time we reject any possibility of imposing a pan-European moratorium on the exploration and extraction of shale gas deposits, which would contradict both the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU energy policy. There is no more sensible approach than the one we have just adopted: the decision on exploration and extraction is to be left to the individual countries, and environmental standards are to be extremely high and maintained at a European level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The exploitation of shale gas deposits has triggered a lively debate. On the one hand, we can see the success the United States has had with shale gas exploitation. As a result of this technology, the country is no longer an importer but an exporter of fossil fuels. On the other hand, environmental organisations report that use of the hydraulic fracturing method poses risks to the environment. In those countries in which deposits have been discovered, shale gas is a source of great hope. Hopes are particularly high in countries whose economies are reliant on natural gas imports. They are also especially sensitive with regard to energy security. Shale gas exploitation is seen not only as an opportunity for economic development, but also a chance to increase their energy security. One of these countries is Poland. That is why the issue of shale gas exploitation is very close to my heart. I am not one of those blinded by a vision of a shale gas El Dorado. At the same time, however, I do not believe that we can abandon the idea of exploiting shale gas. We need to give the fracking technology a chance. Based on what we know at present, we cannot categorically rule it out as harmful to the environment. However, we must keep track of scientific findings in this regard.

We, therefore, have to continue to research innovation exploration techniques in order to improve our knowledge of our energy resources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">With increasing global energy needs, oil, which for decades has been the main source of energy, has started to show signs that its reserves are coming to an end. This situation has led to an exponential rise in prices and prompted countries to find alternative sources, such as wind, photovoltaic, wave, geothermal and other forms of energy. However, human ingenuity is persistent in its search for and exploitation of other types of fuel. Attention is currently turning to the exploitation of ‘shale gas and oil’. This fuel is widely exploited in the US, where reserves could guarantee the country’s energy supply for the next 45 years. In the EU, although its existence has been confirmed in several countries in central and eastern Europe, there are many reservations about the advantages of this type of fuel, particularly due to the fear of the side effects of its exploitation on health and the environment. However, I believe that the EU cannot miss the chance of new energy resources. All the positive factors, such as the impact on the economy, must therefore be analysed together with the negative factors, particularly in terms of health and the environment, and we must find ways to eliminate or substantially reduce those negative factors.</p>

These aspects not only give us cause for concern, but also exclude the fundamental environmental issues. The capture of shale gas currently involves a highly controversial technique, which poses serious environmental risks, particularly groundwater and surface water contamination, as well as risks inherent in the instability of the rock masses. In addition, it has not been proven that there is a positive return on the amount of energy consumed using this extraction method.

      <p sl="sk">The extraction of shale gas can have a significant impact on the natural gas market in terms of dynamics and prices, as well as on power generation. Unconventional gas in the form of tight gas, shale gas and coal bed methane already forms more than half of gas production in the US, with shale gas showing the largest increase. According to estimates, total reserves in the EU exceed 56 000 billion m3, while technically exploitable sources may reach approximately 14 000 billion m3. However, there are concerns with respect to the impact of extraction on the environment. These focus on the potential consumption of large volumes of water, chemical pollution of groundwater bodies and especially of drinking water, on the treatment of waste water and risks to surface waters, on the storage of waste drill cuttings, on site-specific impacts, on seismic effects, and the possible implications for greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore important to monitor worldwide regulatory regimes and practices. The Commission and competent national authorities should also look at the potential environmental impact and provide the public with information based on verified scientific data, while retaining maximum transparency. We must carefully weigh all the benefits and risks and we can only do this if we eliminate the intentional concealment of the reality now subject to public discussion.</p>

Shale gas is extracted using the hydraulic fracturing technique, which involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and other corrosive chemicals to create fractures in the rocks that contain this gas. This extraction method has harmful effects on the environment: groundwater contamination, emission of toxic gases, and even earthquakes. Authorising this type of extraction means, once again, allowing the commercial interests of the large energy companies to take priority over the European environment.

All precautions must therefore be taken to prevent the potential terrible consequences of hydraulic fracturing.

Even though the moratorium was not approved, I am pleased that the European Parliament showed its desire to provide a framework for fracturing and to respond to these challenges.

However, the discovery of shale gas reserves in Europe could change the situation. According to a US study, France’s reserves are estimated at 90 years at our current consumption gas level. Exploration of these gases could restore some degree of energy independence for the EU, reduce energy costs for businesses and homes, and lighten our trade balance.

      <p sl="pl">The report by Niki Tzavela, a member of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which was adopted by Parliament today, gives the green light for the development of unconventional gas extraction in the European Union. It underlines the clear economic and social benefits the new technology will bring for Europe, following its spectacular success in the United States, delivering cheap gas and economic growth and ending the country’s dependence on imports. I need only mention the fact that, as a result of the shale gas revolution, the US has gone from an importer to an exporter of gas in the space of a few years. Its price on the US market is USD 70 per 1 000 m3, while Europe pays Russia, at the very least, more than eight times as much for a similar quantity of gas. Meanwhile, the report drafted by Bogusław Sonik, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which was adopted by a majority of 70 votes, in effect gives the amber light to this sector and does not serve Polish interests. It sends a very bad signal to industry, which, understandably, dislikes a lack of legal clarity and certainty. In spite of everything, the situation does not look promising for unconventional gas. At a time of crisis, the EU should deregulate and cut down on unnecessary legislation, as well as simplifying and facilitating new investment and economic development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report tries to promote the exploration and extraction of unconventional shale gas and oil, taking into account the industrial and energy market aspects, in pursuit of the European Commission’s objective of making gas a substantial element in the transition of the energy system to the ‘decarbonised economy’. It argues for the establishment of the infrastructures needed by the sector, while expressing the concern that this activity should be sustainable in financial terms. These aspects not only give us cause for concern, but also exclude the fundamental environmental issues. The capture of shale gas is currently a highly controversial technique due to the environmental impact and complexity of the operation, involving deep drilling, explosions in the shale layer, and injection of water, chemicals and sand at high pressure in order to extract the gas and oil. This process poses huge environmental risks, particularly in terms of the contamination of groundwater or watercourses draining from schistose rock masses, due to the injected chemicals. The rock masses can also be left unstable, with the release of methane into the atmosphere. This is an issue on which, at the very least, there should be a moratorium. We voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this proposal on assessing the environmental impact of shale gas and shale oil extraction. The main advantages of shale gas for the European Union would be greater energy independence from imports, greater competition and lower prices, as well as the creation of new jobs. However, shale gas extraction has a particularly negative impact on the environment: large amounts of water are used to extract it, groundwater is polluted and there is a risk of underground explosions. The extraction of such an unconventional fossil fuel may strengthen the EU economy and increase employment but there needs to be a thorough examination of all the impacts (on the environment, public health and climate change) before developing this technology. I welcome the proposals set out that in spite of Member States’ exclusive rights to exploit their energy resources, a level playing field should be ensured throughout the EU and there must be compliance with EU safety and environmental legislation when extracting this fossil fuel.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The issue of shale gas divided Parliament today in plenary. Unfortunately, the amendment that I co-signed, calling on the Member States not to authorise hydraulic fracturing, was rejected by the European Parliament: the 262 votes in favour were not sufficient. However, hydraulic fracturing currently poses many unsolvable problems. Moreover, the Tzavela report, which presents shale gas and the US experiences in an extremely positive light and which I voted against, was in fact adopted. The only silver lining is that the Sonik report on the environmental impacts of shale gas and shale oil extraction activities obtained a large majority. It calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing in sensitive areas. It notes that although every Member State has the right to determine its own energy mix, all states should have stringent rules on all exploration techniques, especially hydraulic fracturing. Taking the precautionary principle as its basis, Parliament therefore calls for legislative progress and recognition of the environmental impact of shale gas exploration. I welcome the adoption of this report, although we must continue to be vigilant given today’s contradictory votes. The battle continues!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Gas will have a crucial role to play in reducing emissions. In this context, shale gas and other unconventional gas sources are becoming potential important new sources of supply in Europe, which could lead to radical changes in global energy markets. It is noted that shale gas has risen from 1.4 % of the US gas market in 2000 to some 17 % in 2011. According to some estimates, total shale gas reserves in place in the EU exceed 56 thousand billion cubic metres (BCM), of which some 14 thousand BCM might be technically recoverable. Its exploitation must therefore be studied, with all the necessary conditions being created to ensure environmentally neutral exploration, extraction and use in accordance with all the safety rules on gas extraction activities.</p>

There is clearly a halfway point between those who are pro shale gas and those who are anti it, and it is essential to take the heat out of the debate. It would be a major strategic error to renounce this energy source now without even continuing the research. Equally, however, allowing unbridled exploration when the technique is not yet fully developed would be environmental madness. Shale gas has undeniable potential and we need to look at it seriously. As things stand, however, shale gas exploration puts the environment at risk and it would be irresponsible to go down that path.</p>

I decided to vote in favour of these reports after taking into account the environmental issues and the crucial need to develop our countries and our industries to respond to the needs of the citizens. In light of our current scientific knowledge, there is absolutely no doubt that large-scale commercial extraction by hydraulic fracturing would be contrary to environmental protection. However, that must not call into question the scientific research into this resource, which could allow France and Europe to obtain a degree of energy independence. Sensible, public and safe extraction of shale gas and oil in the years to come (on condition that safer extraction methods are perfected) would not only be an asset for our industry, it would also help to reduce the cost of energy for many families. I understand the fears and doubts that have arisen since we first discovered and began using unconventional methods to extract this energy source, and those fears are justified.

      <p sl="et">Today, I voted in favour of both reports on shale gas for the following reasons.</p>
      <p sl="et">Firstly, there are considerable shale gas deposits within the EU of which about 14 000 billion cubic metres could be available technology-wise. For comparison, the annual consumption of indigenous and imported conventional gas in the EU is about 522 billion cubic metres. Thus the demand for energy carriers is high and the potential use of shale gas increases our energy independence.</p>
      <p sl="et">Secondly, Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly states that Member States have sovereign rights regarding choice of energy mix, and issuing licences and other approvals for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon resources is a Member State prerogative. In other words, it is for each Member State to decide for itself how it addresses these issues.</p>
      <p sl="et">Thirdly, regardless of the decisions taken by Member States, environmental safety must be ensured, and where shale gas is extracted maximum compliance with environmental standards must be ensured by means of rigorous control mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="de">I voted in favour of the two own-initiative reports on the opportunities and risks of shale gas development in the EU. By adopting the two reports, we are taking appropriate account of the arguments advanced by the advocates and opponents of this technology. Of course it is desirable to reduce the dependency on natural gas imports from third countries. At a time when energy prices are soaring, we cannot avoid a debate about the potential opportunities afforded by shale gas development. Equally, we cannot close our eyes to the possible risks of this technology. Only when adverse environmental impacts, such as groundwater contamination, can be ruled out conclusively should licences be issued for its development. That also applies to test bores. That is why we are calling for compulsory environmental impact assessments before any bores take place, as well as the establishment of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so that citizens do not ultimately have to foot the bill. There should be a general ban on hydrofracking in drinking water protection areas. The same applies to coal mining areas. Interruptions to and shifts in groundwater flows can occur, and have occurred in this context, making reliable impact assessment impossible. An EU-wide ban on shale gas development should be rejected, however. Once fracking technology has been incorporated into EU environmental legislation, it is a matter for each Member State to decide whether to pursue the development of shale gas or not.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The idea of creating jobs and reducing our dependence on traditional fuels is appealing, but at what cost? It is not worth jeopardising our children’s future. I can see three problems that, while they remain unresolved, will prevent me from supporting exploration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first relates to water consumption, which is very important because it involves millions of cubic metres. The second problem is the pollution risks from the chemicals used for groundwater near wells. The last problem is the earth tremors caused by hydraulic fracturing. These can happen when the vibrations it causes encounter natural faults. The disturbance can then release existing tensions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There does not really seem to be a serious alternative to hydraulic fracturing today. Tests have been carried out in the United States with pressurised air instead of water, and in Canada with liquefied propane gas (LPG). Fracturing using electric arcs, which has been the subject of patents, is only at the experimental stage. I am therefore not opposed to exploration, but I am very much opposed to the types of exploration currently proposed.</p>

In its regular activity the committee works closely with Member States, the Commission, the European Ombudsman and other bodies in order to ensure that EU law is fully respected in both letter and spirit. EU citizens and residents have legitimate expectations that the issues that they raise with the Committee on Petitions may find a solution without undue delay within the legal framework of the European Union, which they look upon to uphold their rights as citizens of the Union, and in particular to defend their natural environment, health, freedom of movement, dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome the intense efforts of the Committee on Petitions to encourage the active participation of European citizens in the European Union’s decision-making. The 20 %rise in the number of petitions submitted in 2011 compared to 2010 shows that citizens are interested in contributing directly to the way in which the EU institutions adopt important decisions. I am, however, concerned that approximately 30 % of all petitions submitted were declared inadmissible, which means that the citizens are not sufficiently well informed of the eligibility criteria; this can be remedied by awareness and information campaigns across the Union. On the other hand, in respect of the issues covered, it is important to note the rise in the number of petitions on the environment, which reflects the citizens’ concerns in this area, but also indicates serious problems in the management of projects that damage the environment.</p>

In 2011 there were numerous petitions on different topics, including greater transparency of the workings of the EU institutions and the Spanish Coastal Law, which was the subject of a large number of petitions.

The work of this committee is vitally important as a way of directly linking European citizenship to the work of this Parliament. My vote against the report is not due to the activities of the Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member. It is intolerable that the report publicly congratulates the Spanish Government on compliance with the Ley de Costas (Spanish Coastal Act). While it is true that the property bubble has burst and that the pressure on our coastline has been reduced, there are no grounds for optimism. This situation is all too similar to that described in the Auken report, adopted by the same committee and by the European Parliament as a whole. That is why I voted against the report, because the work of the Committee on Petitions must serve to reflect the latest situation in the issues raised, and offer solutions. These solutions, for example to clean up the Galician rivers, require fact-finding visits, which can subsequently serve to offer a solution.</p>

      <p sl="el">It remains a worrying fact that most petitions submitted by European citizens concern issues of justice and fundamental rights. The number of petitions on such matters increased in 2011, mainly because of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, and they concern an issue which the competent committee has repeatedly examined. In this report, for which I voted, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to enforce the Charter dynamically, not conservatively, in response to citizens’ expectations arising from the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty. At the same time, despite the fact that its position was not accepted at the first stage, the European Parliament insists that the elimination of a lower age limit for petitions must be adopted, and that public hearings must be instituted in the European Parliament, as symbolic and substantive acts which will strengthen democracy and accountability at Community level.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Full exercise of the right of petition is essential to achieving the European project. The main focus of the work of the Committee on Petitions during 2011 was on the environment and fundamental rights. This was the case in discussions on petitions in committee, new petitions received, reports and hearings, and fact-finding visits. Furthermore, the number of new petitions increased, whereas the number of petitions registered steadily declined. This can be explained by the new filtering process introduced as of June 2011, by which so-called non-petitions were answered by other services. Given that the environment is the area with the highest number of petitions and infringement cases, representing almost 20 % of the total number, the Committee on Petitions invited Commissioner Potočnik to its meeting. I voted in favour of this report, given the important work of the Committee on Petitions.

The law is currently under revision, at present before the Spanish Parliament. According to both petitioners (mainly property owners) and main environmental NGOs, their concerns have not been taken into consideration – besides a process with minimal effective public participation – so they are not happy with it. The law, which makes unveiled reference to the need to foster economic activity whenever possible (therefore leaving rather aside the primary objective of environmental protection), will be adopted as the PP has absolute majority, but we have the opportunity to send a timely signal from the EP if our amendments are adopted in the report. The PP is trying to use the established working group on the topic – originally intended to establish good cooperation with Spanish authorities – as a legitimatising tool towards citizenship. Consequently, it has been so far rather a hoax, for which even the PPE Petitions’ coordinator is quite critical.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the 2013 budgetary procedure: work of the Conciliation Committee; statement by the President of Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-299-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">President. − Ladies and gentlemen, last Tuesday at midnight, the 21-day deadline for budget conciliation pursuant to Article 314 of the Treaty expired. The delegations of the Council and Parliament were unable to reach agreement on a draft text. This means that the budgetary procedure for the 2013 budget, based on the Commission draft, has temporarily broken down. As provided for in the Treaty for such contingencies, the Commission must now present a new draft. It has already announced that it will submit a new proposal on Friday this week, i.e. on 23 November, in the hope that the Council and Parliament, as equal parts of the budgetary authority, will be able to reach a compromise which would enable a regular budget for 2013 to come into effect on 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make it clear that the European Parliament is of course mindful of its responsibility in the budgetary procedure and, like the European Commission, is seeking to reach an agreement. We are aware that if no agreement is reached, a system of provisional twelfths will be put in place until an agreement can be reached. This is a viable way forward for the next budget year, but it is certainly not an ideal solution. Nonetheless, Parliament cannot give its approval to an agreement that is achieved at any price.</p>
      <p sl="de">With our budget, we are at a crossroads. Over the past two years, we trusted the assurances given by the Member States and accepted these assurances on the Council’s positions on payments, which were in all cases far below the Commission draft for the budget year in question. We did so in recognition of the difficult budgetary situation in some of our Member States. It was clear to all the institutions that the Union could not manage, and cannot manage, this assumed level of payments.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why the Council and Parliament, at the end of the budget negotiations in each of the past two years, have formally declared that all the payments that could not be made from the adopted budget would be dealt with under an amending budget, and that this would happen quickly and in a straightforward manner. In a joint statement, both parts of the budgetary authority – Parliament and Council – announced that they wished to proceed in this manner. I would like to read part of the statement to you. I quote the English version of the text:</p>
      <p sl="de">Taking into account the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in Member States, the Council and the European Parliament agree on a reduction of the level of payment appropriations for 2012 as compared to the Commission’s draft budget. They ask the Commission to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient. The Council and the European Parliament will take position on any draft amending budget as quickly as possible in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a statement by Members of Parliament who have lost touch with reality. This is a statement by the Member States of the European Union. This is our position now. The Commission has accumulated various unpaid accounts for the 2012 budget year. They relate to cohesion, the Social Fund, research, and Erasmus. They are accounts that need to be paid, amounting to EUR 9 billion. Let me say again that the funding requirement to cover these additional payments for 2012 – and, I might add, these only go up to 31 October – is not based on estimates or assumptions but on legally binding commitments which the Commission must fulfil. Before we can hold serious negotiations about the budget for 2013, the 2012 budget year must be signed off as correct.</p>
      <p sl="de">As it is not yet certain how many unpaid accounts will still be on the table on 31 December 2012, it is impossible to make a serious decision about the budgetary requirement for 2013. The Member States failed to produce credible assurances by the end of the conciliation period that they are willing to abide by the statement they made in November 2011 on the 2012 budget and cover the EUR 9 billion shortfall.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unlike traditional budget negotiations, however, there is no scope for concessions here. If I have accounts to pay, amounting in this instance to EUR 9 billion, I cannot make a maximum offer of EUR 2, 3 or 4 billion instead. However, that is the approach that was taken by the Member States until Tuesday evening. It was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament on that basis, for what the Member States were demanding was nothing less than a budget deficit.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this House is not prepared to adopt this approach at the European level, even if some Member States customarily apply it to their national budgets. It is not a viable way forward. If we do not solve the problems for 2012 and carry too many unpaid accounts forward to 2013 – and, I might add, these would then also attract interest for late payment – we will face intractable problems in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the sound financial management that we are obliged to uphold under the budget regulations. It is quite clear that the 2013 budget must be sufficient to meet all the payment obligations for next year. Any remaining liabilities from 2012, for example relating to October and November of the current year, must be met from additional budget resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament will continue to fight for its priorities, namely growth, competitiveness and employment. Here, the Commission’s draft, including commitment appropriations in category 1a, for example, undoubtedly need to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, we are prepared to work constructively and earnestly with the Council to achieve a quick solution to unresolved issues. We want a 2013 budget. We are willing and open to negotiations and we are confident that after the presentation of the Commission’s new draft budget, as soon as the procedure has restarted, the Council will also recognise that we have to pay the bills.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to end on a positive note. At Parliament’s insistence – and I myself worked intensively on this issue and would like to thank everyone involved, particularly Mr Lamassoure, but also Mr La Via and Ms Balzani; we all worked hard here – we were at least able to convince the Member States that the fifth amending budget for 2012 should be adopted swiftly, with assistance amounting to EUR 670 million being mobilised from the Solidarity Fund for the victims of the earthquake in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="de">With the vote on the amending budget at noon today, we signalled our active solidarity with one of our Member States and its citizens. Minister Mavroyiannis and I signed this amending budget a few moments ago, so that these funds can now be made available to the people who are most affected in the communities worst affected in Emilia-Romagna. This is genuine solidarity. Let us hope that the other budget issues can be brought to a positive conclusion so that during the December part-session, we can vote on an adequate sixth amending budget for 2012 as well as a solid budget for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final comment, ladies and gentlemen: this budgetary procedure was new territory for me, at least in my capacity as President of the House. It has been a steep learning curve. The main lesson I have learned is this: there is a stark contrast between the term ‘the Council’ and the reality of its members. ‘The Council’ is not Mr Mavroyiannis, nor is it all the Member States. However, in the Council, there are some Member States that are not willing to honour their pledges and Member States that are willing to lead us into budget deficit. In other words, they are demanding that we adopt the same reckless approach that they have applied for far too long and far too often to their national budgets. I am pleased to say that our budget experts in this House – and, I believe, the vast majority of Members as well – are not willing to go along with that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mavroyiannis, Commissioner, as Mr Schulz has pointed out, Tuesday, 13 November marked the end of the 21-day conciliation period, within which Parliament and the Council were not able to agree on a joint position on the 2013 budget. From Parliament’s point of view, it has been clear from the outset – as we have always underlined in our formal and informal discussions – that it would not be possible to deal with the matter of the 2013 budget without first closing the 2012 accounts. This required careful examination of Draft amending budget No 5 – on which we voted this morning and on which, as Mr Schulz has stated, there was some hesitation – and above all of draft amending budget No 6 for 2012 and of the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is in fact impossible to consider the appropriations for 2013 since the Commission proposed the budget without taking account of some rollovers of payments from the previous year. The risk of remaining without a budget and applying twelfths arrangements are quite evident and Parliament will make every effort to avoid this situation, but clearly we must defend our priorities. As for payments, we are calling for agreement on a suitable level that would allow the normal performance of all EU policies. With regard to commitments, we strongly believe in the need to invest in growth, development and employment. These are the priorities of the Council, and Parliament also chose them as priorities in its reading of the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are certainly aware of the difficulties of the Member States and take them into account during negotiations, but this cannot be taken to mean that the European Parliament is willing to sacrifice growth in the EU on the altar of austerity, without exception, as is being demanded by some national governments. I am however confident, in view of the atmosphere of mutual trust that has been established between the institutions, that agreement will be reached on the budget. But I would underline the fact that Parliament has the intention of exerting its prerogatives in the ordinary legislative procedure, as recognised in the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure correct implementation of EU policy in favour of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, in this debate we should be talking about the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the 2013 budget but, unfortunately, that is not the case. There has been no agreement because we have not even begun to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are still waiting for the Council to pay the outstanding invoices for 2012. President Schulz talked about this, as did the rapporteur for the 2013 budget, Mr La Via. In Parliament we have a very clear and logical position: we cannot start to talk of the next budget until this year’s problems are resolved. Indeed, this year’s problems are invoices, amounting to EUR 9 billion, which have yet to be paid and which directly affect many citizens in all countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Mavroyiannis, 500 workers in my country cannot receive assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but the same applies to 512 workers in Italy, 1 052 in Austria, 1 000 in Finland, 1 900 in Romania and 303 in Denmark. However, they are not the only people affected. European students do not know if they are going to receive Erasmus grants. Researchers in businesses and universities do not know if they are going to be paid for the work they have done. Why? Because the members of the Council cannot agree to pay, and that is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why we have been unable to make any progress on the negotiations and that is why we are now waiting for the European Commission to present a new proposal. The Commission is aware of Parliament’s position and we hope that its proposal will be consistent with it.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that there is sufficient room in the budget to give more resources to a number of European programmes. We believe that we need to strengthen the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation under the Seventh Framework Programme, and training and mobility programmes for our young people.</p>
      <p sl="es">In reality, there is not a big difference between Parliament and the Council when it comes to our priorities and I think that we can reach a rapid and satisfactory agreement, but the bigger problem with the agreement is, once again, the level of payments. If we do not want our programmes to be at a standstill again, with students worried about grants, or regions and local councils waiting for the money they were promised, the Commission cannot reduce its proposal. In fact, it should increase it, because we now know that neither the November nor the December invoices are going to be paid in 2012 and that we will need more money for 2013.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Schulz is no longer present, but I think that he expressed what it is about very well indeed in his introduction. The problem with the Council very often is that they make concessions to us in the negotiations and then, when the ink on those concessions is dry, they forget and say that Parliament’s demands are outrageous ‘because the circumstances have changed so much since we signed, that everyone must understand that it is no longer possible’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my opinion, it is completely clear: if you sign a contact, if you enter into an obligation, you should not be surprised when the bills come in and have to be paid. That is the way it is everywhere, including in Parliament. There is no point in saying that the budget cannot increase by more than inflation, and so on. It is simply a matter of fact that once you have entered into obligations, the time arrives when you have to pay.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question here is: are the Commission’s estimates right or not? There is always a great deal of misunderstanding about those estimates. This is because, if we were to believe the Member State’s own estimates that they submit to the Commission, then the budget would not have to increase by 6 or 7 % but double that. What we need first is a specific body at the level of the Member States to investigate carefully whether the estimates that the Member States submit to the Commission are correct or not. – I do have two minutes, by the way Mr President.– We need therefore to investigate whether these estimates are correct and if they are, then all that bickering about the budget for payments should not be so problematic every year. If you want the payments to be lower, there is only one solution and that is to reduce the obligations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the failure to agree in conciliation was, in my view, regrettable, not least because the press response sent a very negative message to the public. It gave the impression that it was the Parliament refusing to cooperate unless they received more money. In fact, the President of Parliament, before he left the Chamber, set out the case very clearly.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a technical dispute. It is a retrospective issue regarding EUR 9 billion, which is the sum which is reflected in draft amending budget 6. Long term, as Mr Mulder has just pointed out, the lessons to be learned are that we need far greater security and control of estimates and costs from the Member States. But for the immediate what we want to see is a freeze in the size of the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we fully accept that we cannot reasonably be expected to carry forward such a large liability, a liability which would be in excess of EUR 20 billion, from 2012 to 2013. It is clear that this is an issue for Council to resolve. I therefore think that we in this Parliament should seek a positive engagement with Council with a view to an early conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is no secret to anybody that the conciliation for 2013 failed before it even started. This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now?</p>
      <p sl="en">This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we very much regret that the Conciliation Committee which was convened after the European Parliament’s last plenary session in October 2012 was not able to reach agreement on a joint text on the 2013 budget within the 21-day period foreseen by the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cyprus Presidency did its utmost to achieve a positive outcome within the given timeframe. We worked hard to try to reconcile positions right up to the last few hours. But in the end we had to accept that the views of our two institutions remained far apart, and that it was therefore unfortunately not possible to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council believes that it showed considerable openness throughout the negotiations, and in particular during the last few days of the conciliation period. It was able to make some progress, and specifically was able to approve one of the key elements of the negotiation package – the draft amending budget No 5 for 2012 related to the mobilisation of EUR 670 million from the EU Solidarity Fund in support of Italy – without any modifications to the Commission’s proposal. Despite this, we were not able to find the necessary flexibility in each of our institutions needed to make further progress on the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">The mandate given to the Conciliation Committee was to find an agreement on the 2013 budget. However, it proved impossible to find a way forward on this issue without having addressed first the issue of the draft amending budget No 6 for 2012, which seeks EUR 9 billion in additional payment appropriations for this year. Ms Gardiazábal Rubial is right that Erasmus and globalisation are part of draft amending budget No 6 and we understand and appreciate the sense of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council was and is ready to discuss all elements of the budgetary package and is committed to honouring our payment obligations, but we continue to take the view that they cannot be dealt with in isolation from each other if we are to find a balanced outcome which will meet the concerns of all parties. This was in fact the hiatus between our respective positions. For us, there is an inescapable link between draft amending budget No 6 for 2012 and the 2013 budget, since both of them aim at ensuring the continuity of the same European Union programmes and actions, and both of them have to be financed from the same contributions from the Member States. Of course, having said that, it has to be very clear that we fully honour and respect the rights and prerogatives of Parliament and the essence and the nature of the budgetary procedure (i.e., colegislation, codecision); there is even an edge in your favour under some specific circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now have only a few weeks left until the end of this year. We now of course await, as was said, a new draft budget from the Commission which will need to take due account of the progress we have made to date in reconciling the different positions of our two institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, I would have preferred to have been in a different situation to that which we find ourselves in today. But I remain hopeful that we can still reach a positive outcome in the short time that is left to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cyprus Presidency will do its utmost to make rapid progress on the basis of the new draft budget. We count on Parliament’s willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue so that we can have an EU budget in place from the beginning of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that our collective credibility would be at stake if we failed to deliver this time round. It would simply not be understood if we were unable to reach agreement given what is at stake. But I am convinced that we can overcome the difficulties and reach a compromise. The Cyprus Presidency – and I personally – am committed to delivering a successful outcome.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to inform Parliament that unfortunately Mr Lewandowski has been called to Brussels for urgent preparations of the MFF. You will understand why it is quite a busy time for him so that is why I would like on his behalf and that of the Commission to echo what the President said in his introductory remark and welcome the approval of amending budget No 5 which will allow the payment of much awaited support to the people and authorities of Emilia-Romagna. I think that is just one example of what an EU money can actually do and why it matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the Commission regrets it was not possible to reach agreement on the 2013 budget within the conciliation period foreseen in the Treaty, we are convinced that we can still find a solution by the end of this year and in the next days the Commission will present a new draft budget, as foreseen in Article 314 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although there are differences in the positions of Parliament and the Council, the Conciliation Committee already made some progress in identifying possible elements of compromise on the 2013 budget. The Commission is taking these into account in preparing its new draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this way, the Commission hopes to maximise the chances for Council and Parliament to reach agreement on the 2013 budget before the end of the year and thus avoid recourse to provisional twelfths.</p>
      <p sl="en">The level of payments is a key outstanding issue. During the conciliation, one real sticking point related to the shortage of payment appropriations in the budget and the additional payment appropriations requested by the Commission for the year 2012. We are all aware of the economic difficulties facing Europe and of the austerity measures prevailing across Member States. However, it is the Union’s duty to meet its legal obligations resulting from commitments made in the current and previous budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Draft amending budget No 6 is still on the table and there is general recognition that bills have to be paid, and I say to Mrs Andreasen: real bills, real commitments, not estimates; it is also about the credibility of what we are doing here.</p>
      <p sl="en">A reasonable solution on meeting the payment needs in 2012 must be found now if the EU is to keep its credibility vis-à-vis national and regional authorities who have advanced the funds in the areas of cohesion and rural development, and also towards SMEs, researchers and, as has been mentioned already, students who are awaiting payments under programmes such as Erasmus and the Research Framework programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that an adequate and realistic level of payments is necessary to keep supporting investments on growth and job-enhancing measures, which are priorities shared by all institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just return to the 2013 budget and what comes next. The Commission will do its utmost to present a new draft budget that can be a sound basis for an agreement by Parliament and Council, and will continue to act as an honest broker to facilitate a swift adoption of the 2013 budget. We have already faced a similar situation back in 2010, with the first budget under the new Lisbon Treaty rules. At that time, after the failure of the Conciliation Committee, all institutions worked together in a very constructive and intense manner, which allowed for the adoption of the 2011 budget in due time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just finish, Mr President, by mentioning some of the consequences of not achieving this, because we believe that the consequences should not be underestimated. Just a few examples: implementation of key EU programmes and actions will be delayed with immediate effects on beneficiaries. That would include, among others, delayed reimbursements for expenditure on direct aid for agriculture because between 75 % and 80 % of the appropriations for direct aids are required for reimbursements in January and February 2013 next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be impossible to mobilise any of the special instruments like the EU Solidarity Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, or the Emergency Aid Reserve. And just a final example: some of the EU regulatory agencies which are in start-up phase and are to take on new tasks would face considerable difficulties in fulfilling their role – this would be the case for example with the large-scale IT systems agency in the area of home affairs, which will become operational in the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that both Parliament and the Cyprus Presidency are aware of these risks and that both are willing to cooperate intensively in the next two weeks to pave the way for a sound agreement before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I express my sincere hope for a solution, and trust that, based on common efforts, we will be able to meet in this House in December to endorse an agreed budget for 2013 which reflects shared priorities, can contribute to creating the conditions for economic growth, and shows the Union’s ability to act, which is the best signal we can send to EU citizens in these difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when it comes to the budget, Parliament has demonstrated realism and a sense of responsibility. For two consecutive years, a qualified majority of this Parliament agreed to the level of payments adopted by the Council of Ministers without adding a single euro. In its votes, Parliament ensured that precedence was given to its political priorities. They are same as the priorities of the European Council: the Europe 2020 agenda and, more recently, the content of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That same sense of responsibility guides us today when we say – as President Schulz did – that the 2013 budget cannot be discussed while we have yet to guarantee the financing of the 2012 payments in arrears. None of the 27 Ministers disputes the amount of these arrears, which total EUR 9 billion. However, some of them do not want to pay, in 2012, all of the outstanding payments for the programmes that were carried out in full in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That attitude is contrary to the financial regulation. It is contrary to the 2012 budget that we adopted. It includes the commitment, as President Schulz just said, to adopt, if necessary, an amending budget in the course of the year. Above all, that attitude is contrary to the Treaty itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget has to be balanced, which means that it has to be adopted in a balanced manner, but also that it has to be implemented in a balanced manner. We cannot get to the end of the year with a debt of EUR 9 billion. I would add that on the eve of the European Council, the refusal to pay yesterday’s invoices would means that commitments to future budgets would have no credibility whatsoever. In the meantime, this rejection of the 2013 budget reminds those who might have forgotten, in certain capitals, that when it comes to the budget, whether we are negotiating for one year or for seven years, nothing is possible with the European Parliament’s agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We trust the Commission – and I welcome its new Budget Commissioner – to prepare a new text that takes into account the state of play of our discussions and to act as facilitator, and we trust the Cypriot Presidency, which has been particularly active, to take the necessary initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I attended the conciliation meetings as rapporteur for the Parliament’s budget and the other sections budget, but we did not get even close to discussing those matters because of the discussions on draft amending budget No 5 and draft amending budget No 6.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am delighted that draft amending budget No 5 has finally been agreed. For us in Parliament this was a moral issue and not a financial or a budget issue, so we are pleased with that. I am disappointed, however, that no agreement was possible on draft amending budget No 6. I am concerned that legal commitments will not be met and I am even more concerned about the future of some programmes and some projects. I would hope that the Council could come to some agreement amongst themselves on this matter because this is really a fight within the Council and they need to sort that out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Returning briefly to the issue of Parliament’s and the other sections budgets, I just want to remind colleagues in this House how well we did. We have kept our increase next year down to 1.9 %, we have frozen Members’ allowances and cut various other budget lines. Of course, the 1.9 % figure includes the extra costs of Croatia and a 1.7 % salary increase so the real operating increase for this Parliament next year is only around 0.6 %, a cut in real terms. I think the Parliament can be proud of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the other sections’ budgets, there are really only two outstanding issues now. One is the overall level of increases which are to be given to the other institutions. The Council still wants a blanket freeze for all institutions in the budget next year. We are saying that is wrong. All the institutions are different and have different needs. Therefore we need to look at giving some of them an increase, but of course we are encouraging them to keep their increase down below 1.9 % as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other outstanding matter is the 1.7 % salary increase, which is currently with the Court of Justice. This Parliament believes that it is prudent and wise to put that 1.7 % salary increase into reserve. Indeed, the matter could be worse because if the Court does uphold that salary increase, we could be looking at finding funds going back to July 2007. So I would urge the Council, even at this stage, to make the concession and to say we should be putting that 1.7 % salary increase into reserve. This Parliament thinks it is wise and prudent to do so.</p>

There are many signs, however, that the Union is in danger of disappearing altogether. Various Member States are no longer willing to listen to requests from the Commission, evidence that the European Union is no longer able to generate interest or demonstrate its usefulness. One thing must be made clear: commitments made must be fulfilled and therefore any programmes that have been defined and established, such as Erasmus, must be provided with the resources necessary to continue. In the future we must act in a more pragmatic and less ideological fashion, setting ourselves objectives that are real priorities.

The Member States must first adopt an amending budget for 2012 for an additional EUR 9 billion. It is actually in the Member States’ interest to do so, as this money will be returned to them in the form of funding for investments that have already been made in the regions under cohesion policy.

This year’s annual budgetary procedure takes place under very difficult circumstances. For that reason, particular efforts are required from all sides if we are to reach agreement and establish a realistic and balanced budget for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cyprus Presidency of the Council, and I personally, will do our utmost to achieve a positive outcome by the end of this year. I would add that we look to the Commission to play its traditional role as honest broker, and I particularly count on Commissioner Lewandowski in relation to both the new draft budget, which he is currently preparing, and the facilitation of our subsequent discussions. I thank you once more for your attention and your understanding.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-established and fine tradition that we adopt a joint resolution in advance of climate conferences and prepare the delegation. Yesterday, we held a final meeting which was attended by the Commissioner and also the President of this House. My colleagues with experience in these matters tell me this was a first! With his contribution, the President sent out a strong signal that the full backing of the House is ensured and that we are taking on an important role in relation to COP 18, in that we will be holding discussions with as many international representatives as possible there and will also exercising our powers of persuasion. That really is essential. We hope that after tomorrow, we will be able to take with us a strong resolution that offers clear solutions. We have a duty to provide answers, for climate change can only be combated and halted through international cooperation. The conference in Doha will take place from 26 November to 7 December, and I am keen to see which positions China will adopt and which positions the US will adopt now that the President has been returned to office for a second term. How will they position themselves, and how will we then respond to the issues raised, and so on?</p>
      <p sl="de">We have just held an interesting debate about Europe’s financial future. This debate is relevant to us in Doha as well, for as is well-known, friendship stops where money begins. Where climate change is concerned, however, friendship begins in earnest. We must find answers to the question of how the fast-start period will continue to be financed after 2012. A great deal of money will be required here. However, it is important to emphasise, as always, that the deceptive aspect of climate change is that its effects are not felt immediately. Even if we were to adopt a decision tomorrow that CO2 emissions will be reduced by 50 % immediately, the effects would not be felt until very much later. Climate change and the financial crisis therefore have one feature in common: they will both cost a great deal of money.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we continue to prevaricate, also in the international arena, and do not manage to find a workable way forward in Doha, this will prove very costly for the international community and is likely to have extremely adverse effects for a great many people. It may even cost lives. Failure, therefore, is not an option. However, we should not demand too much, that much is clear. At previous conferences, we learned that we have to take small steps. However, the largest step that the industrialised nations must take is to deal with the future financing and safeguards for adaptation measures and climate action. Clearly, we remain committed to the 2° target. However, with a ‘business as usual’ approach, 3.5° or 4° is the more likely outcome, and no expert in the world can tell us the exact number of degrees at which we cause irreparable damage to the planet.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am most grateful to the Commissioner. Last week, we held a lengthy debate on how we wish to proceed internally with our emissions trading scheme. However, there is movement at the international level as well, and this applies to various sectors. I welcome the fact that we appear to be on track, here in the EP, towards a solution for aviation, which I hope will be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally before the conference. However, aviation is an international business, and if there is the possibility of achieving a global agreement here, we should stop the clock, as the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, but of course only for a short time. In that case, it is essential to ensure that the international negotiations produce a genuinely workable arrangement, with a workable decision being taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), resulting in an international agreement. Otherwise, the clocks will start ticking again in autumn next year and the legislation will proceed. I would also like to respond to the fellow Members who described this as ‘giving way’. Let me say this: ‘giving way’ looks very different. I believe this was a wise decision which this House should support. I believe it sends out a signal for the debates in Doha and shows, once again, that we are willing to compromise here.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further important point relates to climate diplomacy, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety included in the resolution. This means that we are following this issue at all levels, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), and it is always a topic of discussion at all the international meetings. The parliamentary delegation is very well prepared. I very much hope that everyone, including the Commission, will ensure that the parliamentary delegation is fully involved in all the daily briefings so that we have a lively exchange. Our role in Doha will be to convince as many people as possible in positions of responsibility outside the European Union that our ideas are the right ones, and advocate for a global agreement, so that a second commitment period can begin. That is crucial in order to combat climate change and achieve successes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with you the Climate Change Conference in Doha, which is now less than a week away. I particularly appreciate the excellent work undertaken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and would like to thank Matthias Groote and his co-rapporteurs for their excellent work and for the resolution on which you will be voting tomorrow. This provides us with valuable input into the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Doha will be a success if it maintains and builds upon the delicate balance achieved in Durban. It needs specifically to bring to a successful close the negotiated tracks under the Kyoto Protocol and Convention and to make significant progress on the two workstreams of the Durban Platform track. This means increasing the level of mitigation ambition prior to 2020, and devising a new global agreement by 2015 to come into effect by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear from the outset. Doha will not be the end point but rather the next step in a gradual process which has been underway since Copenhagen and which aims at securing a global, legally binding agreement which will apply as from 2020. The objective of these negotiations continues to be to ensure that global temperature increases remain well below 2°C. We must ensure that this commitment is respected and put into effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Doha package itself, the first element would be the adoption of the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. This will enable a second commitment period to start on 1 January 2013 and allow for a smooth transition towards the implementation of a wider legally binding framework as from 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is encouraging that Australia has announced that it intends to join this second commitment period. I would encourage other developed countries, such as New Zealand, which have not yet done so, to do the same.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second element of the Doha package will be the closure of the Convention track. At the Cancun and Durban conferences new institutions relating to financing, technology and adaptation were created. These must now become fully operational. We will also need to decide where to handle those issues which will not be resolved in Doha, such as the review, shared vision and the further evaluation of the new market-based mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Doha will provide the EU with the opportunity to demonstrate that it is on track to meet its fast-start finance pledge over the period 2010-2012 and enable us to work constructively on ways to increase financing between 2013 and 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third and final element is the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, where we need to make significant progress in Doha on two areas of work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to increase the level of mitigation ambition in the period before 2020. There are various ways in which this might be done. They include international cooperative partnership on energy efficiency, renewable energy, short-lived climate pollutants and hydrofluorocarbons. We hope that the forthcoming report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will provide increased momentum in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, further progress is needed towards reaching a global agreement by 2015. In Doha we must agree milestones for 2013 and the subsequent two years. The EU is open to a second commitment period in Durban. We are also pushing strongly for a high level of ambition and for a global agreement by 2015. This is why our role will be critical and why I am convinced that we can help ensure a successful outcome to the conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that we can count on the support and commitment of this Parliament. The Presidency looks forward to seeing some of you in Doha and we will be available to provide regular briefings on the spot as the negotiations progress.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-333-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, let me first thank you for the draft resolution on Doha and the continued support from Parliament and a very strong dedication to try to give Europe a strong voice in these international negotiations. I would also like to thank Mr Groote for his remarks and his very strong support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also looking forward to working with Parliament when we come to Doha. Some people tend to believe that while we have been so busy handling the economic crisis, maybe the climate crisis miraculously solved itself or just went away. For those people, there was some serious news today when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) presented its new Emissions Gap Report and nobody should be surprised that it clearly shows that we are not coming closer to where we needed to be now.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are distancing ourselves from it when we talk about it worldwide. The gap is widening. This is the context in which the Doha Conference will be held. That is of course also why we must do everything we can in Doha to secure the hard-won progress last year in Durban. The very carefully crafted package in Durban must be kept and we must move forward with the climate agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among other things this means that we must adopt a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol as part of the transition to the new future regime. We must agree the next steps towards adopting a legally binding agreement applicable to all parties by 2015, including through a streamlined negotiation process so that all negotiations can take place under the Durban Platform. This means that the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action (AWG-LCA) should be closed down and that when we leave Doha the focus will be on what should be the content in the 2015 agreement. Then of course – very importantly as well – we must address the mitigation gap and raising mitigation ambition also in the period up to 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Kyoto Protocol, I think there can be no doubt that Europe is ready to sign up to that. We can do immediate application. There is not doubt about that. I know that some say that you can also ratify when you come to Doha, but some of you will recall why in Bali in 2007 the whole world agreed that we should agree the new future regime at the latest by 2009 because we all knew that it would take years to ratify whatever the outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is of course still the case: ratification processes take some time and I think that more and more parties outside Europe understand that we have legal democratic procedures that we have to follow but the reality is that, as of 1 January, we will apply a new second commitment period and follow the Kyoto rules and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course it is important for this Conference of the Parties (COP) in Doha not to be reduced to a Kyoto COP only. It must also deliver progress on the other elements of the package from Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are working hard to reach agreement on outstanding Kyoto issues including the length of the second commitment period, access to Kyoto market mechanisms as well as environmental integrity related to the carry-over of Assigned Amount Unit carbon credits (AAUs) from the first commitment period.</p>
      <p sl="en">To make progress towards the 2015 agreement the EU has called for submissions and further informal sessions early next year in order to take forward key emerging themes.</p>
      <p sl="en">A major challenge for next year will be to explore how all parties will take on legally binding mitigation commitments in a way which is fair and consistent with their responsibilities and capabilities while being consistent with the science and thereby with the 2° target. In that respect we need to encourage our partner countries to start preparing for domestic policies accordingly or the consequence will be that we have a nice 2° target that we will not manage to stay below.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that when we leave Doha there must be a very clear idea, a very clear plan of who will have to do what and when between now and 2015 in order to get the agreement done by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say that we are all afraid of this looking into ‘low ambition’ and for many good reasons, also many developing countries are very concerned about that. That is why we have tried to push the incoming Qatari Presidency very much to secure that we will get a ministerial round table in Doha where ministers will sit down and discuss how to add on to ambition, and there are numerous things we could do.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cyprus Minister already mentioned some of them. We could also have cooperation on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies; we could include new gases. There are a whole range of things which can be done – also in the shorter term – and that is what we will want to push for. Sustainable energy for all as a follow-up to Rio+20 is another example of things that would serve several purposes at the one time, including the climate purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I say on climate financing there is no doubt that it is also very important when we come to Doha that we can prove in black and white – and we will present such a report proving this – that in Europe we have actually delivered on our fast-start climate financing pledges from Copenhagen. We have at this stage delivered a bit more than EUR 7.1 billion out of the EUR 7.2 billion pledged, and I know that the two remaining countries who have not yet come up with their bit for 2012 are working very hard to ensure that that can happen before Doha.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also strongly hope that the EU will maintain its efforts next year and in the coming years. This could also be secured by further mainstreaming climate considerations into development policy, but we should not fool ourselves. We will very much be watched to see whether some of our Member States and the EU as such are ready now, in Doha, to send some very clear signals about what can be expected financially in the years after the fast-start financing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know the Durban package was only possible because a group of countries drawn from all regional groupings and representing the ‘centre of gravity’, so to speak, came together last year in the spirit of ambition and compromise. In the year since Durban I have tried to continue to work with this Group. The Commission and the then Presidency, Denmark, convened a meeting in Brussels last May and we repeated that exercise with our good friends and allies among the developing countries in a session in New York. We are really trying to work together where we have shared interests in order to maximise pressure on those who need to move their position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr President, not all climate conferences, not all climate COPs, are very spectacular and can deliver very grand decisions, but that does not mean that they are not important. In Durban last year we knew that when we would meet in Doha it would be immediately after an American election, it would be just after the appointment of a new Chinese leadership.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that sense you can say that it is a preparatory COP where we are laying the building blocks for the future regime and trying to make progress on that. I really hope that is what we will achieve in Doha: handling the elements, creating the building blocks for the 2015 agreement which is incredibly important and in that sense that Doha will continue to deliver on future steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that in order to achieve that, it is as important as it was last year and in the previous years that we can speak with one voice in Europe and that we have this very good cooperation: Parliament, Presidency and Council and the European Commission. I think that last year we proved how much we can achieve when we all take part in the work in Doha. I look forward to your cooperation when we come to those two challenging weeks ahead of us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to underline that it was indeed a remarkable speech by President Schulz yesterday. It was a pleasure to listen to.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I do not believe that it was merely about giving support to the delegation in Doha. His speech also contained very clear warnings that in every aspect of climate policy, we need to think about maintaining the competitiveness of European industry and even expanding it again in some areas. For that reason, I thought it was a good speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">President-in-Office of the Council, I have heard a great deal of praise for you personally today, which is very gratifying, but the Council itself was divided over Doha and we were on the brink of seeing Europe falling out over a single issue and returning home looking ridiculous. Thankfully, that has been averted, but Europe is not as united as we are claiming here, Commissioner. These are critical words, but they are intended to be helpful, for there are some Member States that are not on track and we need to set them on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">These conferences are always held just before Christmas and in recent years and in keeping with the festive spirit – and I speak as someone who has been here for 20 years – the House has had the unfortunate tendency to put together what I can only describe as a wish list for these conferences. I am glad to say that we have now abandoned this ridiculous practice. Instead, we will be presenting moderate proposals with the aim of encouraging other people to move forward with us and vote in favour of rules. We have already agreed the principles: we have done that in Doha, and it was a hard enough job, but now we must follow up these principles with action, and in that respect, we still have a long way to go. This conference is not going to be easy. However, we should view it as a success that we are progressing step by step in the right direction, and that undoubtedly includes climate diplomacy as well. Europe’s entire energy industry has an energy output of 40 million tonnes. The burning of the forests in South America produces three times that amount. Even if we impose a zero emissions target on our industry, we still will not save the planet.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, diplomacy has a role to play. Lady Ashton needs to move forward on this issue and the Council must act quickly. Then we can rightly claim to have done something that will benefit our children. If we simply carry on as before and merely talk about principles, we are not worth the money that we are earning here.</p>

    <intervention id="3-336-000" speaker_id="28156" name="Dan Jørgensen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few days ago the World Bank published a new report: not Greenpeace, not Friends of the Earth, but the World Bank. It concluded that science tells us that if we do not fundamentally change the way we consume and produce energy now, then we risk having a temperature increase of 4°C within 60 years. Four degrees! If that happens, the consequences will be severe. In some places they will be devastating. The poorest countries and regions of this world will see effects such as desertification, a rise in sea levels, mass migration and, in some places, perhaps even conflict and war.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that the ambition to have a legally binding agreement in 2015, coming into force in 2020, is too late. It is not sufficiently ambitious. I know what you will say, Commissioner Hedegaard: that you agree with me, but that is what is possible. Well, we cannot negotiate with nature, so if that is what is possible then we simply have to acknowledge that it is not the way forward. We need to do something different.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can we as the European Union do? We cannot force other countries to follow us. We cannot force other countries to decrease their CO2 emissions because we do not have the hard power to do that, but we have something different, namely soft power. We have the power to inspire and to lead. If we go further than the rest – if we show that we can be competitive at the same time as doing the right things to save the climate – then maybe that is the best thing to do. That is why our group argues that we should be more ambitious, so that in 2020 we will reduce our emissions by 30 % instead of 20 %, and in 2030 we will need an equally ambitious target. I hope you will take our advice, Commissioner, and argue the same case in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, this Doha Conference is taking place at a difficult time – there is no point denying that – and we are actually facing a triple challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree entirely with what Mr Jørgensen said about the urgency of the situation, and we all know that he is right. I think that when future generations judge us, our place in history and what our generation did, it will be mainly on climate change that we will be judged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all know how difficult things are and, having followed three climate conferences, I have been able to see this for myself. Nevertheless, we have a historic responsibility, which means we have to take precise, concrete action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can no longer be satisfied with commitments for the future, financing that is innovative but ill-defined, quite simply because we are doing ourselves no favours. In addition to the issue of climate change, there is also the political issue of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I completely agree, Commissioner, with what you said a moment ago about Europe having to speak with one voice. At a time when we are the subject of so much criticism around the world, I think that we can not only take the initiative but also demonstrate how to reconcile the economic dimension, economic development, the interests of our businesses and new industrial sectors with a tireless fight against climate change to ensure the survival of future generations and humanity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that we have a real responsibility in that regard because if there is one region in the world that has the capacity to demonstrate that, it is Europe. Nowhere else could because for the southern countries, development aspects come before climate issues, and for the United States, the economy takes priority over the climate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are the only ones on the planet today who can really respond to this challenge. In my view, we all realise that and that is why we have to be ambitious, demanding of others, but also and perhaps above all, demanding of ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the EU’s Council of Ministers to detach itself from the paralysing unanimity requirement in the climate negotiations and switch to a normal qualified majority in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the eyes of the rest of the world, our self-congratulatory speeches about how ambitious we are appear to be risible when we have not even been able to make a decision on so-called hot-air recovery in terms of emissions rights. It is time to wake up climate policy. Mr Jørgensen has already referred to the new report from the World Bank, which warns that we are heading for warming by four degrees, which would mean a rise in the sea level of up to a metre during this century, as well as dry areas becoming even drier, rainy areas becoming even rainier, and disproportionate suffering for hundreds of millions and even billions of people.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is self-deception to claim that meeting our 20 % reduction target is a success when just last year our reduction was at 17.5 %. Tightening up the emissions target to a reduction of at least 30 % whilst at the same time encouraging the rest of the world to step up to the mark is the decent thing to do, and our global obligation, just as Ms Lepage said.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We keep repeating that warming must be restricted and kept below two degrees, even though we know very well that our current emissions target does not meet this climate objective. It is high time for us to switch to actions in our emissions-limit objectives that correspond to limiting global warming to two degrees.</p>

It is wrong, however, to ask the European Union to take steps unilaterally to cut emissions by 50 % over the levels of the 1990s by 2050.</p>
      <p sl="it">It should be evident that if we continue to depress European industry, we encourage relocation of large enterprises to third countries. Unlike the members of the committee, I consider the Durban Package to be insufficient because no binding global agreement was reached on reduction of emissions. It is sheer madness to think of embarking on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol unilaterally, in the absence of the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, with uncertainty regarding Australia and New Zealand, and knowing that the great polluters such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to lack emissions reduction targets.</p>

The survival of the small island states and the least developed countries is still at risk from climate change. In Doha, the Green Climate Fund agreed in 2010 must be established, and a decision is also needed on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012.</p>

It is clear that the industrialised countries must take responsibility for providing this funding. As long as the industrialised and emerging countries are at odds with each other and deploy blockading tactics, Doha will not produce any positive outcomes for the global climate.

      <p sl="de">I welcome the fact that Europe is taking on a lead role in this context. Connie Hedegaard is a particularly fervent champion of these goals in the international arena. However, we must also remind our Member States that a joint approach is very important if we want to achieve these ambitious targets. However, I must also remind everyone that protecting the climate is a task for the international community as a whole, and we must be mindful of the realities: nowadays, Europe produces only around 10 % of global emissions. There is no disputing that we have an historic responsibility: during early industrialisation here in Europe and, of course, in America as well, we undoubtedly contributed significantly to the problems we face today. This lead role is therefore justified, but as already stated, we must also ensure that Europe remains attractive as a place to do business. It is a fact that our companies produce the lowest CO2 emissions. Driving our industries out of Europe would therefore be extremely damaging to the climate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, with regard to the issue of aviation, I would ask you to make vigorous efforts to ensure that this international agreement actually comes into being. You told the Committee that you would stop the clock. That is a good thing. We said that we would accept that for one year, but it must also be clear that we need some movement after that; otherwise, our European rules will come into effect. Some people have described this as ‘giving in’; however we describe it, it should not result in the exclusion of this key industry from our shared commitments.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, at the climate summit in Cancun the target was for a global temperature increase of 1.5°C, which was described as the limit for what the Earth can tolerate without very dramatic consequences.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In Durban, this was changed to a target of 2°C, and at the start of this week the prognosis was issued that current climate policy is leading us towards 4°C of warming, which is a very frightening figure. The question that very many people are asking me is this: is it already too late?</p>
      <p sl="sv">What measures and decisions can interrupt such a strong negative trend? Is it possible at all?</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must try to answer these questions. What we must also do in Doha is ensure that the EU can appear to agree, as many people here have already pointed out, but also work out how we will get China and the US back to the common negotiating table in earnest.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It may be hoped that the new governments and leaders in the US and China are prepared to take new steps, but in actual fact it depends on us. We did well last time, but we have to do even better. We must contribute to a concrete result and help people continue to have hope.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, if the world warmed by 4°C we would see a torrent of disasters, including extreme heat waves, a reduction in food stocks and a rise in sea level, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Those words are not taken from the Doha briefing brochure of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, as you know, from the World Bank report, which also states that the fight against global warming is an economic opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it seems that the international negotiations are not making any headway and are waiting for 2015. We must obviously avoid what led to the Copenhagen failure: trying to reach an agreement right before the end of Copenhagen and not preparing it adequately beforehand. Doha is an extremely important meeting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It seems that conservatism of all kinds is taking precedence over the urgency and the new economy, especially this new carbon-free economy, so the European Union needs to set an example. Here, once again, the Union seems to be dragging its feet: when it comes to aviation, climate change caused by agrofuels, the restriction on the coal market and ‘hot air’, the European Union’s most recent decisions have been bad decisions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that you are ambitious, Commissioner. We need to be ambitious in Doha and we need to continue to try to convince your colleagues in the Commission and us in the European Parliament to ensure that Europe continues to lead the way.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, there are many who could question why we are even having this conference, since we are achieving nothing.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The media reports are truly sceptical, but I myself was surprised when I checked what indeed had happened from Bali to the present day. It is very important for me that a global agreement was achieved that the temperature should not exceed two degrees Celsius, but of course there are emission limits tied to this.</p>
      <p sl="sl">A green climate fund was set up, as well as an instrument for technology transfer, and of course negotiations are still ongoing in many areas.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Yet it is true that the most important agreement on how far countries will reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and bind themselves legally to doing so has not yet been reached. It is also true that those commitments already communicated are still far from reaching the target that we are all aiming for.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For this reason we MEPs must be extremely determined in our talks with colleagues in Doha. We must tell them that we have to be more ambitious and that we need to take action now.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In this regard the crisis should of course not be an excuse. For if we act now, it will require about 1 % of gross domestic product, while if we do not act, it will require about 5 % of gross domestic product and we really cannot leave this burden to our children.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I must also point out another thing. Climate change is a global problem, and action must also be global. I believe that responses calling for a unilateral increase of ambitions in our resolution are redundant.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Parliament has full faith in the Commissioner. We know that she is a woman who not only tries to do her best but someone who does the best possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The target, as we see it, is not a success in Doha. The target is a success in the negotiations for an agreement in 2015. This is a country-by-country fight. We are fighting to win the hearts and minds of people and bureaucracies, each time in one more country and then in another and another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Qatar has been one of the difficult partners in this negotiation. Now it holds in its hands the very future of these negotiations for an agreement in 2015 – for one whole year. May it be that, by the end of COP 18, Qatar becomes a pioneer in these negotiations. It has, as you also told us yesterday, the highest per capita income in the world. May it be a main and important contributor for climate action across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the message that comes from the Parliament is that you are not going to Doha empty-handed. A year ago we had the decision in Durban on LULUCF. As you might know, we, with the Council, are way ahead in negotiations for a decision on LULUCF legislation. This is a clear commitment from our side that we believe in these negotiations and that we are willing to do everything to make them a reality.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Hedegaard and the President-in-Office, Mr Mavroyiannis, for their fine words once more about climate change and how serious the situation is. Here too, in Parliament, a great deal of concern has been expressed once again about how serious climate change is. However, while we know that this summit will not achieve the biggest steps, if we face reality we are forced to note what kind of problems the EU has already had in coming to a position. It is time, therefore, to be a bit more critical of Mr Mavroyiannis and Commissioner Hedegaard too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When, for instance, is Europe finally going to agree on rules to ensure that the hot air from Kyoto I is not taken along to Kyoto II? When will the EU finally provide some clarity on that? Then there is the funding! Ms Hedegaard has said very clearly: ‘I am building up an alliance of the poorer countries, the African Union’. Money is very important to the African Union. They are already noticing the effects of climate change. When I read the conclusions of Ecofin, the Ministers of Finance, they do not contain anything concrete about what the EU is going to do about money after 2012. What promises will the EU make on this in Doha? I would like to hear something more specific, clearer statements, from the EU, about what they are going to put down in Doha. Otherwise it will just be empty words and the climate gains nothing from that.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, because she works tirelessly in this area – I can vouch for that – especially given that this topic that we are discussing is really very complicated. I would also add the following.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is one area, Commissioner, in which we have demonstrated that we definitely can reduce emissions –indeed, we are seeing its positive impact on growth, competitiveness and, therefore, job creation – and in which Europe is a leader in the technological sphere and is carrying out many actions with specific objectives: that area is energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have said it before and I will say it again now. I believe that Doha, like the last COP in Durban, is a great opportunity for Europe, and the European Union, to head up the development of a road map for energy efficiency, with different types of goals, with common actions, with deadlines, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">This really needs a precise structure and framework, and the European Union, more than anyone, has an undeniable opportunity to pioneer a road map for energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in no easy situation, because – as the previous speakers pointed out – it will be very difficult to achieve a result in Doha. For me it was very convincing how Commissioner Hedegaard tackled the issue, as was the forcefulness with which she presented her views. I believe this is the only way to represent the European position. However, we must not hide the fact that we also disagree on a number of important issues. This was apparent in the Committee debate, but also in the preparatory phase in this House. We should not forget that most of the commitments undertaken in the period up to 2012 were introduced by the central and eastern European states, which thereby took the EU commitments on their shoulders. This same region is set to fare badly in the next period if the quotas cannot be carried over. I therefore think that we should bear in mind the proposals which were tabled by the Hungarian government at the Durban conference, and we should do everything possible to present a united front. As my colleague Mr Florenz said, otherwise there will be no unity, and we need to be able to carry across these quotas to the following period … (The President cut off the speaker)</p>

      <p sl="hu">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the climate summit that begins next week in Doha is our last chance to get answers to one of the biggest global challenges facing humankind. I completely agree with Commissioner Hedegaard’s position, but it would be good to obtain our partners’ support too, notably that of the US, China and Russia and the other emerging economies. As Mr Bánki also said, it is especially important for the central European Member States that the Kyoto emissions system should remain in place, as otherwise we new Member States, including Hungary, stand to lose substantial sums of money. In Hungary’s case this money is badly needed for renewable energy, energy efficiency and the programme to refurbish old prefabricated housing stock. In other words, we have a significant interest in ensuring that this system continues and that we can access the funds that are rightfully ours.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with all the crises going on in the world – the eurozone one, the fiscal cliff in the US, a nuclear Iran etc. – climate change has slipped somewhat down the political agenda. But Hurricane Sandy was a bit of a wake-up call, and I do now hope that President Obama in his second term will act decisively.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say that the anthropogenic debate regarding climate change is not entirely settled in my mind, but nevertheless I do support the EU 2020 mitigation agenda, although I worry that the higher, 30 %, reduction target for emissions might put my country’s economy at a severe competitive disadvantage, and unless the other major players in the world, such as the US, Canada, Japan and the BRICs, all sign up at the 2015 Doha Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, we will have problems for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must speak with one voice – and that is not entirely settled either – but we cannot go it alone to stop this global threat to future generations by stabilising the temperature rise below 2°C – which must be our objective. Otherwise we face serious problems of desertification, rising ocean levels and mass migration as agriculture and global fishery stocks are depleted.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in time when we are preparing for yet another conference on climate change, there are two issues that we should be discussing in more detail. The first is the carbon market. The European Union, in its rush to create yet another refuge for financial speculators and to commit to creating yet another mechanism for generating billions from fictitious financial assets, has opted for a market approach instead of a regulatory approach, which could and should have been used. This begs the question: when will the manifest perversity of market instruments be recognised? It is not by rushing to remove a few more licences from the market that the basic problem will be solved. The second issue is the liberalisation and deregulation of trade. The same European Union, which appears to be deeply concerned about climate change, is pursuing, on a global scale, the liberalisation and deregulation of trade. This is significantly increasing flows of energy and materials and, therefore, CO2 emissions associated with meeting the most basic human needs. When, too, will this irreconcilable contradiction be resolved?</p>

You know better than I do the importance of preparatory work, and therefore also of diplomatic activity, with countries and governments who have either underestimated or are openly hostile to the questions to be dealt with at Doha.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I believe that in the light of the data presented in the World Bank document we have to introduce a new concept in addition to the larger and generally accepted question that underlies these discussions: we are faced with a veritable environmental emergency, since global climate temperature increase does not progress in a linear fashion and beyond a certain threshold even a single degree increase in temperature could have devastating effects.</p>
      <p sl="it">The aims and the schedule established in the EU position are acceptable, but we must also contemplate a more immediate form of intervention reflecting an emergency situation.</p>

    <intervention id="3-356-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be brief. You will all know from what I said earlier that I agree very much with the sense of urgency, and I see we are getting much additional evidence that we did not actually need – although I hope it will help the world to try to act more speedily, for that is what we need.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Jørgensen said we could not negotiate with nature. Unfortunately that is so, although I think it might be easier than the negotiations in Doha with 194 countries. There have been so many wake-up calls that the question is, do we really need any more? Personally I hope that what President Obama said last week at his first press conference after having been re-elected President, when he admitted – and he used the word ‘admit’ – that the US had not been doing enough on climate, means he will now change that. I hope that in Doha we will start to see signs of that being reflected when it comes to international negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Corinne Lepage asked about innovative financing. Here I would refer to this month’s Ecofin Council conclusions, of 13 November, when aviation and shipping revenues were mentioned, as were carbon markets: so there actually are some alternative sources of revenue. Last year in Durban, we established a new market mechanism and we hope now that it can come into action. I strongly agree that we need innovative sources to generate the kind of amounts we need.</p>
      <p sl="en">To echo Mr Eickhout, what will the EU say about financing? I hope that when we come to Doha, on behalf of the Commission, I will have an adopted, agreed multiannual financial framework (MFF) so that I can point to the fact that there is substantial new money for climate action, for access to energy and for many of these things, with a particular focus on Africa – a point that was mentioned by Mr Eickhout. What I cannot guarantee is what will come from the various Member States but I know that, last year in Durban, some of them – Germany, for instance, Denmark and others, and I think the UK too – indicated they are now ready to come up with more financing for 2013. I was told I could make that point in Council. I think Mr Eickhout will not be surprised if I say I have tried to make that point pretty clearly many times, so I hope it will work out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, many of you have mentioned that Europe should show leadership: should lead by example through what we do ourselves. I must say that I am quite proud of the pile of proposals from the Commission that we have at this stage here in Parliament, and also on the table for the Council. To mention just a few, they include the back-loading proposal, the carbon market report with the structural options for the carbon market, the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) proposal that Mr Arsenis mentioned, the Cars regulation and the F-Gas Regulation; and we had the proposal for a 20 % climate mainstreaming of the entire MFF.</p>
      <p sl="en">I tell you, this is no small thing. It is a new way of thinking – if it actually gets through. The Energy Efficiency Directive has been adopted but it is now very much up to the Member States to actually implement it. We also have the Energy Taxation Directive. So there is no question of our not providing the initiatives, but we now need to get them through our various institutions so we can incorporate them into law.</p>
      <p sl="en">In these final seconds I would also like to highlight the fact that, in the Commission’s work programme for next year, we have announced that we will prepare a 2030 initiative on both climate and energy, so I hope we can have some useful discussions about the target we will need for 2030.</p>
      <p sl="en">My very last point is that I know some will say ‘Yes, but this is costly and we have an economic crisis’. But what the US has just experienced with Hurricane Sandy is merely one example of what we will see increasingly, and further proof that continuing with ‘business as usual’ carries a very high price tag. The droughts we saw in the US this summer, the flooding in many areas of the world: this is what it takes to convince people that, yes, the green transition does not come for free, but in the end it pays off, even economically and growth-wise, compared to simply continuing with ‘business as usual’. The more people realise that, the better off we will be in this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Doha is not going to be an easy conference but we actually managed to get very substantial things out of Durban despite all the predictions. I hope that Doha can deliver some new progress and keep us on track to construct the international agreement. Although it can never stand alone, we need it, and Doha will be the next stepping stone.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very much encouraged by this afternoon’s debate, which shows that both our institutions and, of course, the Commission very much share the same objective and are working along the same lines.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a brief comment on stepping up to 30 %, a subject raised by a number of speakers. The cornerstone of the EU contribution to the global goals is set out in the EU climate and energy legislative package. The EU has adopted an ambitious, independent target for mitigation to reduce emissions to 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020. By continuing to both fulfil its present commitment and affirm its willingness to move conditionally to a reduction of up to 30 %, the EU hopes that its example will help stimulate stronger commitments from other major economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the EU advocates a mid-term review in 2014, offering the possibility to review the level of ambition. It is noteworthy that this review will thus be able to take into account the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
      <p sl="en">As on previous occasions, your support and outreach efforts to our partners worldwide in the run-up to the Doha Conference, as well as on the spot, are very much appreciated. May I just add that we have the privilege to have, in Commissioner Connie Hedegaard and her team, the perfect synthesis of vigilance, knowledge of the dossier, vision and full commitment to make us rise to the challenge, along with the Council negotiating team – to use our soft power and to lead by example, but without overlooking interdependence and the need for global and comprehensive effort. We very much look forward to working closely together with all of you in order to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There is an urgent need to fill the gap between the available scientific data and the current commitments of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to a United Nations study published this week, levels of greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise and are 14 % above the 2020 targets. A rise in temperature of 3-5°C is predicted in this century, if rapid action is not taken. All the governments meeting in Doha need to raise their level of ambition to ensure that a legally binding global agreement is achieved to limit the planet’s warming to 2°C. The costs of inaction are well-documented and will be even higher if reductions in emissions are postponed to subsequent decades. The crisis should not therefore reduce the level of ambition in Doha. The European Union must give new impetus to the international climate negotiations and invest in the transition to a green economy, demonstrating that emissions can be reduced without losing competitiveness and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Many people felt the international climate negotiations were a failure because they did not manage to arrive at a binding agreement. Based on the negotiations so far it seems that we need to reconcile ourselves to the idea that small steps are a better way to achieve success than grand convergences. In the 2013-2020 commitment period one such forward-looking measure might be to establish an international financing structure that could provide an suitable basis for common funding to combat climate change. The setting up of the Green Climate Fund seems a promising initiative, but we must make sure that the big polluters mobilise their resources to support it in spite of the economic crisis. Alongside international efforts, an important aspect is to ensure that European Union climate policy does not disadvantage Member States that have managed to reduce their emissions by more than the levels stipulated in the international Convention. In recent years the countries of central and eastern Europe have more than fulfilled their Kyoto commitments and in accordance with the Convention will be able to carry over their surplus into the post-2012 commitment period. In the current difficult economic climate the EU proposal to limit the rights of countries to carry over their surplus units is unacceptable. In the interests of stimulating economic growth in Europe it is vital that countries with surplus units, which represent an important national asset, should be able to trade these beyond 2012 as the income from this trade could be used to invest in renewables and energy efficiency measures.</p>

Every year we do this, our objective being to give the Commission a signal of the direction in which Parliament wants the Commission to steer the meeting. From year to year, however, as I read the resolutions, it feels as though time has stood still; we still repeat the same hopes that we have found to be unachievable about the EU being in charge and showing the way, as if someone were to follow our example. We are clinging onto Kyoto by force, as if Kyoto’s model strategy and its emissions limits were the only way of saving the climate. We do not want to acknowledge the facts, even to such an extent that some of my colleagues in the Greens want to vote against my two reviews, which merely state the facts: the Durban package in total covers approximately 15 % of the world’s emissions, and the US, Russia, Japan and Canada at least will not be participating in any possible second Kyoto commitment period. At the same time, I want to remind you that developing countries like China, India, Brazil and Indonesia still do not have any targets for reducing emissions in the coming period. If we want to take the fight against climate change seriously, we must consider the facts and understand that we badly need something more effective and comprehensive in its place. Ironically, those who play around the most with the catastrophic impact of climate change are themselves the first to deny the proven ineffectiveness of the action that is currently being taken, and state that they are unwilling to update their weapons. Therefore, it is finally time to embark on the negotiations from a new basis, with our objective being to find a real solution in which others are also prepared to accompany us.

      <p sl="en">Europe has taken the lead over the most ambitious line in the UNFCCC which it will defend in December in Doha. If the EU is a pioneer in pointing out climate change as a threat and understanding the urgency for climate mitigation, we also acknowledge the need for all parties to adopt ambitious and sufficient targets for the GHG reduction, and to convince the big polluters that we face an issue which needs to be addressed at international level through strong commitments. The EU’s Low Carbon Roadmap and the promotion of renewables and energy efficiency show an effective political will at EU level. Nevertheless, these are derisory if never implemented at international level. Durban put the foundation for an all-parties’ comprehensive, ambitious, international legally binding agreement to be reached by 2015 and implemented by 2020. But these commitments are still unclear and our current policies are clearly insufficient to meet the objective of limiting the surface temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. I am proud to be on the side of those who do not live in blindness but I know that the actions we undertake against climate change will be worthless without international awareness and equal participation in our efforts.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members, Commissioner Füle and all those who contributed to the preparation of this strategic report by the European Parliament. The report comes at a crucial moment. At a time when the economic crisis is eating away at the fabric of Europe in many countries, both inside and outside the European Union, there is talk of enlargement fatigue.</p>
      <p sl="el">The primary aim of this report, then, is to underline the importance of the enlargement policy: a policy which has demonstrably been the most successful expression of the Union’s external action and which represents the essence of its soft power. For decades now, enlargement has indeed contributed to strengthening peace in Europe. It has been a decisive factor in the reunification of the continent after the end of the Cold War, and continues to provide an incentive for further reforms and democratisation in the countries looking forward to accession. This contribution was recently recognised with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, and it would be a huge mistake to downgrade or simply abandon the enlargement policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">The disappointment which some people feel is nevertheless justified. The Union seems to be raising the bar higher and higher, while statements by European politicians have at times damaged its credibility, particularly as regards its ability to integrate or absorb a particular country.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report confirms the central role of the Copenhagen criteria and attaches great importance to the policy of conditionality. However, this policy must be transparent and fair in relation to candidate countries. What the Union is asking of each country individually must be absolutely clear from the start. At the same time, all the specific steps must be defined from the outset with benchmarks allowing objective evaluation of a country’s progress.</p>
      <p sl="el">During the current economic crisis, which gives rise to justified fears and insecurity about the future, better information and promotion is needed regarding the benefits of the enlargement process. This is important both for EU citizens and for the citizens of candidate countries. However, the main question hanging in the balance is the credibility of the Union: when and if a candidate country meets all the necessary criteria for accession, there should be no doubt that it will be accepted into the European family. The credibility of the Union’s promise of accession is a necessary component of the conditionality policy. It must therefore be guaranteed if we are to retain our ability to favourably influence developments in the countries that are candidates for accession.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Commission’s new negotiating approach which puts the rule of law and fundamental rights at the heart of the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="el">I look forward to the debate, and my thanks once again to all those who helped in the drafting of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Koppa, for her excellent report on enlargement. I welcome the report’s acknowledgement that enlargement is a successful European Union policy and has to remain in the Union’s toolbox.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is largely in line with and supportive of the Commission’s approach, in particular on the balance between conditionality/integration capacity, on the one hand, and maintaining the momentum of the enlargement process, on the other. I am pleased with the emphasis in the report on benchmarking; on the necessary link between the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) objectives and the requirements of the accession criteria; on greater involvement of civil society and the social partners in the accession process; and on associating the enlargement countries with the Europe 2020 goals. This is all in line with the Commission’s policy, as reflected in this year’s enlargement strategy communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn now to some of the issues raised in the report, starting with the methodology. As you know, the Commission is actively engaged in the process of constantly improving the enlargement methodology. With the new approach on chapters 23 and 24, we have taken seriously the lessons learned in previous enlargements and have proposed a concrete way of reflecting them in future. The two chapters will now be opened as early as possible and should be among the last ones to be closed. This will allow the accession countries sufficient time to develop solid and sustainable track records.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree on the need for a focus on ‘social challenges’ at times when this dimension is of the utmost importance in both the enlargement countries and the EU. The initiative for a new dialogue with the enlargement countries on employment and social reform programmes, as set out in this year’s strategy paper, responds to that need.</p>
      <p sl="en">On open bilateral issues, it is important that these are addressed as early as possible in the enlargement process, with determination, in a good-neighbourly spirit and taking into account overall EU interests. Bilateral issues should not hold up the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the acknowledgment in the report that the Copenhagen criteria continue to be the fundamental basis and should remain at the heart of enlargement policy. The Commission considers that the existing basis remains relevant and adequate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission always keeps policies under review, taking account of developments and lessons learned, and we are open to discussing further refinements. We have taken note of the comments in the report on the need to simplify and reduce the administrative burden associated with IPA funding. I agree with these comments and, largely thanks to the lessons learned from the current IPA instrument and feedback from the various stakeholders, our IPA II proposal addresses this need.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by thanking you, honourable Members, for your continued support for our enlargement policy. With your support, I am confident that enlargement will remain a strong and credible policy, with the rule of law at its centre, for the benefit of the citizens of the enlargement countries and the European Union as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The enlargement process faces a new type of financial problem, namely the risk of inappropriate cuts to the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance in the next financial framework, thereby rendering the negotiations with applicant countries fruitless. Let me remind you that when a decision was taken about 20 years ago to enlarge the European Community to include Eastern Europe, hardly anyone could have imagined the speed with which the entire system would turn around and how quickly the values of the market economy and rule of law would be embraced. I would say that the Eastern enlargement has been the most successful and the most European project of the European Union because it has led to incredible economic, social and political changes in the lives of many in a short space of time. The Nobel Prize was awarded to the European Union precisely to support cooperation for peace and as a reminder of these extraordinary achievements.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is a policy that has no equivalent at national level. It is not an infrastructure policy or an agricultural subsidy but an investment in the future of this continent. Let us not, however, treat it completely as an end in itself. We must reinvigorate this investment, through innovative financial instruments for instance, in order to better concentrate our financial resources, with the assistance and cooperation of our partners in the most transparent and useful projects, in accordance with sustainable national policies.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Ms Koppa on an excellent report. I wish to highlight the good timing of this report, 20 years after the Copenhagen European Council that adopted the accession criteria for enlargement and in the midst of the latest economic crisis. It is useful to remind ourselves of how both the European Union citizens and the citizens from candidate or potential candidate countries have benefited from the European Union’s enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As underlined by one of the amendments to the resolution, enlargement has had a significant impact, not only on candidate states, but also on the European Union as a whole. Enlargement is always an opportunity to better define the identity, objectives and policies of the European Union. It is also an opportunity to better communicate these to the European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As the rapporteur for the accession of Iceland, I regret that the enlargement process focuses almost exclusively on the Western Balkans and less on the other candidate or potential candidate states. Commissioner Füle and I have just returned from visiting our Icelandic colleagues. The report is not particularly relevant to them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also wish to express my profound disagreement with paragraph 38, which introduces a new category, that of European Union associate members. I believe that the enlargement policy reflects the openness of the European project, which is meant to unite all European countries in an ever stronger Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will end by highlighting the enlargement potential of countries such as Moldova, which, while geographically European, can only accede if they implement all of the reforms needed to allow them to join Europe politically too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is really an excellent report. We have discussed this a number of times in the Foreign Affairs Committee with colleagues from Member States and with colleagues from enlargement countries and I think that we have produced a really remarkable result, and I congratulate Mrs Koppa for all the work she has done.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report details the achievements and the shortcomings of the enlargement process and there is also an assessment and a number of recommendations on how it should go on. Enlargement however is not a technical process and we often forget this. This is a very political process. I must say that Mr Füle, the Commissioner on Enlargement, has made history these last three years making this processes credible enough and carrying the stick and the carrot hoping to unlock and unblock: to unlock internal political situations; to unblock bilateral issues. And all this must be very irritating sometimes; at least it is for me to see when countries or political parties do not see the bigger goal, the bigger idea behind that process.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have invented a positive agenda on Turkey and a high-level accession dialogue for Macedonia. I wonder what the next bright idea is just to keep the process going while countries block each other. Looking at the technicalities we sometimes forget the dream about a united Europe; we forget about the great ideas of peace, solidarity, mutual support, cooperation and dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We talk only of criteria, requirements, benchmarks, indicators, roadmaps – let us talk also about why the European Union was born. Why the unification – what I call unification and not enlargement in 2005 and 2007 – has happened and has taken place and why this cannot be completed without the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">My time is running out but I would really like to call on the Council, particularly, but also the Commission and the Parliament, to make sure that in the next seven-year period there will be enough financing for the enlargement process and that we make sure that this process can continue successfully and we do not fight over words in the trialogues which are in front of us and taking place right now but that we think about the big idea and make compromises for the future of our Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would also like to say though that I am the first speaker up to now to come from one of the founding Member States of the European Union. All the others are from countries which joined the Union at different stages later, which goes to show how much the gradual enlargement of the Union is a fundamental aspect of its existence and is among the most successful policies developed over the years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We will approve this report because we agree with it, as I said, because we do believe that, generally speaking, the enlargement of the European Union can be said to have been successful. We also agree with the new approach that Commissioner Füle has proposed and developed and which includes opening chapters 23 and 24 very early during negotiations and keeping them open a long time. That should prevent painful surprises at the end of the journey and, above all, give applicant countries time to properly implement difficult reforms in the field of justice and fundamental freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report contains paragraph 38, which has just been discussed. Some members of my group, myself included, will not approve this, not so much because we are against the idea of associate membership as such, but because we regret that it has found its way into a report on enlargement.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Maria Eleni Koppa’s report affirms enlargement and accession, which are at the core and the heart of this European Union. As others have said before, many of us would not be here without enlargement. Annemarie Neyts-Uyttebroeck and others would be sitting here among very few. So this is the important part of this enlargement report and I would like to thank Maria Eleni Koppa for the good work and the good cooperation she has done, and also thank Commissioner Füle, to support him in the efforts he is making.</p>
      <p sl="en">Enlargement needs many things. I can just mention a few. It means visa liberalisation, freedom to travel for people, the fight against corruption and it also means involving civil society. This is essential. We ask the Commission and Council to start developing an arbitration mechanism to resolve bilateral and multilateral disputes.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rapporteur for Kosovo, I would like to ask fellow MEPs to vote tomorrow in favour of deleting the footnote on Kosovo in paragraph 28, following in line with what this Parliament has been doing since Kosovo declared independence in 2008: supporting the independence of Kosovo.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group is of the view that EU enlargement is a success story, but we also support a more flexible, variable EU geometry in any new proposed future European Union treaty allowing some countries to integrate further than others.</p>
      <p sl="en">As countries develop politically and economically, it is perfectly correct and right that they should be able to contribute to the EU and share in the EU citizens’ prosperity, and in my role as rapporteur for Montenegro, an EU candidate, I have witnessed first hand that country’s strides towards eventual accession, although it looks as if its entry into the EU will not be for at least another ten years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other countries such as Serbia and Macedonia are also making great progress and deserve to be included in our club, although a solution must clearly be found for the Greek veto on Macedonia’s name question. Other general issues such as corruption and organised crime must also be tackled in the Western Balkans, but we can look forward to good news stories as well. Croatia’s entry next year is to be welcomed and if little Iceland’s electorate votes to join the EU, then we will be happy to see them in the EU fold as well. An economic block of over 30 countries in the future, with more than 500 million people, would be a serious force to be reckoned with in the world.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate Ms Koppa on her excellent report. The report confirms the European Parliament’s commitment to the enlargement policy, and introduces innovative approaches to the improvement of this policy. New realities such as the economic crisis, and also global challenges, call for a new approach to enlargement. With this in mind, Ms Koppa has given us a number of interesting proposals. Particularly welcome is the recommendation set out in the report that bilateral disputes should be settled before the start of accession talks. I also welcome the proposal to introduce performance indicators and benchmarks into the accession process, so that it becomes more transparent and democratic; and the proposal to strengthen the social dimension of government by strengthening the participation of civil society. Potential enlargement, subject to observance of the Copenhagen criteria and dedication to the European acquis and its values, is a tool for strengthening the Union. The Bible says: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth’. Personally I hope that the unravelling of the European Union, evidently under way at present, will be short-lived.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am sorry but this report on enlargement policy shows a disconcerting unworldliness. At no point, for instance, does it ask the question whether the European Union does not have better things to do right now than further enlargement by adding new Member States. I am thinking of the euro crisis, the problems with Schengen, the problems with the multiannual budget, the democratic deficit, etc. Perhaps I missed it, but no part of this report deals with the European Union’s capacity to absorb certain applicant countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report also contains a number of flagrant contradictions. Paragraph 28, for example, is taken up by the so-called positive agenda for Turkey, while the next paragraph emphasises that applicant countries must improve in the areas of democracy and human rights. As far as Turkey is concerned, this really is quite a euphemism. Either applicant countries meet the standards for accession or they do not. Turkey did not even meet the standard to start accession negotiations and since then the problems in that country have only got worse. Do not forget all those academics and journalists who are behind bars for expressing their opinions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Parliament should use plain language for once and argue for stopping the negotiations with Turkey. That is a very different things from the propaganda in paragraph 35 of the report which argues for softening up public opinion, public opinion which – it must be said – usually shows more common sense and is more realistic than all the EU institutions put together when it comes to the problems associated with enlargement.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in the last decade, one of the Union’s greatest successes has undoubtedly been the enlargement process. There is a series of principles that must govern, or must continue to govern, that process. I am referring to consolidation, conditionality and communication with the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another important prerequisite is the EU’s integration capacity. Does this principle still apply, as Ms Koppa’s report rightly suggests? Will we have resources in the future to finance the common policies or cohesion?</p>
      <p sl="es">I ask this because far-reaching cuts are being proposed for the new financial perspective, precisely in the funds for those policies, and others, too.</p>
      <p sl="es">Is that the European Union that we want in the future? Is that the way to prepare for future enlargements?</p>
      <p sl="es">Paradoxically, sometimes the greatest defenders of enlargement are those who most want to reduce the EU budget. We are also seeing the difficulty of having 27 Member States when taking decisions to tackle the serious crisis and strengthen the economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Sometimes, it takes a great deal of time to apply political decisions and that does not set a good example for future enlargements. It is possible that some of our own citizens cannot understand either how the European Union, with so many difficulties, will be able to cope with new enlargement challenges.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would add a small point: I am very pleased that the Koppa report incorporates the idea of creating a specific curricular element on the Union in secondary schools. It is the best way for young generations to find out about the Union and learn more about the enlargement process.</p>
      <p sl="es">My last point is that I cannot support the removal of the footnote from paragraph 28; it is the same formulation as that used by the Council and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year’s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately. Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively. It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU’s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States. Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement. It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance. An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we must send out a clear signal. Firstly, we want to keep the EU’s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity. Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us. Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented. We know from experience that ‘rebates’ are not helpful here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the rapporteur seems to be looking at many aspects through rose-tinted spectacles, especially as regards the Copenhagen criteria. I cannot see any positive developments in Turkey, for example. Freedom of expression, press freedom, freedom of religion, women’s rights: these are unresolved issues with no solution in sight.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the report, candidate and potential candidate countries should have resolved any disputes with their neighbours prior to accession, particularly those concerning territorial issues. My question is this: where is the solution to the Cyprus issue? Indeed, it is the EU that has to foot the bill. This year alone, we paid EUR 860 million to Turkey in so-called pre-accession assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The critical situation along the Syrian border highlights the additional dangers associated with Turkish accession. When the European Coal and Steel Community was founded exactly 60 years ago in 1952, its founders’ main aim was to achieve lasting peace in Europe. We simply have to recognise that, as is quite apparent from the present situation, accession by Turkey, which has a border to Syria and is a front-line state in the Middle East conflict, would mean bringing ongoing military conflicts into the heart of the European Union.</p>

As a committed supporter of enlargement, I think that we should have a clear and sharp vision in this respect. This is for our future’s sake and for the sake of the accession countries. We need to be able to articulate problems and show the direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Enlargement has been a successful process so far. Despite the challenges the Union and the accession countries are facing now, I still believe it could bring further benefits to us all. The EU therefore has to strengthen its position in this process. If we want to drive the process forward, we need to show the ability to contribute substantially to the solution of such critical issues like the name issue of Macedonia, Kosovo or the future of Bosnia Herzegovina. It is good that things are moving on, yet we need stronger commitment and a clear vision not just to move things but also to achieve goals.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Maria Eleni Koppa for this excellent report, which was supported by the vast majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">In spite of the crisis, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports unreservedly the European Union’s enlargement policy because it has proven to be the most effective tool for consolidating democracy and stability in the candidate countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have also spoken out against alternatives to accession, such as privileged associations or other proposals that reduce the expectations of accession and its effects in terms of democratisation, human rights and economic prosperity. In difficult circumstances, such as those that we are currently experiencing, a lack of solidarity and populist policies threaten our plan for social, political and economic cohesion, which we must continue to construct.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, the Committee on Foreign Affairs rejected a series of amendments that sought to distort the debate on enlargement and it has already made it clear that any future accession process will have to follow the existing procedures, will require unanimity among the Member States and will, under no circumstances, go beyond the scope of the agreements, constitutions and Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament, too, should respect and not depart from the terminology of the United Nations, the Council and the Commission for the footnote relating to Kosovo.

      <p sl="sv">There are some important things that we found in the report. The most important of all is that we would like to emphasise that we strongly support the enlargement process, not least at a time when less democratic and less European forces are attempting to convince us that Europe is about something other than freedom, peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also important for us to acknowledge that enlargement is good, both for the candidate countries and for Europe. It is a good framework within which we can discuss our political visions and the candidate countries’ fulfilment of the criteria, which is so important for the credibility of the enlargement process.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The new Serbian government, for example, has taken Chapter 23 seriously and has done a very good job with regard to the fight against corruption and organised crime. However, certain elements of the previous government’s structures continue to exert their influence and are making this work more difficult. We must therefore remain alert and render assistance as and when necessary.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Like Mr Kukan, I also think that this report insists a little too much on things like the social dimension and the EU’s integration capacity. I had wished that we could previously have had definite visions for the security aspect of enlargement too.</p>

However, I strongly oppose paragraph 27, which is open to misinterpretation and may be used as a means of casting doubt on the sovereignty of states, with its references to binding arbitration and recourse to international courts for the settlement of cross-border or other disputes. I refer to the case of Cyprus. Although, for us, there is no cross-border territorial dispute with Turkey, and no dispute over our country’s exclusive economic area, Turkey is indisputably causing provocation by illegally occupying Cypriot territory and – with belligerent threats, with battle cries – laying claim to our exclusive marine economic zone. This is not consistent with the behaviour of an country which is a candidate for accession. I consider it my duty to defend the rights of my country and to uphold EU rights and the credibility of the European Union, and I stress that we cannot enter into any arbitration with a country which is acting illegally, and whose foremost pre-accession obligation was and remains the lifting of the military occupation of Cyprus. Turkey must abide by the principles of the European Union and not interrupt the work of the Joint Parliamentary Committee because it supposedly does not recognise the Cyprus Presidency.</p>

This controversial question, as you know, has fuelled long, complex and sometimes heated debates in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. This report, and specifically paragraph 26, settles this question in a realistic, politically sound and clear manner. Outstanding bilateral problems, and particularly those with a bearing on good neighbourly relations between a country that is a candidate for accession and a Member State, must be resolved before the start of accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="el">After all this, there is only one thing to add: I am concerned at the fact that the report mentions the possibility of a new category, that of the associate member state. This is a serious issue which I think we need to look at again.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Commissioner Füle, this is an outstanding report, and in this context it would be good to signal to the candidate countries that the reason why they need to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria (rule of law, human rights, regionalisation, minority rights) and undertake reforms is not because Brussels expects it, but because it is in their own interests. So it is very important to turn things around and warn the candidate states not to follow the recently acceded Member States in the area of economic reform, where the neoliberal model, unbridled capitalism, has sadly been put in place. I have one more comment to make: the European Commission and the European Union can only credibly ask them to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria if the current Member States fulfil them too, including as regards minority …</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, in paragraphs 26, 27 and 28, the report attempts to convert international differences, including questions of military occupation, such as Kosovo and Cyprus, into bilateral disputes under the arbitration of the European Union, which will undertake to resolve them on the basis of the overall interests of the Union, as is expressly stated, and not on the basis of international law. On the pretext of human rights and democracy, the report calls on the European Union to intervene in the political systems of the accession countries by financing – through pre-accession aid – the mechanisms of the bourgeois state, various non-governmental organisations and the labour aristocracy of the trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report expresses the increasingly aggressive and imperialist nature and role of the European Union and calls for a strengthening of this role against peoples and Member States and against the accession countries and, in particular, the peoples of Europe. The only way ahead, therefore, is through disengagement from the EU and through relations of solidarity among the peoples.</p>

There are, however, several accession applications that prove these opinions wrong, like the 2005 and 2007 enlargements. I wonder how the European Union would have weathered the current crisis without enlargement and how it would have responded to global challenges.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We cannot, however, talk about enlargement while using the notion of a European Union associate member, which move further away from the spirit of the founding Treaties.

Knowing the recent history and ethnic relations in the region, the magnitude of this issue is such that current EU’s minority protection provisions – effectively non-existent – are inadequate for addressing the problems. Interethnic relations not only affect stability within a country, but also relations between countries, and between Member States and accession countries. In my opinion, therefore, the enlargement process needs to be seen as a wake-up call to the EU that minority protection provisions need to be put in place within European law so that contentious issues can be resolved on the basis of a single set of regulations applicable to everyone. Member States, too, must adhere to the Copenhagen criteria, since the countries in line for accession …</p>

The larger the European Union becomes, the more important it is that the conditions are fulfilled. Otherwise, if necessary, we may have to think about alternative and interim solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Copenhagen criteria also state that the pace of enlargement must take into account the capacity of the Union to absorb new members. This is not always considered to an adequate extent. During this crisis, it is especially important to consider that over-hasty enlargement without proper fulfilment of the criteria will weaken the European Union. In this crisis in particular, we must make clear that the consolidation of the European Union is a major challenge which we ourselves must address. I believe that the consolidation of the European Union has some element of conditionality for future enlargements as well, for it is directly related to the European Union’s capacity to absorb new members.</p>

    <intervention id="3-394-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been an important debate with important messages. What a perfect time to remind ourselves, our Member States, the Commission and our aspirant candidate countries, firstly, that enlargement has never been a part of the problem! It has always been a part of the solution; secondly, that the European Union has never been about building walls, but about eliminating dividing lines through its values and principles; and thirdly, that there is no more powerful instrument of transformation than enlargement. This is an absolutely unique instrument we have in our hands. We need to use it wisely throughout our neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">That leads me to the important contributions in this debate. I see six of them. The first one is the contribution to the debate of the interaction of the integration process, going deeper and deeper and, at the same time, extending the European Union. What has made this European Union big and strong? Enlargement alone? I doubt it. Going deeper and deeper? I doubt it. It is a combination of the two. Let us not cut off one our arms now because we are facing many problems and say that the time for the enlargement will come. No! It is this interaction between enlargement and deeper integration which is actually making the European Union a stronger union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is in that context, whether we call it an association membership or whatever, that we should have that discussion about a multilayered European Union. Whether we call it political union or a federation of national states, it needs to be an enlargement-friendly Union. At a time when the Member States are debating the various levels of the integration, let us open at some point the issue of to what extent we allow candidate countries – maybe not those which are in the pipeline, but others, to which some of you referred – different ways of being a part of this tremendous European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second message concerns credibility – credibility through the lessons learned and credibility through engagement. We are being creative and we will continue to be creative because it is through that engagement that we are fighting reform fatigue. I am not too concerned about enlargement fatigue. We need to be aware that, if we are not careful enough, enlargement fatigue could turn into reform fatigue and then I would say that we have a problem. Any problem in our neighbourhood is our problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">A third point concerns economic governance. Let us make sure that aspirant and candidate countries are part of our efforts to address the issues of economic governance. Let us make sure that through the accession negotiations we are not addressing only the acquis of the past, but also the acquis of the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">A fourth point concerns adequate financing. As far as I am concerned, it is not necessarily about more money. It is about those resources being spent better and this is definitely one of the issues where I need your support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fifth point concerns bilateral issues. Enlargement is not about importing open bilateral issues into the European Union. We need to make sure that it does not also blow up the accession negotiation. We need to be sure that the unresolved, unaddressed bilateral issues do not create mines which could blow up before our eyes in the framework of the accession process. I am very open to finding ways – including the one of arbitration, turning to The Hague and so on – to address those bilateral issues in parallel to the accession negotiation process. Let us discuss the deadline by which you would like to see all the bilateral issues solved. I would be in favour of that deadline being the signing of the accession treaty because it is that accession process which creates a strong momentum for addressing those issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point: let me finish where I started, with the Nobel Peace Prize. If I think about the Nobel Peace Prize – maybe it is my interpretation, maybe I am wrong – I think this European Union got that prize exactly for its ability to put the deepening of integration and enlargement at the service of its people. Needless to say, I see this Nobel Peace Prize as a strong signal to the European Union at this critical time; a signal not to look over our shoulders, not to look back, but to look forward.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, there are three final points I would like to stress after this extremely interesting debate. Firstly, the need to pay attention to the social dimension of enlargement, an issue which has been ignored for many years. We hope the Commission will place emphasis on social questions, in the context of the evaluation of negotiation chapter 19. It must ensure that the trade unions and civil society participate in the screening and monitoring processes and that they are given targeted support through the pre-accession aid mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, an issue which has been much discussed here is bilateral disputes. Bilateral issues and bilateral disputes are a reality. So I agree with the Commissioner that they must be resolved as soon as possible. The Union does not have the luxury of bringing in outstanding issues, and there must be mechanisms – and here we can all be very constructive – that will contribute to this.</p>
      <p sl="el">The third point is the financial aspect. The Union must have adequate financial resources to meet the level of its steadily increasing ambitions. I therefore do not consider a significant reduction in resources, in the region of 9 %, to be acceptable (in chapter 4, under the next financial framework).</p>
      <p sl="el">To conclude, my fellow Member Kristian Vigenin (rapporteur on IPA-II) and I emphasised the need to simplify the pre-accession aid procedures, and I thank the Commissioner, in particular, for his response on this central issue. With my fellow Members, in the spirit expressed in this discussion, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Füle on his untiring efforts to move the grand plan for enlargement forward. We are at a crucial turning-point, and our decisions and the next steps we take will decide the entire future of this enterprise.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, for candidate countries and potential candidate countries, the process of accession to the European Union represents the path to consolidating the rule of law, respect for fundamental values and the adoption of a social inclusion and protection model. The European Union remains attractive not only due to its economic model, but also its social model. The Union cannot impose merciless austerity measures without losing part of its identity. That is why I am calling for an end to drastic budget cuts and measures to encourage positive social transformation in its future members. The Commission must defend and propagate the European social model, the symbol of the Union and foundation of European aspirations.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In my opinion, the enlargement process is not just something that applies to the countries seeking accession to the European Union. In the process of enlargement there are lessons to be learned that apply to the Member States too. One example is that to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the enlargement strategy, Member States must also adhere to all of the Copenhagen criteria. This can help prevent a situation where candidate countries are expected to meet tougher conditions, for example with regard to protection of national minorities, than some of the Member States. It is important for the EU to monitor countries’ adherence to their commitments post-accession and not just call them to account during the accession negotiations. Traditional national minorities play a major role in the current enlargement package as these communities are present in significant numbers in the candidate countries. Mutual understanding and historical reconciliation are vitally important if these countries are to be able to set out on the road to Europe. For this reason, they need to be taught and to learn about each other’s history, language and cultural heritage. I would like to conclude by underlining that civil society also has a major role to play in the enlargement process, and not only the organs of state. It is therefore vital to encourage greater involvement by non-state actors, notably the social partners, and promote the development of close partnerships and cooperation during the accession process on the part of both the candidate countries and the Member States. After all, none of the actors concerned would be able to resolve the problems on their own.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Over the course of its history, the European Union has managed to steer numerous countries towards democratic consolidation and a market economy. The countries of the Western Balkans, still at war with each other a decade and a half ago, have also embarked on this path. Next year we welcome Croatia as the 28th Member State of the European Union, while the other successor states of former Yugoslavia and Albania are also coming ever closer to accession, albeit at differing speeds. Accession calls for a major effort on the part of candidate countries. It is right and proper that the criteria have been tightened and that the judicial system and fundamental rights have been placed centre-stage in the process. It is important to ensure that civil society and non-state actors also play their part in the ongoing dialogue between Brussels and the capitals of these countries. If we want the European Union to remain an attractive community we must ensure that we do not show disregard for our acquis. I support the clause in the report calling upon the European Commission to work out a detailed proposal for a monitoring mechanism to assess Member States’ continued compliance with the EU’s fundamental values. Only by doing so can the EU’s greatest success so far – enlargement – retain its credibility.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The process for the accession of Turkey to the European Union has already lasted a decade. It will certainly last much longer. But the heart of the matter lies not in the length, but in the integrity of the whole process. Negotiation of the different chapters is a complex technical and political problem, particularly in view of the situation in Cyprus. It is quite clear that this situation can only be remedied through joint efforts, for there are failings on the EU side too, mainly in the imprudent acceptance of just one part of Cyprus as a member of the EU. Turkey too must show good will. This definitely applies for the observance of fundamental human rights, which is certainly not perfect, but Turkey has made great strides in the last decade. Also, by accepting Turkey, the EU would encourage that country to play a positive role in the democratisation of north Africa. Turkey represents a model, to which most Arab countries aspire, while turning their back on Iran. A greater contribution to the fight against the threat of terrorism can hardly be imagined. Fellow Members, it is in this context that we must look again at Turkish membership of the EU without any prejudices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, we are now in the eighth day of the current conflict in Gaza and Israel. I am sure you followed developments last night as closely as I did and with the same hope that a ceasefire would be attained. Regrettably our hopes proved to be premature. While I understand there were indeed intensive negotiations on a possible ceasefire, to come into effect at midnight last night local time, the announcement of such a truce was postponed. Negotiations have continued today – it is vital that they succeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United Nations Security Council met last night to discuss developments and will resume discussions later today in New York if need be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the day I have also been receiving reports of a terrorist attack on a bus in Tel Aviv. This has to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I wish a speedy recovery to those injured. The European Union reiterates its strong and unequivocal condemnation of all forms and acts of terrorism – irrespective of their origin, cause or motive – and its unwavering commitment to the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation on the ground is very volatile and attacks continue in both Israel and Gaza. We reiterate our call for an urgent de-escalation and cessation of hostilities. The diplomatic focus is now on a ceasefire as a stepping stone to a longer-lasting solution. In order to achieve this, the High Representative/Vice-President is in continuing close contact with key players in the region and elsewhere. During the last few days she has been reaching out in particular to Egypt, the US, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the UN and the Arab League. She co-chaired the EU/League of Arab States ministerial meeting in Cairo, where she was able to speak to key players including Egyptian President Morsi and Arab League Secretary-General Elaraby. She has remained in constant touch throughout.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you will have seen, on Monday 19 November the Foreign Affairs Council agreed conclusions on the violence in Gaza and Israel and on efforts to achieve a ceasefire.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union calls for a ceasefire and an immediate de-escalation, given the continuing violence over the last few days and mounting civilian losses. The EU has strongly condemned the rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, which Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza must cease immediately. We have also stressed the need for all sides fully to respect international humanitarian law. Protection of civilians should be strictly ensured at all times. By recalling the EU’s overall position on the Gaza blockade, this text represents a balanced consensus but also reflects clear and strong EU positions on the current situation and demonstrates a unity of purpose in the present crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Gaza has placed Egypt at the heart of international efforts to bring about a solution to the crisis. On Monday, the EU stated its support for the efforts by Egypt and others to achieve a rapid ceasefire. It also welcomed the mission of the UN Secretary-General to the region and supported him in his efforts to bring about peace. The EU now stands ready to do what it can to encourage all sides to ensure the implementation of a ceasefire.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, a ceasefire is in the interests of both sides, and not least of the civilian population, which has already taken a heavy toll over the past few days, enduring both physical and psychological trauma. The loss of civilian lives on both sides has been tragic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The humanitarian situation, already precarious in Gaza, has inevitably taken a turn for the worse, but humanitarian support is still available. The vital border crossing for goods at Kerem Shalom has remained open throughout the hostilities. For the time being, food is not in short supply. The World Food Programme continues its food distribution activities. Gaza’s limited power supply has not been seriously affected but clean water and drugs are in short supply.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU will continue to play a leading role on the humanitarian front and already dedicates a considerable proportion of its Palestinian assistance programme to the Gaza Strip. This includes not only our support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees – the majority of the Gaza population being Palestinian refugees – but also direct financial assistance to support vulnerable Palestinian families. The EU is also providing support to sustain vital social services, including in the health sector, and is engaged in upgrading the Palestinian side of the key Gaza-Israel crossing at Kerem Shalom, through which so much of the support on which Gaza depends must pass.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU stands ready to reactivate the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) at Rafah, once political and security conditions allow, to ensure its third-party role at the crossing point there, as set out in the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fully recognising Israel’s legitimate security needs, the EU continues to call for a complete stop to all arms smuggling into Gaza. At the same time, it also continues to call for the immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from the Gaza Strip. Gaza’s position remains unsustainable for as long as it continues to be politically separated from the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU reiterates its readiness to assist in the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza, in close partnership with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1860.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, the recent upsurge of violence in Gaza and Israel, against the background of a seismic shift in the political landscape of the Middle East and North Africa, shows how fragile the region continues to be. Moving towards resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would help to stabilise the entire region and would reward those who are committed to non-violence. The EU has a strong interest in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations for statehood and Israel’s aspirations for security, including against regional threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">A ceasefire, if properly implemented, would help but would not be sufficient. The need to find a sustainable solution for Gaza is more urgent than ever – a long-term solution which will not lead to yet another round of violence. To that end, and as soon as is practicable, the EU will intensify its contacts with its partners within the Quartet, and with other key players, to explore all possibilities for creating a new dynamic in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I have just been informed that Egypt confirms an agreement on a ceasefire. We will seek confirmation of this information but I wanted to let you know without delay about this development.</p>

      <p sl="es">We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome your announcement, President-in-Office of the Council, of a ceasefire, which must be consolidated. Too many civilians have died, too many children have died and too much blood has been shed in that region, so it is a real relief to hear that. However, as well as consolidating the ceasefire, we also have to support President Abbas’s legitimate request to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, Operation Pillar of Defence resembled 2008’s nightmare operation, Operation Cast Lead: they were both close to Israeli elections and there was the same escalation of violence, which on the Israeli side meant extrajudicial killings and attacks, and on the Gaza side, missiles and rockets being fired at Israel and perhaps even an attack in Tel Aviv today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This time, however, something was different. Two things were different, in fact: on the one hand, the Arab Spring changed the goalposts and Gaza is no longer isolated, and on the other hand, there is also Operation Pillar of Defence, which to some extent was part of pressure on Mahmoud Abbas to refrain from putting his request to the UN.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Egypt acted as mediator with Gaza. I think that it is really up to us in Europe to face up to our responsibilities and support President Abbas. Our concern for Israel’s security, which is a genuine concern, is on a par with our responsibility to offer the Palestinians secure state, too, with the same borders as it had in 1967. These obligations are moral and historical and are based on international law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would point out that South Sudan became a member of the UN three days after gaining independence, even though its borders were not defined and it was still at war with Sudan. It is not right that, since 1988, when it gained its independence, Palestine has been floundering in the corridors of the UN.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we are providing some food for thought for all extremists, all those who ridicule Europe for its weakness, all those who only believe in a solution by force. It is up to us, not the United States. It is our European history; we cannot ask the Palestinians to pay the price for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that the new Egypt, with which we have just negotiated ambitious agreements, is now helping us to resolve this crisis. I would like to send my condolences to the families of all of the victims, on both sides, but I believe that they should not have had to pay for our history and our responsibilities with their lives.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, it is more than 10 years since Nabil Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, spoke to me in the corridor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels and said: ‘We are drowning in the blood of our children’. That was more than 10 years ago and the violence has really never stopped since then. The most recent episode has again been particularly bloody. At the end of the day, knowing who started it hardly matters, because if you go back far enough, there is always someone else who started it and you have that diabolical chain of actions and reactions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So I hope from the bottom of my heart, and I am sure that my group shares this feeling, that a ceasefire has indeed been agreed, in part thanks to the efforts made by Egypt and all other parties who have contributed, and that the cease-fire will be sustained. I also warmly concur with all those who have pointed out that we must help to remove the causes of the violence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That will only become possible when both Israel’s continued existence in peace and freedom and the development of a viable Palestinian state are guaranteed. I hope that the changes in the entire region and the events of recent days will make everyone realise that the status quo is untenable, that the status quo cannot be sustained, and that every effort must be made to seek a peaceful solution for the future of both all Israelis and all Palestinians.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think it is time for some simple truths.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The simple truth is that bombarding Israel with rockets or carrying out attacks in Tel Aviv is not the way to achieve a Palestinian State. Continuing to build settlements and refusing to give Palestinians any prospects for the future is not the way to ensure the security of the State of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that this Parliament must face up to its responsibilities: it must demonstrate, state and support the strategies that could bring peace. Those strategies are clear. We need an unreserved yes to the reality of the State of Israel and the defence of the State of Israel. We need an unreserved yes to the State of Palestine, that is, a Palestinian State that is not restricted by settlements. That means today that we need to support President Abbas’s non-violent strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we do not support this, we will be automatically supporting those who do not want peace. That is why I am very pleased that the EP resolution that we are going to vote on tomorrow states explicitly that we support President Abbas’s strategy of requesting the UN to recognise the State of Palestinian as a non-member observer. If we do not support this, if we do not call for an end to the Gaza blockade under international control, we will not achieve peace in the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not possible to imprison 1.5 million Palestinians and believe that they will continue to be rational. Yes, what the Islamic Jihad does is awful. Yes, firing rockets at Israel is awful. Yes, this has to stop, but it will only stop if these human beings in Gaza have the prospect of a better life. That is very easy to understand and that is why we say yes to Israel’s security, yes to Israel’s identity and yes to Palestine. We must stop the blockade and support President Abbas in the UN.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Perhaps, therefore, it would be wise – on your part, too – to try to understand that an end to the blockade today with international control of what enters – we would allow food and material to rebuild Gaza and control the rest – would in fact enable us to control the underground tunnels as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As long as there is no international control, no extensive international control, but food and building materials are getting in, you will have the tunnels to allow rockets to get in, and you will have the situation that you have today, with a population that is becoming increasingly desperate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent hostilities between Hamas and Israel over the last week are an avoidable human tragedy. They came about from the escalation of Gaza-launched rocket attacks, including longer-range Iranian ones, on Israel, with indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas, resulting in five civilian deaths in Israel and damage to infrastructure. Every state has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, so Israel is fully entitled to seek out all legitimate military targets, including rocket launch sites and ammunition dumps, which it has done on a surgical basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hamas disgracefully sited its launchers in densely populated civilian areas, which make it guilty of another war crime by putting its civilian population at risk of Israeli bombardment. The ECR Group of course supports a two-state solution based on a viable Palestinian state which includes both Gaza and the West Bank living in peace and security with Israel. However, there can be no prospects of such when Gaza is run by an EU-banned terrorist organisation wishing to destroy the state of Israel. Of course we also wish to see negotiations for a Palestinian State to restart and we support the moderate leadership of President Abbas. However, I am not convinced by the calls within the resolution for UN observer state status for the Palestinians, as this would undermine the restarting of the peace negotiations. Nor am I convinced by the desire to lift the blockade, as I doubt very much, Mr Zala, that political guarantees or international mechanisms can ensure that there will be no maritime smuggling of arms to Gaza, particularly from Iran by ship.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, my sympathies go out to the victims of today’s bomb attack in Tel Aviv in which 10 people were injured, making the calls led by Egypt for an immediate ceasefire extremely difficult, but I do hope the announcement made by the Foreign Minister of Cyprus will hold and there will be an immediate ceasefire.</p>

Do you not know that this immediate upturn in the conflict has come about after the killing of a 12-year-old boy who was playing soccer in Gaza?

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, a comment before I start: this debate has the title ‘Situation in Gaza’. More faithful to the facts, more balanced, however, would be the title ‘Situation in Israel and Gaza’. This is because it was the rain of Hamas rockets and related jihadist terror groups on Israeli soil that led to this most recent violent outbreak in the Gaza conflict. The entirely legitimate defence of Israeli citizens’ lives and property was and is at issue. Add to that admiration for the disproportionate resilience on the Israeli side before this escalation: two indispensable elements for Parliament’s resolution in my opinion. In these darker days I pray for real peace in Jerusalem, for both Jews and Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore expect all the European institutions to adopt a responsible position in the long drawn-out Gaza conflict. The main point is that our position must be to fundamentally oppose all forces in the Middle East that deny Israel’s right to exist and threaten Israel to this day. A forceful European message is especially desirable today for Hamas’s protectors, Egypt first of all, Qatar and Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in these painful, tragic times, it is absolutely essential to ensure that the force of politics replaces the violence of the politics of force. From that point of view, Parliament must adopt a clear, strong resolution to support the ceasefire – if there is one – and encourage a lasting peace and a two-state solution. However, I think that it is not possible to justify this escalation by constantly putting the two sides on the same footing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this matter, there is a party that is doing the colonising and there is a party that is being colonised. In this matter, there are the people of Gaza who are being blockaded, and the other side that is dominating them. The truth is that by calling Hamas the enemy and the representative, we have undermined the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which decided 20 years ago to abandon their armed struggle and participate in a process of dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The international community and the European Union have undermined, and even humiliated, the Palestinian Authority and allowed Israel to act with complete impunity. Not a single political initiative has ever been taken to ensure respect for international law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what fuels the radical fundamentalist groups, which, now and always, justify this unacceptable policy of blockade, of colonisation and of war. The truth is that, like four years ago, the Israeli authorities are today using fear, triggering a war and causing bloodshed among the Palestinians just to gain votes in an election campaign. The truth is that this warmongering aims to prevent Palestine from becoming a United Nations observer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to be clear now and help to ensure that international law is respected. We can do this through Article 2 of the Association Agreements and by expressly supporting Mahmoud Abbas’s request for Palestine to be given observer status.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is no more apt appeal than that of Michal Wasser, an Israeli teacher who lives three kilometres from Gaza and who wrote a letter to the Israeli Prime Minister that was published in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. I will read from it: ‘If you are worried about us, stop defending us with missiles. Instead of Operation Pillar of Defence, launch Operation Hope for the Future’. I use those words because I could not say it better myself.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I am right now in a position to confirm that a ceasefire has been agreed. It was announced by the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mohamed Amr, and the Secretary of State of the United States, Hilary Clinton, at a press conference just a few minutes ago. The ceasefire will start at 19.00 hours GMT.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, by holding a debate on developments in Gaza the European Parliament has shown once again its overriding concern for the civilian population in the region and its constant support for lasting pace in the Middle East. With 130 people killed in Gaza and five in Israel up to last night, many of them women and children, and more deaths in Gaza today, we owe it to the ordinary people caught up in this conflict to make every effort to consolidate the ceasefire reached and find an enduring solution which addresses Gaza’s isolation. Journalists have also been among the casualties and I repeat my call to Israel to ensure the protection of civilians at all times.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also deplore the summary executions of seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over the last two days by armed groups there. This represents the grossest violation of human rights. Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation remains a key element for any durable solution. It is important to bear in mind that the situation in Gaza has also led to an increase in tensions in the West Bank, with two deaths confirmed after the use of live Israeli ammunition in the West Bank protests on 18 and 19 November. Palestinian unity is an important element for a viable Palestinian state and essential for ensuring lasting peace with Israel. The European Union has consistently called for a Palestinian reconciliation under the authority of President Abbas and has commended Egypt’s earlier efforts to bring this about since the signing of the reconciliation agreement in May 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">A negotiated two-state solution which we have always called for continues to be the only viable option open to both Israel and the Palestinian people. Escalations of violence of the type we have witnessed these last few days are a tragic distraction from this hard-nosed reality.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to begin by welcoming the truce between Hamas and Israel mediated by Egypt. There are, however, many aspects that we cannot overlook. Israel has been the target of missiles fired from Gaza for many years. A total of 1 100 rockets have been fired into Israel since 10 November and over 900 since the beginning of Operation Pillar of Defence. A further bomb attack took place in Tel Aviv despite intense diplomatic efforts. Few governments would tolerate a situation in which civilians are deliberately targeted. We are also faced with an unbalanced situation, whereby the Israeli army is forced to respect the rules of armed conflict whereas its enemy – the armed group Hamas – is not.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, Europe was again absent from the conflict mediation efforts. If we want a long-term solution, Europe must make its voice heard. We must, therefore, resolve the recurring missile issue in the Gaza Strip and ensure that international humanitarian laws remain at the centre of the peace process. Finally, I do not believe that the reference in paragraph 5 of our joint resolution to granting Palestine observer status in the UN is appropriate in this context.</p>

      <p sl="it">The conflict between Israel and Hamas and other terrorist factions operating in Gaza is asymmetric. On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people. It is unrealistic to believe that peace can be achieved with Hamas.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to list today all of the crises and threats that affect our security and the stability of our continent and its neighbours. Every day – as we have just heard – we hear new reasons that lead us to believe that this multipolar world at the start of the 21st century is in many regards more dangerous than the world we had become used to because it is less predictable and less organised: civil war in Syria, Israeli-Arab tensions, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, clashes and crime in the Sahel, piracy off the coast of Somalia and continued fighting in Congo, to list just today’s dangers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to think of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as a luxury or a bit of an aside. It is a policy that is undoubtedly recent and still being formed. More than any other policy at EU level, it is a policy that is based on the Member States, on their material and human capacities, on their traditions and on their political desire to share, or not, as the case may be, their almost absolute sovereignty in diplomatic and military matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This leads too many observers – and too many Members here – to believe that the CSDP is negligible or a pointless illusion. On the contrary, we believe – without any naivety or excess illusions – that the CSDP is a strategic necessity for the European Union. That is also why it appears in full in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union simply cannot continue just to systematically delegate its security and that of its neighbours. Of course, NATO, which brings together 21 of the 27 Member States, is still the cornerstone of the continent’s common defence, and we should be pleased about that. In addition, we must reaffirm the transatlantic partnership, which is irreplaceable, but it does not exclude efforts and ambitions on the part of the European countries themselves; on the contrary. Indeed, the United States, which has begun a real strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific is calling on us in Europe to be more active, more robust, more sure of ourselves when it comes to security and defence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those who call into question the CSDP and say that it duplicates work must realise that it offers pragmatic and intelligent complementarity when it comes to NATO, a military organisation, and the European Union. There are some crises that affect our security and in which NATO cannot intervene; Georgia was one example, and the same applies generally to the African conflicts, where the United States does not feel obliged to intervene, as we saw with the recent example of Libya. Unfortunately, these examples could increase in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Action by the European Union is often completely legitimate because its actions comply fully with international law, and there are few third countries that do not acknowledge its balanced role without any ambiguous, unilateral ambitions. It has many ways to act; it has the excellent civilian/military global approach and it is the only body to have this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All too often, unfortunately, what we are missing is political will – above all, on the part of the Member States: a lack of political will – and we have to emphasise this, too – or motivation on the part of certain Brussels institutions that are in charge of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the CSDP, a lack of vision at times, a reluctance to act in the Council, an ideological reluctance because we believe that soft power is more effective that the use of an armed force, and an absence of clear priorities that, too often, give the impression that we are making it up as we go along.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The strategic challenges that we face are enormous and unprecedented: a structural and sustainable reduction in the defence budgets of European countries, the reorientation of US priorities, volatility and an extremely diverse range of threats. Therefore, the Member States either have to undergo a major and collective strategic downgrade, or pick themselves up and exploit as best they can, the potential of the CSDP, modest as it still may be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is no doubt that most of our efforts today should focus on capacity-building, and in this regard we emphasise in the report the virtues of the pooling and sharing initiative promoted by the European Defence Agency, which is a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The economic and strategic crises must not be used as an excuse – and this is important, Mr President – to turn our backs, but should instead be an opportunity to strengthen our common ambition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure, nor so free. Words written in the European Security Strategy of 2003 are questionable today, confronted with increasingly complex risks and threats moving closer and closer to home. To those, we answer with a rush to slash our defence budgets, making life miserable for the defence planners, be they from NATO or the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, NATO, responsible for the security of 21 of the 27 EU Member States, is confronted with the American reorientation towards Asia, forcing Europe to manage the consequences through increasing their contribution to NATO and strengthening the EU security and defence dimension.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is a step in that latter direction. To that effect, under the existing legal reality, the report does not ask for new instruments or new powers for the EU but argues for a more coherent and efficient interaction of the existing instruments, pointing to what the Union should do in case either one or both clauses are invoked, apart from and until the national mechanisms are activated. This way, the EU mechanisms do not substitute for the national ones. They only support and amend them, helping the Member States to deal successfully with a situation invoking the clauses.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, the report is about solidarity. Any member of the EU, including those not in NATO, is entitled to respect from their organisation because solidarity is indispensable to the cohesion of the EU, acting as a deterrent of aggression too; particularly at a time when, due to the current crisis, centrifugal forces are getting stronger.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although in practice the two clauses, mutual defence and solidarity, could be interconnected, the report takes them separately for reasons of clarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">What the report names the mutual defence clause – because in the Treaty on European Union it is nameless – although it deals with measures in case of external armed aggression is a provision imported from the Treaty of Brussels establishing the Western European Union, which after Lisbon has been embedded into the EU’s legal basis. On the other hand, the solidarity clause is an addition following the multiplication of natural and man-made disasters both within and outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Article 42(7) states that the EU NATO members rely for their security on the North Atlantic Treaty, the report underlines the importance of the relationship between the EU and NATO which should be seen as cooperative and not competitive, being instead organisations complementary to one another. To that effect, the report advocates the cohesion of the EU’s pooling and sharing and NATO’s smart defence initiatives; the creation in time of an EU headquarters; and defining today’s risks and threats in a modern way, adapted to reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">In turn, the solidarity clause is meant to address the situations where the national capacities of a state to deal with a certain disaster are overwhelmed, to maintain a balance between preparedness and flexibility and to avoid the phenomenon of free riding when one prefers to rely more on others than on oneself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report, arguing for the best use of such instruments like the civil protection mechanism, the internal security strategy and the capacities of the External Action Service, supports the ongoing review of the emergency and crisis coordination arrangement and the development of an integrated situational awareness.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the report asks the High Representative to propose practical arrangements and guidelines for ensuring a rapid and coherent response in the event of a Member State invoking the mutual defence clause.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also call on the Commission and the High Representative before the end of 2012 to make the joint proposal for a Council Decision, defining the arrangements for the implementation of the solidarity clause, clarifying in particular the roles and competences of different actors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is to be seen as a first comprehensive message from the European Parliament to address both cyber security and cyber defence. Since the first politically motivated cyber attacks against the state in 2007, cyber challenges and attacks have been growing at a dramatic pace and constitute a serious threat to security, stability and also to the competitiveness of different societies. The have the potential to do genuine damage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cyber threats and attacks have become a constant, let us say, collateral element of our everyday lives. There is still no internationally agreed model on how to respond to state-backed cyber attacks against a Member State. The report therefore urges the Commission, and especially the High Representative, to consider implementation of Article 222, the solidarity clause, or in the absence of common terminology, at least a mutual defence clause, in the case of a serious cyber attack against a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our main message to the Commission is to come forward with a comprehensive EU cyber security strategy providing a common definition of cyber security and defence, as well as a common operating vision to enhance horizontal cooperation and coordination of cyber security and to create synergies at the EU levels. There are signals that the Commission is in the course of preparations and I hope that today’s report will encourage the Commission to complete its preparations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cyber security policies should not be implemented at the expense of digital freedoms which are in fact a prerequisite for fully enjoying human rights. Therefore, we call for caution while applying restrictions on citizens’ free use of cyber space, which has two billion globally connected users. It is a powerful instrument for mediating freedom and also fighting dictatorships.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we realise that security and defence problems ultimately have to be addressed by the national governments. What do we see? We see dramatically different levels of preparedness among Member States. Only ten Member States have completed their national cyber security defence strategies, while 17 are still expected follow suit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some important points were made in this report. We need a coordinated assessment of cyber attacks on the EU level. We call on all EU institutions to include in their risk analysis and crisis management plans the issue of cyber crisis management. And there is a call for a back to basics. Cyber security depends not only on modern technology, but starts with elementary cyber hygiene. The great majority of cyber attacks can be prevented by providing citizens as well as civil servants with adequate education. It is high time to introduce cyber security in education, in school curricula, from the earliest possible age. Private-public cooperation is a key factor. The private sector is an important actor and we call for creation of frameworks and instruments for a rapid information change system that could guarantee anonymity of private firms when reporting cyber attacks.</p>

    <intervention id="3-432-000" speaker_id="97136" name="Indrek Tarand" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a rapporteur I have discovered huge resources in the results of the work of previous European generations in the same area and topic, namely CSDP and climate change. One is of the utmost necessity during times of a globally changing security environment and the other is around and happening every day. Hence we must live with that and cope with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I believe our debate is very timely. It comes after Hurricane Sandy but, more importantly, it comes simultaneously with a non-paper by the Cyprus Presidency on the need to develop the military capacity of the EU, which aims to have a decision made by the Council during the year 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">We began the work on this report by convening a meeting of different stakeholders – with External Action Service staff, with the Commission DGs CLIMA, ECHO and DEVCO, EU military staff, the EDA and people from various other institutions. I learned a lot from those people. May I use the opportunity to thank them for their help and guidance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Besides that, I pushed two other issues. Firstly, to appoint an EU climate security envoy within the External Action Service, following the British Government’s example – Admiral Neil Morisetti has been very successfully working for three years in this function. We also believe that this could support the German Government initiative to give an impulse to a similar function with the United Nations system. Secondly, another idea was to use the generally acknowledged perception that climate change is a threat multiplier and to use it as a platform to introduce more cooperation between Member States and the respective military in particular, up to forming a joint engineering corps for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups worked hard and many succeeded in convincing their political groups to support these ideas, whereas others disagreed and gave substantial reasons for their objections. We ended up with 17 compromises out of 150 amendments. I would like to thank all the shadows for their contributions, which made the report clearer and better, sometimes less ambitious but at the same time more pragmatic and closer to the democratic consensus which we cherish in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, thank you. I have learned a lot from you. To give just one example, Mr Van Orden asked me to be specific on the engineering corps and I was in some difficulty. Only later I discovered that this might have happened because I am only a former Soviet sergeant, but he has the experience of a brigadier. So we will have to cooperate on that in the future as we were able agree on his other concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to quickly highlight the three important points in this report where we achieved consensus. The Lisbon Treaty creates new provisions for implementing CSDP activities. That is why this report also describes tools which could be used, for example, in policy planning, with a coherent and logical approach to defence adapted to security challenges that we in Europe will have to face in decades to come. Also the mainstreaming of potential effects of climate on security into the most important strategies, policy documents and financial instruments, would be a success in my opinion. In the External Action Service it could also be done in the same way as the recently appointed Special Representative on Human Rights. That could also work with climate and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say a couple of words about duplication. We have been accused, regarding the role of the CSDP in climate-driven security threats, of duplicating the excellent work that has been done by Commissioner Georgieva and her people in the field of the Civil Protection Mechanism. We had a meeting with Commissioner Georgieva, who, as a former professor and author of many books on environmental economics, had no difficulty at all in seeing that this report is complementary to her achievements. I would like to thank her for her participation in making this report. I am excited that today’s debate is taking place and look forward to hearing every comment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am honoured to speak to you today in accordance with the Treaty on the Common and Security and Defence Policy on behalf of the High Representative. The four parliamentary reports we are discussing are timely and relevant; they reflect the world we live in, where an action in a far corner of the world could have an impact in our home town.</p>
      <p sl="en">They demonstrate that our security is interconnected in various ways. Hence I would like to express my appreciation for the amount of work which lies behind these four reports and for their quality. Your suggestions and recommendations are important to us and we are happy to have Parliament on our side as our partner but also as a fair critic. With three new missions on the ground in the Sahel, South Sudan and Horn of Africa and with two more under preparation, for Mali and Libya, we have seen some dynamic developments over the past year. We have also seen clear results from our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa has shrunk significantly. There have only been five successful attacks this year compared to 25 last year and 47 in 2010. Security inside Somalia has also improved and the government has now extended its power over a great part of its territory previously ruled by Al-Shabaab. EUTM Somalia played an important role in this positive development as 3000 Somali soldiers will be trained by the end of this year and they are taking up their responsibility for Somalia’s security.</p>
      <p sl="en">But despite these tangible results we must not become complacent. The High Representative has said this on numerous occasions and it is worth repeating: we must continue to resource our missions and operations properly and we must continue working towards the goals we have set out for our ongoing missions and our operations. The people that we send into the field are doing a tremendous job often in very dangerous and difficult environments. We are very grateful for their work and for their dedication. Our missions are effective and their results are sustainable only if they are part of a comprehensive approach. The example of the Horn of Africa is a good illustration of our approach. In the Horn, we employ policies and instruments in a consistent and mutually reinforcing manner. In addition to the three CSP operations and on the basis of a jointly agreed strategic framework for the region, there is strong political engagement, support for AMISOM through the African Peace Facility, development cooperation and humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also work very closely with a variety of partners, which increases our impact and also leads to a better use of our resources. The comprehensive approach is about defining a correct policy mix and the proper sequencing of instruments, both at EU level and with Member States. It is about overall consistency in our external relations, about bringing security to populations affected by conflict and alleviating poverty. As we are stepping up operational engagement in new crisis areas such as the Sahel, we must continue working in a comprehensive manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to capabilities. The CSDP allows the European Union to act, but to act we must have capabilities. Member States provide these capabilities and we all know that the financial crisis is putting a heavy burden on national budgets. Defence capabilities are particularly affected. This is why our work on pooling and sharing is so important. Synergies with wider European policies, research and development, dual use and the defence industry are also crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">These themes are prominent in the report by Mr Danjean. Both topics were on the agenda of the Council of Ministers of Defence on 19 November 2012 and Member States are taking a great interest. You are all aware that the President of the European Council has decided to put defence on the agenda of the European Council at the end of December 2013. This offers a very good opportunity to address these challenges at the highest political level.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some common themes in the four reports: the need for comprehensiveness, close coordination in-house, but also with partners, full use of the post-Lisbon set up, better use of resources and the efficiency of our efforts. Indeed, in these trying economic times, these cannot be stressed enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cyber security is a case in point. The report by Mr Kelam sets out the imminent need for stepping up EU-wide preventive measures and to improve horizontal cooperation within the EU institutions and agencies. We also need to bolster public-private partnerships in cyber security. The European External Action Service and the Commission are preparing a joint Commission-EEAS communication on EU cyber security to ensure the adequate level of cyber security preparedness, also looking at cyber defence capabilities and training, as well as a coherent international cyber policy for the European Union. We have already started active international cyber security cooperation, with an emphasis on the United States and on emerging markets as well as NATO, the United Nations, OECD, OSCE and other international organisations. They need to enhance collective knowledge of climate-related security challenges, as set out in the report by Mr Tarand. Indeed, it is necessary to pursue efforts at EU and Member State level, as well as in dialogue with external partners and civil society to identify climate security needs and to further strengthen our understanding of interlinkages between climate change development, environmental degradation, natural resources, migration or conflict. The challenge is to enhance early warning and move to early preventive action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union and Member States are leading international efforts to enhance climate security by initiating policy dialogue, including at the UN Security Council level and in its bilateral relations and by supporting concrete initiatives in the fields of climate risk management and adaptation. One example is the Global Climate Change Alliance, which has a strong focus on climate adaptation in the most climate vulnerable regions of the world. Another area of work relates to the solidarity clause, which is designed for situations of major emergencies affecting the Member States. The European External Action Service and the Commission are currently working on a joint proposal to implement the clause.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report presented by Mr Paşcu is again very timely. We concur with the main lines of the report. I would like to underline some points which seem particularly important to us. As far as structures and procedures are concerned, the EU needs to possess crisis response structures with 24/7 monitoring and response capacity, able to provide early warning and up-to-date situation awareness to all relevant actors on all types of hazards and crises or disasters. The European Union situation room and the Commission’s monitoring and information centre are ready to support the process. Also revised EU emergency and crisis coordination arrangements are suitable in this context. Responding at EU political level in a coherent, efficient and timely way to crises of such a scale and nature requires one single set of arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The four reports at hand today, on a variety of topics, all relate to European security, both internal and external. We look forward to continuing our work with you in our joint efforts to protect the security of our citizens and make the European Union an increasingly effective contributor to global peace and security. I am really looking forward to the forthcoming debate and to your comments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the constitutional features of these reports are two-fold: firstly, just how do we make core groups, clusters and reinforced cooperation work? – we still have not really mastered that – and, secondly, the treaty-based linkages between the Union and NATO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, just on that second point, the technical cooperation appears to be quite good but we all know that political collaboration is extremely poor or weak. We all know why; it is the old intractable problem of Turkey and Cyprus. So, I think if there is anything that we are able to do to breathe real life into the CSDP, it is to resolve the Cyprus problem as soon as we can.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it is significant that today, in a time of crisis, the European Parliament is sending a strong message of European solidarity and is proving its will and its determination that the solution to today’s problems can be achieved only through policies with a truly pan-European dimension.</p>
      <p sl="el">The creation of an integrated Common Security and Defence Policy in Europe has been a vision for decades in the history of European integration. The introduction, in the Treaty of Lisbon, of the two innovative clauses which had been proposed at the European Convention on the Future of Europe is a move precisely in this direction. The final text of the report by Mr Paşcu – whom I would like to congratulate on his work and warmly thank for the cooperation we have had throughout this period – sets out, in a realistic but at the same time ambitious way, specific requirements and guidelines on the measures for enforcing the mutual defence and solidarity clause.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the process, different viewpoints were very clearly expressed on the character and nature of the two innovative clauses. However, the objections concerning the high cost of the whole enterprise, the possible problems and the question of responsibilities falling under NATO’s jurisdiction are an expression of the fears of certain Member States rather than the reality. The truth is that the progressive building of a genuinely Common Security and Defence Policy could drastically reduce the heavy cost of European defence without in the least compromising the NATO commitments which have been entered into.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Vice-President of the Commission and the High Representative should now, before the end of 2012, submit the joint proposal for a Council decision laying down the provisions for the two clauses. Parliament therefore awaits that proposal.</p>

The Union must secure the necessary means and capabilities that will allow it to develop its strategic independence and its ability to provide security for its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the context of the current economic crisis, wider cooperation and common actions at European level are essential and operationally useful. However, these must also allow the release of funds at national level, which can be used in crucial sectors of society.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wish to concentrate my remarks particularly on the Tarand report that we have debated in this House. I congratulate Mr Tarand on the work that he has done.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue of climate change has been overshadowed in public debate by other security concerns, especially in North Africa. But there have been three reports this week: the World Bank’s estimate of a 4° temperature rise by the end of the century, the United Nations saying action to curb emissions is falling short of what is needed and the European Environment Agency reporting that the effects of climate change are already being felt here in Europe, as I have seen in my constituency in South-West England in the last day or two.</p>
      <p sl="de">Climate change is not only adding to the costs of government, it is aggravating the threats to peace and security as the greater impact of climate change beyond our borders causes war about water and adds to the number of climate refugees.</p>
      <p sl="de">This has been acknowledged by High Representative Solana some five years ago, by our foreign ministers last year and again by the Council Presidency today, yet no action has been forthcoming. I call on the Council to reinvigorate the informal Steering Group on Climate Change and to establish a climate envoy because, without that, very little will happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I join in the congratulations for the two defence reports. Both reports reflect some of the difficulties and unclear aspects of the European Common Security and Defence Policy. Therefore I strongly underline the need to define the roles and competences of the different actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danjean report talks about strategic autonomy and strategic decline, which the report assigns to the lack of funds and the reduced defence budgets. The Greens see these more as a result of lack of cooperation, sometimes mismanagement and even a result of wrong priorities. The Paşcu report talks about the mutual defence clause, and mutual assistance clause. At the same time it is very difficult, and I understand the difficulty, to relate these to the NATO defence clause, and in particular for those six EU Member States which remain outside NATO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is the question of the nuclear umbrella, nuclear weapons. As we know, NATO is a nuclear alliance. What is the role for British and French nukes in the context of European defence?</p>
      <p sl="en">The management and decision-making structures and procedures for the so-called defence clause are very clear and I hope that the appeal for the High Representative to clarify these issues will be taken seriously.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have a simple question to the Council and the Commission: why does the European Union not concentrate its crisis-management efforts on the civil and humanitarian contributions that it makes, instead of trying to play soldiers? By doing less, better, the EU might have a chance of actually getting something right.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, European countries must do more militarily: they are NATO allies. But we do not need the EU to be involved to bring that about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have the greatest respect for my friend Mr Danjean, but his Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) report is just another chapter in the litany of European integration: little to do with practical capability and all about ‘lending political credibility and visibility to the Union’s actions while also allowing political control’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I come back to my point about getting the civil side right. Even a CSDP enthusiast such as Mr Danjean wonders why the European Union Aviation Security Mission (EUAVSEC) to improve airport security at Juba in South Sudan is categorised as a CSDP mission rather than a straightforward Commission project under the instrument for stability. The same might be said of 10 out of the 13 other so-called CSDP missions which are purely civilian in nature. I go further: the police training mission in Afghanistan has been a catalogue of errors. The EUR 500 million EULEX mission in Kosovo, according to the European Court of Auditors, has achieved more or less nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Few of the EU’s costly and distracting CSDP missions stand up to critical scrutiny. May I just say that I hope other Prime Ministers will support the British Prime Minister tomorrow when he calls for cuts in the EU budget. While some CSDP action is useful, the EU’s External Action Service and its wasteful foreign forays offer immediate scope for savings.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. − Mr President, if I could enquire of Mr Van Orden, I read the Court of Auditors’ report on EULEX, exposing the fact that it was poorly resourced and poorly sustained by Member States as being the true cause of its relative – and I stress the word relative – lack of success so far.

That seems to be the consequence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we are talking about getting it right. This is my very point. If the European Union actually focused its efforts on these civil missions, to try and get them properly organised and effectively administered, then we might be getting somewhere.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and I would not wish to question its achievements, such as its role in reconciliation after the Second World War. However, the reports before us speak a different language. The mutual defence clause, in effect, turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause includes the option of military intervention in Member States in response to man-made disasters.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me ask the House this: would a Europe-wide general strike constitute such a man-made disaster? Will soldiers from Germany soon be deployed against striking workers in Greece? The implementation of the demands set out in the Annual Report on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would mean a quantum leap in the EU’s military development and an expansion of military intervention worldwide, probably with a robust mandate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Much of this, including Member States’ obligation to develop their military capabilities, has to do with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.

      <p sl="bg">In view of the number of new challenges before the world and European security it is time for the European Union to further develop and enhance its Common Security and Defence Policy. A specific example would be the question of the potential impact of climate change, natural disasters and military crises on European security and of how should the Union be prepared to react? My opinion is that we must build a European military capacity but also that it should not be our first choice and to avail of it firstly in the event of natural disasters. Also, considering the restricted budget available, it is not the increase of administration and the creation of new policies but the enhancement of the already existing instruments which will lead to a more efficient reaction in the event of such crises. Ladies and gentlemen, the power of the European Union lies in being a leader in the provision of humanitarian aid in the event of disaster and in our cooperation with a number of partners to guarantee the security of our citizens and of the people worldwide. The Common Security and Defence Policy may complement but not replace these well functioning Union instruments.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, today we are discussing four reports that seek to breathe new life into our Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This is a clear sign of the conviction that our security and defence have a clear European dimension, contrary to the beliefs of the Eurosceptic minorities, some of whom can be found in this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank Mr Danjean for his commitment to finding a consensus when preparing his report, which contains other important contributions from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. These include the references to effective multilateralism, the principle of the ‘responsibility to protect’ and the concept of human security. We would like to see those aspects included in a future revision of the European defence strategy.</p>
      <p sl="es">We stressed, too, that a strong CSDP is also important for our transatlantic alliance. I must mention another of the challenges that is assuming significant importance for our global security: cyber security and cyber defence, aspects that are dealt with in a report that we are discussing today as well. We hope that its proposals will be included in the new European cyber security strategy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Against a backdrop of severe economic and financial crisis, in which the Member States are being forced to cut their defence budgets, it is all the more necessary to implement the European ‘pooling and sharing programmes’. It is therefore more important than ever to strengthen the role of the European Defence Agency, over which there is much debate today.</p>
      <p sl="es">In conclusion, we can relaunch European security and defence and we can do so with President Van Rompuy’s plan for the December 2013 Council. Thank you, all four rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I congratulate the four rapporteurs and would point out that each report deserves a debate. Each report brings added value to our Common Security and Defence Policy. I will address the matter in principle: the Treaty of Lisbon provides the legal basis for this policy. We can no longer doubt that, but we can still doubt our ability to implement it. Though this Treaty came into force a few years ago, and we are talking about a larger and better managed Europe, we are not putting the commitments we have made into practice.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This makes the Union weak in matters of external policy and global security. If we want a stronger Union, a stronger Europe, we must give the Common Security and Defence Policy a chance, and not act individually, as we have done to date, and even today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Just look at the language. The EU ‘should be a global political player on the international scene’ it says, ‘to protect its interests in the world and to ensure the security of its citizens’. All under the roof of a single political authority. It says, the EU has ‘an important role to play as security provider for the Member States’ and it wants mergers of European businesses to contribute to European defence industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, here is the real aim of this shameful BAE/EADS merger proposal.</p>

      <p sl="es">At the 1999 Washington summit, it approved a Strategic Concept that allowed military intervention outside the United Nations Security Council and a military response to phenomena such as terrorism and organised crime, which had previously warranted a civilian response.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this last point clearly shows that we need to do things differently. If we abolish parallel structures and make use of synergies in procurement, research and other areas and move towards a system of pooling and sharing, instead of every Member State having to deal with everything, we can achieve more with less money. If we consider that we have armed forces in Europe in which 60, 70 or even 80 % of the members work in administration, and if we consider how many soldiers there are in Europe and what proportion of them is genuinely ready for deployment, it is clear how much money is being wasted here. The Member States are calling for cuts in the European budget, but in the defence sector, we could save so much money through synergies, cooperation and burden-sharing. In fact, the potential savings are several times greater than the sums generated by the austerity measures that we are currently discussing for the main EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, we do need to talk about some of the national idiosyncrasies, customs and, indeed, vanities. We need to draw on the knowledge of the politicians responsible for the national budgets in order to improve Europe’s presence in the field of security and defence policy as well, with a view to safeguarding our capabilities here.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Four years ago the European Union announced that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity. We have just seven years left to stop climate change doing irreparable damage. Unfortunately, when hit by the crisis, we put this most sensitive problem to one side. In all the most important EU documents we should consider the impact of climate change on global security and establish an international working group which would increase the capacities of the EU and its Member States to forecast and eradicate the natural disasters caused by climate change and their consequences. There needs to be better coordination of cooperation between the EU Member States, the European Commission and the US, as well as China, Russia and Brazil. We require both a European and a global early warning mechanism. The armies of the countries of the world, particularly the large countries, should use energy resources more efficiently and thus contribute to stopping climate change.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Brok has rightly drawn attention to the added value that we could achieve through more security and defence cooperation. Mr Danjean’s report lists a number of examples. For example, we are calling for a greater willingness from Member States to cooperate on pooling and sharing, as reaffirmed in the Council conclusions at the start of this week.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Military Staff produced a list of around 300 suitable projects in 2011. Currently, the EU is pursuing only 11 projects. It is worth asking what has happened to all the others. Why are Member States not willing to assume responsibility as lead nations?</p>
      <p sl="de">Here is another example. At the NATO Summit in Chicago in May 2012, Lady Ashton presented the air-to-air refuelling project as a key contribution to plugging EU and NATO capability gaps. The latest Council conclusions also focus on progress in this field. My question, however, is this: which specific capability gaps have in fact been closed?</p>
      <p sl="de">It could be argued, could it not, that the steps taken by the Member States so far actually amount to no more than statements of intent and lack any real substance. To the best of my knowledge, France will merely replace its existing air-to-air refuelling capacities, and although Germany supports this initiative, it has not identified any additional requirement for new capacities of this kind at the national level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Earlier this week, the United Kingdom and Germany did not sign the letter of intent on the implementation of a European strategic air transport and participation initiative. How do the announcements and omissions fit together? I hope that the Council conclusions, which also refer to the defence summit next year, will help to ensure that Parliament’s demands in relation to this area will be reflected in the summit outcome document.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the recession cannot be used as justification for a lack of investment by Member States in security and defence in this world which is becoming increasingly dangerous because of deregulation. It is precisely because of the crisis and the challenges that we face on a global scale that the European Union should coordinate and integrate policies, resources and capabilities in security and defence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This means making progress with the permanent headquarters, and also pooling and sharing human resources, equipment and also funds. The rule that ‘costs lie where they fall’ prevents some States from contributing more in terms of civilian and military capabilities and forces to Common Security and Defence Policy missions. This Parliament’s recommendations in these reports – implementation of the solidarity clause, cyber defence, security implications in climate change – are essential in order for the European Union to be strategically independent, and can also help the European countries to assume their commitments within the context of NATO, the United Nations and other strategic partnerships, as global security suppliers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. I am grateful, finally, to have the floor. Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) sounds impressive, and rightly so, but I think we all realise – because, from listening to colleagues from different political groups, I have the impression that, in many cases, we share the same view – that the CSDP still presents a huge challenge: firstly, because the world is a dangerous place and, secondly, because the policy has yet to be fully implemented. We must recognise, unfortunately, that not all European Union Member States, including one of the largest, are involved in the development of the CSDP. It is with regret that I must acknowledge that.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nevertheless, it is good that ministers are meeting and that a European Council on security and defence policy is scheduled for next year. It is good that ministers from almost all the largest European Union Member States are putting forward proposals for the CSDP. These proposals are also ones that we in the European Parliament have made, and I hope that Member State leaders, the Commission and the High Representative will listen carefully to our proposals, as we are one of the bodies which support a Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>

With cyber criminals getting better at breaking into protected networks, I strongly believe that the only real way to win the battle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them. I would remind you of some statistics: more than one million people become victims of cyber crime every day, and the cost of cyber crime, as estimated by the Commission, could reach a total of USD 388 billion worldwide. Therefore, as I have stated in all my speeches, I believe ‘white hat’ hackers need to be hired and trained for future cyber warfare.</p>

Many cyber incidents are caused by unreliable and weak private and public infrastructure networks, insecure databases and other critical IT infrastructure failures. We call on the Member States to develop national cyber security and defence strategies, to train specialised engineers in the protection of IT networks and invest in cyber security research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Network and Information Security Agency supports the Member States through exchanges of best practices of IT security, and by developing, implementing and maintaining national cyber security strategies. We want to see a stronger ENISA and the European Parliament calls for an extended international and operational mandate for this agency. We ask the Council and the Commission to be flexible in this regard, given that ENISA’s current mandate expires in September 2013.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon gave the Union new external action instruments that helped to consolidate its international profile. The Common Security and Defence Policy provides for military and civilian missions in vulnerable areas. Having intervened in Chad, Congo and Somalia, the Union failed to deal appropriately with the stalled conflicts at its own borders. The best example is the Transnistrian conflict, which has been going on for more than 20 years. Much was expected from the new Tiraspol regime but the latest rounds of negotiations have proved inauspicious and the initial commitment to end the conflict has proven to be disingenuous. That is why I believe that the Union, through its High Representative, should commit itself further to ending the conflict by replacing the military peace-keeping mission with a civilian one.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There are two fundamental reasons for this unwelcome situation. Firstly, there is still unwillingness among a group of Member States to participate in this joint European venture in the field of security and defence. These countries believe that Europe can make do with just NATO. In my opinion, they are wrong.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second reason is the lack of satisfactory results with regard to the creation of joint capabilities. I am referring here chiefly to the potential in the aviation sector, to air-to-air refuelling and to the need for pilotless aircraft. In this respect, it is a case of too many words and not enough action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, these reports which we are now discussing clearly support the reinforcement of the military component, and also the pretensions to imperialism and recolonisation of the planet which were developed in the Treaty of Lisbon. They assert that the Member States should place their civilian and military capabilities at the Union’s disposal in order to contribute to the Council-defined objectives, which are subordinate to the obligation policies stemming from NATO, an interfering politico-military bloc which has occupied countries and massacred people at the behest of major economic interests.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Further steps are now being taken along this road, with the establishment of the misnamed solidarity clause, which provides that States should take military action in a country, not only if this is involved in a military conflict, but also, apparently, if it is the target of cyber attacks or natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet against whom will they take military action? What will be the objectives? This package of measures simply confirms the European Union as a politico-military bloc which, by centralising and expanding European military equipment, is not only reneging on its values of peace, but also poses a threat to the freedom and sovereignty of the people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, you have come up with a number of suggestions on how to improve our approach and our actions and I consider the report instrumental for our policy debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has been an interesting and I think a very important debate. Not least because, in the context of looking at the economic situation that Member States and institutions find themselves in, it is absolutely vital that we discuss how best to make sure that we are able to respond to some of the crises and security threats we are faced with as individual nations, as parliamentarians and as institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased to note the relevance that the conclusions adopted on Monday by the Foreign Affairs/Defence Council chaired by the High Representative/Vice-President have in this respect and that they are in line with the contents of your reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just remind you of a couple of key elements which are relevant to our debate today. By this I would like to convince Mr Van Orden to take a more positive view on CSDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Monday’s conclusions stressed that capabilities underpin the EU’s ability to act as a security provider in the context of a wider comprehensive approach. Also, the Council underlines the necessity to maximise the effectiveness of Europe’s defence expenditure in times of financial austerity, including through pooling and sharing.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also stresses the wider impact of the defence sector on innovation, technology and growth and the need for synergies with wider EU policies in these fields</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Van Orden says that the EU does not need military means and can leave this to NATO. But is Operation Atalanta not an example that an EU military mission has an effect and is useful? It has an effect on piracy and it has been cooperating very well with NATO. The same can be said about our training mission in Somalia, which has had a positive effect on strengthening the Somalian Government. If I am correct, the British Government is supporting these EU operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to recall that the United States in their strategic review asked for greater responsibility and a greater role for the European Union as a security provider in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of a special representative dealing with climate security, the European Union is already focussing political attention on climate security challenges through its established structures. The European Union is also sponsoring international debate including at the level of the UN Security Council. The priority appears to be to continue building up awareness and capacities at the multilateral level and in regional fora. In this regard, we take note of the report’s recommendation to work towards the nomination of a special envoy at United Nations level. The European Union is already coordinating its action on climate security aspects with the UN and its agencies. The nomination of a UN envoy would help this ongoing coordination and help maintain political visibility at UN level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end by saying – as the High Representative/Vice-President constantly does – how proud we are and should be of the servicemen and women who are operating in theatre at the present time. As we move towards Christmas and for us a holiday season, I am very conscious that men and women are serving across the world and especially, as was mentioned, in very dangerous places.</p>

It is very pleasing to see such a broad consensus that the European Union has to equip itself with the means to achieve a global, international ambition, including a security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like the Minister, I am sorry that our British colleagues still have a very ideological and completely unpragmatic position, which is reflected in their actions. They have spoken here as the representatives of a great military nation, but they should not be under any illusions. That great military nation is also going to suffer, and is already suffering, a considerable strategic decline, with defence budget cuts, and problems with materials and human resources, like all European countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, NATO is our last resource, but NATO will not be able to intervene always and everywhere to defend European interests. Some Member States are not members of NATO. Some NATO countries will not always be prepared to defend European interests. We have to face up to that possibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must therefore maintain a form of autonomy, which is not rivalry, competition or duplication, but intelligent complementarity. That is already the case across all of the European Union’s missions: more than a dozen missions are being carried out successfully today and are expected – and this is the most important aspect – by the countries that are in crisis. They recognise the European Union’s legitimacy and, undoubtedly, they would not be prepared to do that for any other international actor.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am satisfied that there seems to be almost a consensus about the need to create a united EU cyber defence and cyber security strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to mention one fact, namely that two years ago we decided to aim for a level of at least 2 % expenditure on defence, research and development from the general defence budget. So far only one Member State has done this, whereas five Member States have spent nothing on R&amp;D so far. In this field there are no smart solutions possible to save more money. Defence and security are costly and we have to meet these expenses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention the role of the European Defence Agency and ENISA. Their role can, and should, be enhanced in assisting our Member States, in helping to pool and share the existing experience and in developing a good practice guide.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with regard to international cooperation, I think the role of the EU, and especially the Commission, is to mainstream cyber security aspects in all relations with third countries, to encourage our partners to join the Budapest Convention and to agree on minimum standards on responsible behaviour in cyber space. The EU should also assist third countries, if needed, to build their cyber security facilities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I congratulate Mr Kelam on his report, which addresses one of the most important aspects of European security, the issue of cyber security. The concept of cyber security inextricably links the internal and external dimensions of security, whether we are referring to cyber espionage, cyber terrorism or cyber crime. Cyber attacks are global in character and hence effective defence must be global too. We must underline the need to ensure continuous close cooperation and avoid duplication by the European Union institutions, the EU, NATO and the major international actors, Member States, civil and military defence forces, and the public and private sector. The knowledge and skills being built up in the private sector are needed for effective defence whether we are talking about internet security firms, software developers, hardware manufacturers or online systems operators. In future, vital informatics infrastructures could become a key target for cyber terrorism. To protect these we can no longer put off developing a common European system for assessing threats on the one hand, and extending common European practice concerning preparation, prevention, detection and response. International organised crime is transferring its operations to the cyber sphere with astonishing speed, often employing experts who have acquired specialised skills in military organisations or through secret service connections. For example, a notable feature of Russian and Russian-speaking cyber crime is that in many cases the network is run by former KGB officers and supplied with information that can be used with considerable effect for the purpose of blackmail or to exert pressure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Several countries are actively preparing for the cyber war by setting up cyber defence units, as well as intelligence and IT penetration structures. Numerous public and private bodies are attacked on a daily basis. Far-reaching IT offensives have been launched in recent years around the world. Modern, highly computerised societies are vulnerable to this; companies, public authorities, and vital economic and industrial infrastructures are the future victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From a technical perspective, never has a range of technologies impregnated human activity so quickly and deeply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The development of a safer cyberspace requires the states to be more involved in network regulation and crisis management. It is therefore essential for Europe to present itself as the discussion and regulation platform in this area. On too many occasions recently, we have had before us, here in the European Parliament, texts that have, unfortunately, tended to try to do away with some of our individual freedoms, under various different pretexts.

      <p sl="pl">The increase in extreme weather events also means higher costs for the European economy, both for those countries still developing and those deemed to be economically stable. The occurrence of natural disasters is a fact and requires the European Union Member States to act jointly to tackle the devastating effects of these disasters. The EU’s priority in this regard should be to ensure that people have access to fresh water and food following a natural disaster. To that end, a far-sighted crisis response and management policy deployed across 27 Member States must be established. It is also necessary, therefore, to assess which countries or regions are at greatest risk of natural disasters. A list of those countries or regions must then be drawn up and annual reports presented that indicate potential threats and propose measures for mitigating their impact. Of course, the European Union must also work with other regions of the world in this regard, in order to gain a global overview of potential security threats. Furthermore, it is important to continue to provide and to step up EU humanitarian aid, not only within Europe but also beyond it. The Commission should make the successful elimination of risks associated with natural disasters part of its main development strategy measures, so that areas likely to be affected and their authorities can feel secure and certain that they will receive assistance in the event of a natural disaster.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A7-0355/2012) by Liisa Jaakonsaari, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, containing the European Parliament’s recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service on the negotiations for an EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement (2012/2153(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as rapporteur of the EU-Kazakhstan report, I have the pleasure of opening this debate by presenting to you our recommendations on the negotiations. The recommendations we are now dealing with are the result of an intensive process of cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, including consultation with stakeholders, experts and the valuable debriefings by our chief negotiator, Mr Wiegand. I also would like to thank the INTA Committee for their very good opinion and it has been my endeavour to ensure consistency with our EU policies and strategies on Central Asia and on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The golden rule that we stressed in Parliament’s March resolution is that economic development must be linked to political development, and therefore progress in the negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement must be linked to progress in political reforms. In fact, this meets Kazakhstan’s important commitments and obligations to international and European standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, declarations have to be followed up by tangible and concrete steps. In this regard, it was negative news that the appeal of Mr Kozlov was turned down by the court. This appeal process was open but not fair. A serious concern we took note of is the legal move to shut down and ban the independent media outlets, as we heard yesterday. We are very concerned about the further limitation of political freedoms and the independent media and call on Kazakhstan to repeal the vague criminal charge of ‘inciting social unrest’ in its criminal code.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recommendations focus on three main topics: first on economic cooperation, second on the political dialogue and cooperation, including with regard to security in the region, and thirdly on the really crucial issue of human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, economy, trade, investment, energy and security matter for both partners. To extend trade and foreign investment the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers is necessary. The convergence of standards towards EU standards would favour the modernisation or diversification of Kazakhstan’s economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On human rights and democracy, the EU and Kazakhstan still need to find a common language during the ongoing PCA negotiations. Kazakhstan needs to bring its legal system fully in line with international standards. Kazakhstan should draw on the assistance and recommendations of the Venice Commission and finally ensure the full implementation of its very good human rights action plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">We support visa facilitation between the EU and Kazakhstan. In every sense, we give our strong support for legal, academic and vocational training and for cultural exchange programmes, and we call on Kazakhstan to hold an impartial investigation into all recent allegations of torture and ill-treatment in connection with violence in Zhanaozen.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all this is a fair and balanced report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to brief you on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on the latest developments and the European Union’s activities in Kazakhstan. I would like to warmly thank Mrs Jaakonsaari for her excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan has been an important partner for the EU in Central Asia, not only on trade and economic exchanges, but as a stable country which has a proven track record of inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony and tolerance. The EU has a strategic interest in further deepening our involvement with Kazakhstan and in developing fully the potential for political cooperation; especially considering the rapidly evolving dynamics of regional integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan is a pragmatic partner, open to discussions and willing to explore opportunities. The European Union, in return, is a very important trade and investment partner for Kazakhstan: more than half of the total foreign and direct investment in the country comes from EU investors. Over the past years, we have increased cooperation, have had frequent high-level meetings and launched negotiations for a new enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiation of the new agreement proves the importance of Kazakhstan for the EU, and is the recognition of our strong economic and strategic relations. However, as underlined by the Vice President/High Representative on many occasions before, the enhancement of EU-Kazakhstan relations is not independent of the advancement of domestic political reforms and the protection and promotion of human rights in Kazakhstan. This is a priority for the European Parliament but also for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has been observing the political and human rights related developments in Kazakhstan since the tragic events of Zhanaozen in December 2011 with serious concern. This included the monitoring of the trials of the people accused of inciting or participating in the violent events of Zhanaozen, by the EU Delegation in Astana, in line with the Parliament’s appeals to do so in its resolution of 15 March 2012. We have seen several procedural shortcomings in the trial processes and fear that the verdicts given have been mainly based on political activism and the general involvement of the defendants in trade union or opposition movements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative/Vice-President Ashton has encouraged, and will continue to encourage, the Kazakh authorities to review the trial processes, in line with the international commitments and obligations of Kazakhstan. The EU has also called for the right to a free, fair and transparent appeal process for Mr Kozlov and all other defendants.</p>
      <p sl="en">We fully support Parliament when it calls on Kazakhstan as a member of the Venice Commission, and also as a newly elected member of the UN Human Rights Council, to demonstrate its strong commitment to Human Rights, including the freedoms of speech, of assembly, of association and of religion and belief. The European Union will continue to make this point in all bilateral contacts and cooperation fora, as we did just last week again during the EU-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee meeting and will do during upcoming negotiation rounds on the new PCA.</p>
      <p sl="en">The respect for democracy, the principles of international law, fundamental freedoms and human rights is an essential component of the new EU-Kazakhstan agreement. This means that, once the new agreement enters into force, the violation of this essential element could lead to the suspension of parts or all of the agreement. This is in line with the report where the Honourable Members of the Parliament stress that, although used rarely, the suspension of the application of any PCA is possible in the case of serious breaches of human rights. In this regard, the PCA will strengthen the dialogue with Kazakhstan on human rights through our regular dialogues. Human rights will undoubtedly be raised by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton during her upcoming visit to Astana next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">As also called for by the report, the Commission services and the EEAS are doing their utmost to ensure that the new agreement is a comprehensive one, with emphasis on political, legal, economic and social reforms. In line with this, our aim is to broaden the scope of our cooperation with Kazakhstan in a number of areas and also help the Kazakh authorities’ reform and modernisation efforts. This includes encouraging Kazakhstan’s efforts for legislative conformity with the EU acquis and WTO rules. Kazakhstan has the EU’s full support for WTO accession, and in particular an early conclusion of the ongoing negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is likely that the negotiations on the new PCA will be concluded following Kazakhstan’s WTO accession, so the negotiations of the PCA are based on this assumption. In this regard, the European Union expects that the customs union between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus will not constitute a barrier for enhanced cooperation with the European Union – as also stated in the European Parliament report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiation of a new PCA is not a simple or short process. Through this process, the European Union is committed to standing alongside Kazakhstan and its citizens, both as a friend and as a partner, on the path of political reform and economic development. In this endeavour, we will continue to provide full information to Parliament, as we have been doing so far. We count on the support of Parliament and we look forward to the resolution that you will adopt tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for what is, in my view, an excellent report which covers the many different facets of our relations with Kazakhstan in a truly outstanding manner. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to talk about four aspects which are particularly important to us. First of all, as the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned, Kazakhstan is seeking accession to the WTO, and that means, of course, that it must comply with and implement WTO rules. It will also be subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement regime. This is an important step towards transparency and fairness.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, when we talk about transparency and fairness, raw materials are, of course, an issue of great relevance in this context. Kazakhstan’s economy is geared mainly towards the raw materials sector, so the main priority here is to create workable tax and financial frameworks, but without losing sight of the environmental dimension. The aim must be to ensure that raw materials extraction serves the interests of the people of Kazakhstan but also safeguards the interests of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, this includes the issue of phosphorus, for example. We cannot have a situation in which the export of phosphorus involves the use of dumping practices, ultimately putting a question mark over well-established structures in the European Union. We support trade, but it must take place under conditions which are fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, as in all the trade agreements concluded by the EU, trade also means fair conditions of competition in the fields of workers’ rights and environmental standards. For that reason, we also need to include a sound and viable chapter on sustainable development in the agreement. We want this demand to be reflected in the resolution; that is our firm position.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Ms Jaakonsaari, the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs for making constructive cooperation possible</p>
      <p sl="de">As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I am a firm advocate of this new and enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan. Both sides wish to enhance their cooperation in order to do justice to Kazakhstan’s extremely important political, economic and geostrategic role in the region. Our values, such as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are the foundation of all the EU’s relations with its partners in the wider world. The agreement with Kazakhstan should therefore also include unambiguous provisions relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in accordance with international standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must follow Kazakhstan’s reform initiatives and offer active support, including technical assistance, for implementing these reforms. Here, the focus should be on establishing an independent civil society and a functioning administration under the rule of law, and developing the education system. A pluralistic political system in which opposition parties and civil society can express their opinions freely and unhindered is the foundation of every democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This enhanced agreement has a particularly important role to play in relation to the diversification of Kazakhstan’s economy and more intensive political relations, especially in this area of tension between east and west; Russia and China should also be mentioned in this context.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I would like to ask Ms Jeggle whether she has seen the statement made by the official representative of the General Prosecutor in Kazakhstan just yesterday: he effectively said that he would issue a lawsuit to ban all of the opposition political forces in the country, as well as all of the independent and opposition media in the country. In light of that, does she not think that she can reconsider her support for a PCA at this stage, and that it should be suspended until there is proven improvement in respect of human rights in the country?</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, we are aware of this statement. We have seen the e-mail from an NGO on this issue and, in the meantime, have also obtained information from the European External Action Service (EEAS). We cannot draw any firm conclusions yet; all that we have is the announcement about these plans. I am informed by the EEAS that intensive enquiries will be made. We have just held an in-depth discussion of the matter in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Together with the rapporteur, Ms Jaakonsaari, we have drafted an oral amendment which we will table jointly and would ask the House to support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to say that my breath is taken away when the Cyprus Presidency tonight calls Kazakhstan, I quote, ‘a pragmatic partner, a friend, having strong strategic relations with the EU’, relations which the Presidency seek to have enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="en">I met Yevgeny Zhovtis, whom Liisa Jaakonsaari and I campaigned to get released – a human rights leader who has been imprisoned on trumped-up charges. We also met Vladimir Kozlov, the opposition leader, now, as the Presidency rightly says, imprisoned for seven and a half years after a political trial, a trial in which no questions and no exchanges took place in the courtroom and where the judge delivered his verdict in less than two minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Jeggle, Agence France Presse has confirmed independently that Respublika, Vzglyad, Golos Respubliki, K Plus TV and StanTV are to be banned as supposedly extremist, in what appears to be an attempt to stop independent media.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, human rights activists would be shocked that the EU is seeking enhanced partnership in these circumstances and I ask the President-in-Office in her reply to confirm there is already a human rights clause in the agreement with Kazakhstan and to say hand on heart that she does not believe it has already been breached.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, as shadow rapporteur, I want to congratulate Ms Jaakonsaari on this report. Kazakhstan is certainly a big, important country in a strategically vital region for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sometimes we choose to work with poor and small developing countries with democratic problems and human rights problems, but countries in Central Asia, and especially this country, are in a different position. Do not forget that they are former Soviet republics. Do not forget that they belong to a different culture. In order to alleviate the situation and to export our standards we must cooperate. If we want to export our values, the key word with a country like this is cooperation. We are asking the impossible if we want them to share these values automatically.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must certainly criticise; we certainly do not agree with the human rights violations; we are continually calling for the release of political prisoners; but in order to achieve this and to alleviate the human rights situation, we must work together. My position, and that of my group, is that a PCA with Kazakhstan is needed. I believe that it is necessary to work together in the interests of the region through trade, political dialogue and cooperation. I hope we will be able to change and perhaps improve the democratic situation in this country, but if we do not do anything and if we only offer criticism, we are taking a risk that our voice will not be heard. Can you imagine the voice of Russia or China being more powerful in Kazakhstan when it comes to changing the human rights situation? As I have already pointed out, the key issue for relations with such countries is cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I condemn the decision of the Appellate Court in Aktau to sentence the opposition politician Vladimir Kozlov to seven and a half years in prison. His trial, monitored closely by the international community, has been described as staged, as a ‘Soviet-style’ trial. There is absolutely no concrete evidence against Mr Kozlov. He is accused of having spoken out against his country when abroad, in particular in his speeches in the European Parliament. It is unacceptable for opponents and defenders of human rights invited to Parliament to be at risk once they return home and even imprisoned.

We hope this agreement can speed up the political and economic reforms necessary for Kazakhstan to accede to the World Trade Organisation, establishing an important trading partner, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which currently encounter some difficulty in gaining access to the Asian market.</p>

      <p sl="nl">New reports about continuing attacks on churches in Kazakhstan, both registered and unregistered churches, underline the concerns of this House on this matter. Meanwhile the Council of Baptist Churches has reported that this summer some government officials, would you believe, threatened to confiscate homes where unregistered Baptist services were being held.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have just heard from the Council that the High Representative will hold talks in Astana next week.

Kazakhstan is crucial for the stability and strategic future of Central Asia and is without doubt an important economic and trading partner for the EU. The country has already launched a process of economic and democratic reform, although much remains to be achieved in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the country has shown itself to be committed to further and more far-reaching reforms and I think that the duty of the EU is to support this process. To this end, I am certain that the signing of this enhanced agreement will allow progress to be made, because it will strengthen an already solid and productive relationship and ensure constant assistance from the EU. I am also convinced – and I think that this should have been underlined more clearly in the report to be voted tomorrow – that greater progress in the areas of democracy and human rights should be met by renewed reciprocal efforts that are both open and constructive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our aim should not be to place ourselves on a negative footing with this or that country if change is not achieved immediately, but rather to support the efforts by these countries to attain the objective of respect for the principle of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU Strategy for Central Asia came into being five years ago. If we look at the state of implementation of this Strategy today, the outcomes are ambivalent. We see Member States, on an individual basis, endeavouring to cultivate good economic links, particularly with the resource-rich countries in this region, but we also see that the efforts to support these countries’ transition to modern, democratic societies are not progressing, or – as recent events in Kazakhstan show – are marred by setbacks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite, or perhaps because of this, the European Union and its Member States must make more intensive efforts to exert influence jointly in the region, particularly in relation to Kazakhstan, which is now one of the main suppliers of oil to numerous EU countries. Any attempt by the EU to isolate Kazakhstan will simply allow the EU’s competitors for influence in this geopolitically strategic country, who attach less importance to urging respect for human and civil rights, to wield even greater influence than before.</p>
      <p sl="de">Linkage between economic interests and respect for civil rights is at the heart of the EU Strategy for Central Asia. This should also be the basis for further negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan. The present report offers a good framework for this process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, it is essential for the European Union to strengthen both political and economic ties with the country. The existing cooperation in the fields of energy, education and others is a good basis for further cooperation. It is crucial that the European Union supports Kazakhstan’s moves towards an improved investment climate, diversified exports and tariff negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the European Union should use the enhanced PCA as a platform to promote improvement of relations between Kazakhstan and other countries in the Central Asia region.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have twice had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan to monitor human rights issues. I believe that this agreement is necessary, because we need to regulate our trade and economic relations. At the same time, we must not allow ourselves to forget that the Kazakh opposition is currently in huge difficulties. Vladimir Kozlov has been sentenced to seven years in prison for fighting for the rights of workers who died in the town of Zhanaozen. By way of comparison, the police officers who shot at the workers received five-year prison sentences. We have learnt today that the public prosecutor wants to shut down the activities of all independent media outlets: 23 news and television portals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that we should adopt certain amendments to this report today in order to show that we are seeking to enforce human rights. I therefore call on the Kazakh authorities and on Baroness Ashton and the European External Action Service to take the necessary steps to support the activities of independent media outlets, and I urge us to adopt this agreement, but with amendments that will guarantee respect for human rights in Kazakhstan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for the open and interesting exchanges we had on Kazakhstan today.</p>
      <p sl="en">This debate has been very useful and helps the European Union to inform its policy on Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Relations between the European Union and Kazakhstan are at a turning point since the joint decision to enhance bilateral relations in 2009 and the start of the negotiations for a new PCA agreement in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan is one of the key partners of the European Union in Central Asia and with the future deepening of the EU’s cooperation with Kazakhstan, there is a need for such open debates and analyses of the EU’s policies towards Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has been supporting the reform process in Kazakhstan both in the political and economic spheres since 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have not only been looking at economic development and business competitiveness in Kazakhstan but also concentrating on good governance and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel, the European Union has been dedicating considerable efforts to the development of civil society as well as engaging on human rights and rule of law issues with Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach of representing the EU’s interests in seeing progress in political reforms and in deepening our economic engagement with Kazakhstan is a balanced one.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we have been surprised and are concerned by the initiative taken by the Almati Prosecutor-General’s office in declaring the Alta Party and People’s Friend Movement as extremists along with eight independent newspapers and 23 internet outlets and banning them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course the European Union supports efforts to combat extremism and terrorist activities. However, combating extremists should not be used to justify restricting human rights. Human rights and the respect for the rule of law are best secured through open dialogue, political pluralism and a vibrant civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">You can be sure that I will pass on your comments and your advice to the High Representative/Vice-President who will make a visit to Kazakhstan next week and remains as committed as ever to ensuring that this partnership develops in a way that promotes both economic development and human rights commitments.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is a commitment to human rights in the opening of Article 2 of the current 1999 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Therefore, if we have negotiations for an enhanced agreement, is she really saying that the commitments set out in the 1999 agreement have been fulfilled?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the negotiations for the agreement between Kazakhstan and the EU are indeed a test for the European Union with regard to how the soft power of the European Union is used properly, and this is also a test for Parliament with regard to how we will use the opportunity given to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon to influence the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It was encouraging to hear the address by the High Representative and President-in-Office concerning the fact that the negotiations may indeed be suspended if the human-rights situation is in fact going in the direction implied by yesterday’s news.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I do not regard postponement of the vote as any sort of solution; on the contrary, there must now be clear guidelines for Parliament concerning how the High Representative will proceed, what sort of addresses she might make and what stance she will adopt on the matter during the visit and, above all, how these negotiations will progress. Therefore, Parliament must now have clear guidelines for the negotiations, and it is important that Parliament is kept informed and, as Ms Jeggle suggested, we will request an oral amendment to these presentations tomorrow, given yesterday’s bad news, so that the Kazakh authorities actually rescind the decisions to restrict media freedom and which will in practice make the work of the opposition even more difficult, or perhaps impossible.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to extend my warm thanks for an interesting debate, and I hope and consider it important that Parliament will be kept continuously informed of how the negotiations are progressing; tomorrow we will issue instructions regarding what must be done in the forthcoming negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="et">I recognise Kazakhstan’s political will and practical actions to strengthen its partnership with the EU and the commencement of negotiations for an EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement. In this context, it is essential to ensure that the new partnership and cooperation agreement is a comprehensive framework for the further development of relations, addressing all priority areas, including human rights, the rule of law, democratisation, youth and education, economic development, trade and investment, energy and transport, environmental sustainability and water, and combating common threats and challenges.</p>
      <p sl="et">Certainly, there should be close cooperation with Kazakhstan to develop peaceful and progressive relations in Central Asia in order to ensure positive developments in that area. Areas such as water and resource management, border management, the fight against extremism and counter-terrorism should be highlighted. The conclusion of the new partnership and cooperation agreement negotiations will have a positive impact on the deepening of economic cooperation between EU and Kazakh companies, including SMEs, and increase the overall economic benefits for both parties. Attention should also be paid to technical assistance to Kazakhstan in the field of water conservation and management of water resources in general, in the framework of the EU Water Initiative for Central Asia, with a view to improving relations between upstream and downstream countries in the area and reaching sustainable water-sharing agreements. Hopefully, the new agreement will achieve considerable progress.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is up to all of us to ensure that Kazakhstan becomes a stable democracy and that nothing prevents us from strengthening our economic ties. I welcome the political will and commitment shown by Kazakhstan to deepening further its partnership with the EU. The human rights situation is worrying. In the European Union, human rights are non-negotiable. Respect for freedom, democracy and human rights therefore forms the basis for the deepening of relations between third countries and the EU. In December last year, I organised a seminar on the trials of opposition activists following the events of December 2011 in the town of Zhanaozen. It was with great concern that I listened to accounts of the worsening human rights situation in Kazakhstan. I therefore echo the motion for a resolution in calling on the Kazakh authorities to release prisoners convicted on political grounds and to commit to bringing the legal system fully into line with international standards. All the recommendations included in the motion for a resolution are a prerequisite for the launch of negotiations for an enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan. Specific, measurable, attainable and timely objectives must be set with regard to human rights and democratic principles, aimed at increasing respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Our motion for a resolution contains the first such set of objectives. Now the ball is in the Kazakh authorities’ court.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement concerning the proposed data protection directive – personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-505-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission presented the reform proposal for the EU data protection regime in January for two reasons: first, to ensure a high level of data protection for individuals as provided for in the treaties and second, to offer European businesses a future-proof and technologically neutral data protection regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must now make rapid progress to reach agreement on the package on the table. In Parliament the progress has been particularly noticeable in the different working documents and draft reports prepared by the rapporteurs. For the Commission, progress means that the regulation and the directive continue to be negotiated as a package. The freedom and security of our European citizens are two sides of the same coin. These are two policy objectives that should be reached with the adoption of the proposals to reform the European Union rules on data protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the personal data processed in the context of police and judicial cooperation, we currently have a multitude of rules and different legal instruments. The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty allows the establishment of a comprehensive data protection framework. We can ensure a high level of protection for individuals’ data whilst respecting the specific nature of the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. In particular, the revised EU data protection framework can now cover both cross-border and domestic processing of personal data. This would reduce differences between the legislation in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The status quo may not always facilitate the smooth exchange of information between Member States. The rules set by the pre-Lisbon Framework Decision that the proposed Directive aims to replace are limited to cross-border processing. In practice, police and law enforcement authorities may not have always distinguished between cross-border and domestic processing. It is not always feasible to draw this distinction in the daily work of a policeman or of a court. For instance, a single national database used in the law enforcement field may contain personal data that were both collected nationally and received from another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be inefficient to create two separate databases in such situations; it would also be inefficient to apply two different sets of data protection rules within a single database. The proposed directive aims to cover both domestic and cross-border processing. This has been a longstanding request from Parliament. The proposed directive also contains the same protection principles as those enshrined in the Regulation. This also echoes Parliament’s request to extend the application of the general data protection rules to the areas of police and judicial cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Key elements enshrined in the draft regulation are also introduced in the proposed directive, such as: data protection by design and by default; the appointment of data protection officers; the obligation to notify personal data breaches; and the extension of the powers of the Commission to adopt adequacy decisions for international transfers to third countries. These novelties emphasise the importance of robust protection rules in instruments allowing for data exchange. Let us never lose sight of the fact that the protection of personal data is a right enshrined in the Union’s Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the new data protection rules will have to be taken into account in sectoral instruments, in particular in the area of the former third pillar. Once a directive has entered into force the Commission, within three years, will have to review and possibly amend other acts adopted by the European Union which regulate the processing of personal data by law enforcement authorities.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I am delighted to have two minutes to speak about this very important subject, a subject that is important to all citizens and to all businesses, not only in the European Union but throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In 1995 we had a data protection directive, which was relevant for that particular time. Part of it dealt with the processing of personal data by the police and the judicial authorities. This was a framework decision. Over time, Parliament realised that this was becoming more and more outdated and called for a revision. It was never really effective, in some respects at least, because it dealt with cross-border processing, but not at national level by the police. It was also too loose, leading to a very wide range of interpretation at Member State level, the result being that some Member States had high data protection standards while others had very low ones. Of course the Commission had no implementing rules to ensure a common approach.</p>
      <p sl="ga">As the Commissioner pointed out, with the advent of the Lisbon Treaty – and obviously the development of the internet and the way the world has moved on since – it needs to be updated. Parliament itself would have preferred this single instrument but can live with the Commission’s proposals – a regulation and a directive. However, we are concerned about a number of aspects, particularly in relation to the lack of urgency at Council level to deal with the directive. There seems to be certain movement on the regulation, but not enough on the directive. I think for that reason we would ask the Council to bring forward a roadmap for how they are going to deal with it and also to ensure there is enough flexibility at Member State level not to have a dramatic rise in terms of standards in one and a dramatic drop in another. If we do that, we can make progress.</p>
      <p sl="ga">My final point is that I am pleased to say that the Irish Prime Minister approached me last Saturday week saying that during the Irish Presidency they would have this as one of their priorities.</p>

While I cannot predict what the Council is going to do, I think it is important that we take all these matters into consideration, and particularly that the Council should show some urgency regarding this matter so that we can get it completed, particularly during this mandate. I fear that if it is not completed by the end of next year, with elections pending in 2014, it might be very difficult to make much progress if there is too much left to be done in 2014.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I warmly thank the Commissioner for her presentation to the European Parliament and for today’s statement. It is self-evident, in my opinion, and we all agree, that the issue of the protection of European citizens’ personal data is extremely important and demands that we all treat it with the required gravity and attention. I wish to stress once more that we in the European Parliament do indeed attach great importance to this. The European Parliament therefore is and will continue to be extremely strict and demanding towards the other institutional bodies of the Union on this issue. As you know, Commissioner, from the outset the European Parliament wished to have a single legislative instrument, a regulation that would cover all aspects and all areas of personal data protection, with equal attention to the public and private sectors, and at the same time would include cases of processing of personal data by the judicial and police authorities. Unfortunately, our wish was not respected, with the result that today we have to deal with the proposals for a regulation and a directive. Parliament welcomed the Commission’s proposals, but we decided to deal with them as a single legislative package, both at a practical level and in terms of substance. I wish to emphasise that there cannot be a regulation without a directive, in our opinion. We shall insist on the rationale of the package in order to ensure coherence and legal certainty. Commissioner, I am glad that in your comments today you confirmed again that the Commission sees the regulation and directive as a single package and is treating them as such. Rest assured that we have no complaints about the Commission. On the contrary, our cooperation with the Commission is of a very high standard, and I have no hesitation in pointing this out from this rostrum, to express my gratitude to you. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the Council. I wonder why the Council is not present at today’s debate. Why is the Council not here today to answer the oral question we have put? Allow me to say that this is not only a sign of disrespect to the institution of the European Parliament, but it also gives the message, as I feel compelled to conclude, that the Council does not attach due importance to this crucial issue for European citizens. Unfortunately the Council is delaying its work on the directive. I wonder – and with good reason, I think – why the Council is refusing, as its stance indicates, to cooperate. Allow me, Mr President, to conclude by stressing that the European Parliament will defend its positions by whatever means it considers necessary and appropriate. The aim is to complete the procedures and implement the regulation and directive as a package, to provide European citizens with a high level of protection of their personal data.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for those of you who have been following the presidential election campaign in the US, you know what I am referring to when I say I feel a little bit like Clint Eastwood, talking to an empty chair, because once again, the Council is absent.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my colleagues have already outlined, this House will stick to the package approach, keeping the regulation and the directive together. But I would like to add one element and that is that the directive for us is a precondition for further police and justice cooperation and that is something that the Council should understand because the Council too has wishes. It wants to proceed as we do in the area of police and justice cooperation. But how can police and justice exchange data if there is no adequate data protection?</p>
      <p sl="de">So I would strongly advise the absent Council to proceed quickly with the directive and I would like to go a little bit further than my colleagues; instead of a roadmap let us aim for results and quick results. If the Council wants us to adopt further measures in the area of police and justice cooperation, I can think of a few interesting dossiers: EU PNR, investigation order and what have you. They had better speed up their work on the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to remind the Council that the predecessor of the directive, the framework decision which is currently in force, was actually voted down by this House. Unfortunately, that was pre-Lisbon. But we do not consider that the current framework decision is adequate, so whatever the Council comes up with, it will have to be a good deal better than what is currently in force.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we will work very hard to align the directive with the regulation because we are disappointed that there are two instruments rather than one and we will work very hard to try and ensure a single harmonised level of data protection for all use of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally colleagues, coming back to my reference to Clint Eastwood, I would like to say the following to the Council, as Clint Eastwood said in his role as Dirty Harry when a criminal was trying to defy him: ‘you have to ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky?’</p>
      <p sl="de">Council, will you defy Parliament? That is the question.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, our debate here today is not only about data protection. It is also about the future of police and judicial cooperation in Europe. For years, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers have been promoting cross-border cooperation between the law enforcement agencies. Generally speaking, there is nothing wrong with that; in fact, it is essential. In all these years, however, the European Parliament has made it clear that common standards for the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights are indispensable in this context. However, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers from our 27 governments, who, regrettably, are absent today, are still ignoring these demands. Instead, with the principle of mutual recognition of police measures, they are promoting what I can only describe as ‘blind faith’ in the legal systems of the EU Member States. They are ignoring the fact that there are still stark differences between the standards in place in the Member States, particularly in relation to data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">The present draft directive, which concerns data protection rules in the area of police cooperation in Europe, is intended to remedy this parlous state of affairs at long last. In truth, it is hardly a major step forward for the rights of the persons concerned, but it is an important first step, in that it would end the dangerous ‘race to the bottom’ in this area of data protection. With the onward march of information exchange, the risk of massive violations of fundamental rights is ever-present. Despite this situation, the Council is refusing to act swiftly and contribute to the process of framing the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a result, citizens will continue to cast doubt on the legitimacy of further measures for EU-wide police cooperation. We need common minimum standards in order to move closer to enhanced police and judicial cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, speaking as rapporteur for the EU PNR agreement and as a shadow on a number of other European policing measures, I see this directive as essential in increasing the confidence of European citizens in the work that law enforcement agencies carry out.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is only through applying the highest standards to policing and justice that we create a democracy which has the faith and trust of all its citizens. Therefore I hope this directive achieves two main goals: that of protecting civil liberties and lives, but also that of creating mechanisms which allow for the safe exchange of law enforcement data. In order to address the needs of such a system, I believe that a common-sense approach is the best way forward. But certainly I would stress to other Members of this House that this directive cannot be a solution for everything and every other law enforcement measure, current or future. We must lose no time in pressing forward with our work and it is our duty to protect European citizens as a result.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament’s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council’s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last!</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to refer again to two main points. Firstly, I would like to reconfirm that, for the Commission, progress on this very important issue means that we are going to negotiate both the regulation and the directive as a package. We really mean it. We have gone through two pieces of legislation, in spite of Parliament’s request, but now we have to focus on the procedure. I would like to confirm to everybody that we are going to insist on that. We are going to negotiate both pieces of legislation as a package.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I would like to stress is that we are going to do our best in order to ensure that the new legislation – the new post-Lisbon legislation on data protection – will be taken into account in terms of all the agreements and proposals that have some relevance to this data protection issue. I think that everybody here understands that this is a major issue, because it refers to human rights; it refers to the basic principles set out in the treaties which, in one way or another, have to guide our decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that an impasse has been reached. We would like to overcome it. I would like to say that the Commission is here and that it is really very willing to cooperate in order to overcome the difficulties both with the Council and with Parliament.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the multiannual plan for conserving Baltic salmon is a vital part of the management of marine resources in the context of the common fisheries policy reform. I must mention the role played by multiannual management plans and the impasse that has been reached with the Council, which is blocking their implementation. The proposal for a Regulation sets out comprehensive provisions for the protection of Baltic salmon, covering new areas and issues previously outside the scope of the common fisheries policy. I would like to stress that wide-ranging consultations have been held with stakeholders. Owing to time constraints, I shall concentrate on just a few.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the main issues covered in the report is recreational fishing, which, to date, has not been regulated, but which has a significant impact on the level of stocks. The lack of regulation has led to the uncontrolled development of recreational fishing in some countries; as a result of the introduction of specific names for the vessels involved, such as ‘service vessel’, it is not covered by controls, leading to an increase in unreported catches of Baltic salmon. In some cases, advanced fishing gear, such as towed nets, is used for recreational fishing. Member States have not complied with the obligation to provide relevant information about catches, meaning that the state of Baltic salmon stocks has not been correctly assessed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second issue not covered by existing provisions is the impact of predators on Baltic salmon stock. This is down to a lack of published material and reliable research describing the interrelation between predators and the level of salmon stock. The report indicates the type of research that should be carried out to determine this relationship and to make an accurate assessment of stock levels.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another important issue is the reproduction of Baltic salmon. The salmon population is currently declining and the proposal to impose strict limits on stocking is not a good solution, as it could lead to a further reduction in stocks. We need to maintain flexibility with regard to stocking, which should be adjusted in accordance with the stock levels at any given time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the common fisheries policy has not had the best record to date – its implementation has been at the expense of the environment and fish stocks, along with fishermen and coastal communities. The multiannual plans for this species and, most importantly, the new common fisheries policy must provide a way out of the present, deeply unfavourable situation. It is only the only way to emerge from the crisis and should be accepted by the Commission, Council and Parliament. Only then we will come through this and be able to make changes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would now like to know whether the Council will allow us to continue under the ordinary legislative procedure, or whether the current obstacles it has placed in Parliament’s way in the form of individual agreements will remain standing. Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to put that question, as the Council has probably already taken that decision and is simply not here to give an answer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Technical conservation measures are rules which our fishermen throughout the Union must follow on a daily basis when undertaking a fishing expedition. The purpose of imposing these measures or rules on our fishermen is very simple: it is to lay down how and where fishing activity should be carried out and to ensure that it is done in a sustainable manner. Ultimately, these measures are designed to ensure that our fish stocks are exploited in a sustainable way and that the eco-systems in which the fish live are well maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in order for these measures to work effectively and to deliver on stated objectives, these measures must be formulated and designed in tune with the evolving nature of fisheries management and, importantly, must be based on scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following my appointment as rapporteur by the Committee on Fisheries, I prepared my draft report under time constraints, bearing in mind that the Commission proposal was published in late June and the existing transitional measures expire on 31 December next. There were limited opportunities to fully debate the report in committee, which was unfortunate. I am therefore very grateful for the close collaboration and support I received from the shadow rapporteurs and, indeed, the entire committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report approved by the committee on 10 October included several key changes which specifically amended poorly conceived – and I believe inappropriate – technical measures. These amendments are fully justified and supported by clear scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I then received a mandate from the committee to negotiate with the Council Presidency. The trialogue negotiations concluded following an informal exchange when the trialogue went into recess. After the trialogue meeting, a misunderstanding developed concerning the agreement. The shadows met and a joint response by the shadows was sent to the Presidency, in which we outlined our red-lined, but reasonable, areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that we now have an agreement in place which serves the best interests of our fishermen, coastal communities, sustainable fisheries and the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The majority of the amendments contained in the agreement relate to the ICES area VIa, which is located on the north-west coast of Scotland and the north-west coast of Ireland where, in 2009, a cod recovery plan was introduced. Regrettably, the measures for cod recovery have caused major difficulties for fishermen off the coast of my own country by stopping traditional fisheries which, although they do not target cod, have of course suffered as a result of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to take this opportunity to outline several key aspects of the agreement. The agreement permits the use of gill nets and tangle nets south of 59° north within the defined area for cod recovery. The gear type is both eco-friendly and sustainable, and will not target cod in the defined area. This means that small inshore and island fishermen from the north-west will no longer have to steam 50 miles into treacherous Atlantic waters in small vessels. The fishermen will be able to target lesser spotted dogfish and haddock with gill and tangle nets within three miles of the coastline for ten days per month. Lesser spotted dogfish are not caught for human consumption, but can be used as bait for lobster and crab pots. The agreement removed the by-catch provision for haddock and whiting, which is causing a major discarding problem. It will now once again be possible to have targeted fishery for these three species.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement also ensures that non-Irish boats will be prevented from fishing in the Greencastle Box, which is closed from October to March each year. I have a few other points to make but will take the opportunity to do so later in the debate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, this report is not about finning. Finning is an abominable practice involving catching sharks in order to remove their fins and discard the rest of their bodies, and has been prohibited in the European Union since 2003. The Commission proposal is to end the derogation from the ban, not on finning, but on the removal of fins on board, which is currently allowed under a special permit, with the vessel owner having to keep, offload and market all parts of the captured animal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Vessel owners want to continue removing fins on board. Why? Once the fins have been removed, the fins and bodies can be stored separately, which saves space in the hold and allows the duration of each trip and the available fishing time to be increased. This therefore reduces the number of returns to port, which saves fuel and reduces polluting emissions. It also avoids the partial thawing of sharks on land in order to separate the fins from the bodies, which go to different markets, and their subsequent refreezing. This therefore preserves the quality of the fish, protects consumer health and maintains the value of the catch.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These were legitimate arguments in the Commission’s view in 2003. What has changed? Is it because the Commission has remembered to move forward with this initiative? Is it because the European fleet is practising finning? No! In 2005 and 2006 the Commission and Parliament confirmed that finning did not exist, and now, having been frequently urged to present evidence of finning, neither the Commission nor the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can do so.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At a workshop in May, the Shark Alliance representative publicly confirmed that the European fleet was not practising finning. So is it because the species that the European fleet catches are at risk? No! Around 90 % of the European catch is blue shark, which is a species with unparalleled biological productivity. The Commission has said that the reason is to end finning. It is therefore deliberately causing confusion in the minds of the public. At the same time, having been urged to justify this approach, the Commission has eventually said that it has suspicions, and it has the audacity to try and legislate based on suspicions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite the aberration of this position and the serious precedent that it would set, I tried to table proposals responding to all the concerns raised. If there are suspicions that finning is occurring, then we need to reinforce controls. I proposed the obligation to simultaneously land fins and bodies at all ports and the hiring, by vessel owners, of an independent body to check landings at ports where there is no permanent control.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the problem is the derogation, then we should limit it. I proposed that the derogation should apply only to freezer vessels, to the exclusion of wet fish vessels. If the concern is about shark stocks, then we should arrange to obtain scientific data. I proposed the bases for a shark action plan, with the obligation for the extensive collection of data on all species caught.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission said no to everything.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Meanwhile, in its strange determination to move forward with this proposal, it has forgotten to assess the socioeconomic impacts. However, the sector has assessed these impacts, and estimates, on a conservative basis, that the Iberian fleet will suffer a loss of EUR 14 million per year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commissioner’s proposal is unjustified and harmful. All my proposals fully respond to all the suspicions and concerns.</p>
      <p sl="pt">So why will these proposals not be unanimously adopted, and instead be rejected tomorrow by Parliament? Basically, I vehemently denounce the campaign of disinformation instigated by the Commission and actively pursued by the NGOs, which, in this specific case, have forgotten the nobility of their citizenship mission and have resorted to half-truths leading to false conclusions, explicit lies, and pressure via constant emails and circulars. They have also engaged in political terrorism, involving the persecutory identification of those who think differently and their personal defamation on social networks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Pressure from the NGOs and lack of national interest in fishing will cause many MEPs to opt for the comfort vote. We will all end up losing in that case. On the eve of the common fisheries policy reform, which will inevitably lead to significant economic and social costs, the fleet will suffer further harm. The Commissioner is deluding herself, believing that reforms can be implemented against the sector, which sees her as a second Environment Commissioner and which sees itself as an orphan, fighting for the future using every available means. The NGOs that should be protecting sharks will lose out, because they will destroy the current excellent relationship between vessel owners and scientists, and they will prevent the extensive collection of data and an action plan for sharks. The MEPs who vote for comfort will increasingly become hostage to the NGOs. I am sorry for everyone.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, this report on small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing was needed for two reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First, while it is generally agreed that the current common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a disaster, we cannot forget that this disaster is now being felt particularly keenly by the weakest segments of the fleet, by small-scale fishing and by the coastal communities that depend on this fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Second, the European Commission’s proposals to reform the CFP not only fail to solve these problems, but contain new elements of concern and threats to the future of small-scale fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the one hand, this report has sought to suggest a comprehensive approach to the CFP reform which is more favourable to small-scale fishing, and to take better account of the latter’s problems and also its potential, so that it can be utilised as fully as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, it makes specific and wide-ranging proposals to support small-scale fishing. Please allow me to highlight certain points of the report and some of its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Defence of meaningful decentralisation of fisheries management. Local management putting an end to the centralised management that has prevailed over the last 30 years, with the results of which we are all aware. Rejection of a single management model for all Member States, such as transferable fishing concessions. Increased Community cofinancing for gathering, processing and distributing biological data. Defence of positive discrimination of sectors and operators that use more selective fishing techniques and gear with less impact on resources and the marine environment, and which bring more benefit to the communities of which they are part in terms of generating jobs and the quality of those jobs. Need for a financial instrument for the outermost regions, which retains the principle of greater support. Also, financing of actions by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. These actions should be in the following areas, among others: improving safety and working conditions on board, improving catch preservation, and making vessels more energy efficient; promoting young people’s increased involvement in the sector’s activities and keeping them involved; support for the construction of infrastructure, such as specialised fishing ports and specific facilities for the landing, storage and sale of fishery products; support for associations, organisations and cooperatives of the sector’s professionals; and enhancing women’s role in fishing and valuing activities carried out on land.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Further proposals include: creating support mechanisms for emergencies, such as natural or man-made disasters, fishing stoppages imposed by plans for restoring stocks, or sudden increases in fuel prices; introducing financial compensation during biological rest periods; possibility of areas reserved exclusively for small-scale fishing; defence of still-existing public market regulation instruments; defence of mechanisms enabling fair and adequate distribution of value added along the sector’s value chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are some of the proposals in this report, and in fact some of the most important, for which I request your support. Some of them correct serious shortcomings in the Commission proposal. Pompous proclamations in defence of small-scale fishing are not enough. These proclamations need to be translated into concrete commitments of support for the measures needed to help solve the serious problems that are currently affecting small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the rapporteur on the international dimension of the common fisheries policy reform, I am quite proud today to say that ‘we have actually done it’!</p>
      <p sl="en">In the almost unanimous vote in the Committee on Fisheries, colleagues supported, and to a large extent improved, my draft report, so that it now clearly sets out the future principles for the EU external fishing fleet and how it can be sustainable in all its activities. It shows how the EU can become a leader by setting an example of responsible behaviour by a long-distance fishing nation, worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have achieved is quite remarkable. We reached a consensus that the EU should negotiate a fisheries agreement only where there is a clearly and scientifically proven surplus of fish that is not needed by local fishermen or people in the region. Of course, the fish stocks must also be in good condition. We agreed that the same rules – for instance, on discarding fish – should apply to EU vessels whether they are operating inside or outside the Union. We also agreed to introduce a human rights clause into fisheries agreements so that, if there is a serious violation of human rights in a third country, the protocols shall be suspended. We stated the need to decouple access fees from the money for so-called sectoral support in a clear way, so that poor countries should not be tempted to sell more fish in order to get more development aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Widespread support was also shown for the concept of regional agreements. The EU should not use its strength to negotiate agreements with countries in developing parts of the world one by one, but rather should encourage regional cooperation, which would lead to better management of fishery resources and transparency on total catches. We also recognise that the EU and its Member States have responsibilities in relation to the many private operators owned by EU interests, but often flying other flags, that are fishing all over the world. The committee also recognised our heavy responsibility as the greatest fish consumer market in the world, importing and eating 11 % of all the world’s catches in terms of volume.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to hide the fact that there is some controversial content in the report and that the biggest group in Parliament is still trying to get these things out of tomorrow’s vote – the anti-flag hopping clause, for example, the exclusivity clause and the statement that vessel owners should pay a considerable market-based share of the access fees.</p>
      <p sl="en">I regret this and I really hope that those – even in the PPE Group – who want to see the EU leading by example on issues relating to environmental sustainability, fair trade and respect for human rights, will not try to delete the paragraphs in question. One paragraph that I would like to emphasise is paragraph 7, which is about greater coordination inside the Commission and among Member States. That is really necessary if we are to achieve policy coherence on development, in accordance with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. We cannot have the EU negotiating a fisheries agreement and using development aid and trade agreements as a means of pressure to push through access to fishing grounds in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we have a great report here that can not only change the impact of the EU on the world’s oceans, but could also change how all distance-fishing nations behave. If we can show that the EU is willing to change, poor countries will have an easier time stipulating conditions for other distance-fishing nations. With this report we have started a race to the top in terms of good standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the assistants and advisers who helped with the report. We have the promise here of a great success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to thank all rapporteurs for their reports and not only the rapporteurs of course, but also the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Fisheries as a whole. It is obvious that a lot of work has been done here on very important issues and I am very happy to see that the fisheries policy draws the attention of more and more Members of this House. I do not have the time unfortunately to refer to all the issues raised by the rapporteur, so let me focus on some points.</p>
      <p sl="en">My first point concerns the multiannual plan for the Baltic salmon stock. Of course, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gróbarczyk, and I would like to say that we welcome Parliament’s endorsement that this stock should be managed according to the principle of maximum sustainable yield. It seems very easy now to refer to maximum sustainable yield, but I would like to remind all of you that it was not like this years ago; we have made progress here and we have done this together. I also welcome the ideas mentioned by the rapporteur that would increase the protection of the stocks like higher smolt production targets in rivers. This is very, very encouraging and we have to work together to see this excellent work implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the proposal on transitional technical measures: I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for his work but I would also like to underline that he has made a tremendous effort to make this agreement possible in time. This is very important considering the time constraints he had to face. I would like to say that the discontinuation of these measures (even temporarily) would have negative consequences for the conservation of some stocks and for vulnerable marine habitats, so I am very pleased that agreement was found on this proposal. Difficult and technical issues were handled by all of you and I think that we have achieved a high-level of conservation for these stocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me move now to the shark finning proposal; I think that we all agree – we have to agree, after all, because this is the reality – that we have to eradicate the horrendous practice of shark finning and protect sharks better. We need to do that one way or another, but we really need to do that. Our current rules allow shark fins to be removed on board and these rules are very difficult to control in practice. We cannot have a civil servant on every boat; this is impossible. Even if we wanted it, it would be impossible. So these rules do not provide sufficient safeguards to avoid the removal of fins and carcasses being discarded. I believe that rules that cannot be controlled in practice are just not good enough. It is therefore essential that all sharks are landed with their fins still attached, without any derogations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind you that many important shark fishing nations have already adopted fins-attached laws. We are not the first here. We are the followers rather, and their fishermen, the other nations’ fishermen, have shown that this is possible, while remaining profitable. So we can also do it. Some European fleets have also voluntarily adopted a fins-attached practice without complaining about additional costs. Regional Fisheries Management Organisations are also moving towards fins-attached rules. So there is a general tendency here. I hope that this House will support the Commission to close any remaining loopholes in the rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now say a few words on a very important own-initiative report: the report about small-scale fisheries. Small-scale fisheries are extremely important in Union fisheries. I do not have the time to refer to figures but they are in the report one way or another. So I would like just to say that over three out of four European vessels are small-scale coastal vessels, generating jobs and income, and contributing to the social fabric of our coastal communities. So it is not only about money, it is also about the real life of coastal areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Small-scale fisheries are also likely to benefit the most from a reformed fisheries policy based on a clear and time-bound obligation to manage stocks at maximum sustainable levels and to eliminate discards. Why? Because these small-scale fisheries are the most vulnerable segments of our fisheries industry and if the fish are in good health, then the small-scale fisheries can take advantage of it. They are also likely to benefit from the introduction of fish stock recovery areas in territorial waters. I am therefore looking favourably at the idea of fish stock recovery areas as a conservation tool. Small-scale fisheries can also take advantage of these, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our reform proposals place a special emphasis on small-scale fleets: we relieve small vessels from administrative and unnecessary financial burden; we differentiate fleet capacity management; we provide specific support from our new financial instrument. I would like to thank Mr Ferreira for his report, which highlights many important elements and I would like to say that some of these elements are already there in our reform proposal, for example the better funding, for example, the market rules. Very important for small-scale fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful for your constructive contributions on the role of small-scale fishing in the future policy and I would like to underline that I really am trying, the Commission is trying, to change the pattern here and really help small vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but certainly not least, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lövin for her report on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. This is a very important issue. This is a part of the reform we are trying to introduce and I can say also that I am really proud that Parliament and the Fisheries Committee, and almost all of you, have supported it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is also important because it looks beyond the common fisheries policy into other policies, other areas that have an important impact on the sustainable management of international fisheries resources, such as trade and foreign policy. So, here about trade and foreign policy, there is a lot of work to be done with other services, with other committees, and I am very happy that we have gone through it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that Parliament shows broad support for bold external action for sustainable fisheries management worldwide. This will improve our standing as an important fishing and market entity for sound and efficient fisheries management. We need this worldwide image. European fisheries policy needs this new image. It will also strengthen our position in negotiations with third parties to move forward the sustainability agenda and the global fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, last week, the Commission initiated a procedure against eight countries for failing to address illegal fishing. I would like to thank Parliament for its support on this file. So we have to move to the international handling of this very important issue and we need the credentials, let me put it this way, we need the credentials of a new international aspect in our fisheries policy to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome that the report endorses the need for bilateral agreements; this is very important. We need the bilateral agreements and we need a new generation of new bilateral agreements that would lead to a stable and transparent framework for both our partners and our industry. In particular, I appreciate that Parliament supports our proposal that the European fishing industry should take over a more important financial share of the costs when acquiring access rights to non-EU fishing zones.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like once again to thank all the rapporteurs and the speakers for their contributions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us stop ‘finning’! We must put a stop to indiscriminate capture of sharks in order to remove their precious and much sought-after fins before throwing the huge shark bodies back into the sea. There must be an end to exemptions for special permits. This is what Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has asked for in its opinion, on which I acted as rapporteur, which despite some opposition from the Committee on Fisheries, will be approved in full by this House tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union, in line with the view of the scientific world, decided to outlaw finning in 2003, but the exemptions allowed by the current legislation make it impossible to combat a phenomenon that poses a serious threat to the survival of this particularly vulnerable species. There is no other way to go: only by making it mandatory for fins to be landed still naturally attached to the body can a simple and effective control of the ban on on-board finning be achieved. Encouraging conservation of shark stocks will bring about genuinely sustainable fishing. I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, salmon are threatened, and the main threats to salmon are fishing and hydroelectric power. It is not seals and cormorants that eat up the majority of salmon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is important and I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has approved many of the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, particularly with regard to the 80 % target for reproduction capacity and more stringent, earlier regulation of recreational fishing, subsistence fishing and sport fishing, because these account for a significant proportion of the catches.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It will also be good for us to have an improved reporting system in general, but what I think is missing from the report by the Fisheries Committee is what we approved on the Environment Committee, namely to stop sea fishing, because it is not selective. It can happen that the few wild salmon required, which must go back to the area where they have to spawn, can be caught by accident, so the threat is serious.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Otherwise, I welcome the motion. This could be the start of the salmon’s return to recovery, and it is not only good for the environment; it is an economic gain for many interested parties in society and it generates thousands of jobs.</p>

I likewise agree with your idea that small-scale fishing is in a precarious situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I come from a shellfishing country, from a fishing nation, which is therefore extremely vulnerable and must be specifically protected. We also need a new definition of artisanal fishing as the current definition is archaic.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I have drafted an opinion for Mr Ferreira’s report on small-scale and artisanal fisheries. There are still too many legal and social obstacles preventing women’s full participation at all levels in the fisheries sector. Women work on fishing boats and are involved at all levels of the production chain: in fish capture, in breeding and harvesting in aquaculture, and in processing and placing on the market; they are boat-owners; they organise fishing activities and provide support to the fishermen at sea.</p>
      <p sl="it">The work of women in the fisheries sector needs to be made more visible, especially in the artisanal sector, since 85 % of women active in this sector feel they are discriminated against. This is seen as an exclusively male sector: there are obstacles to women’s advancement and the support structures available are inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am pleased that Mr Ferreira has given due attention to this opinion and that Mr Damanaki has underlined the importance of cooperation between the Committee on Fisheries and the other parliamentary committees. I would therefore like to underline some of the priority actions to be taken at EU and Member State level. What is most important is the protection of the legal and social status of women working in the sector so as to ensure equal wages, in other words safeguarding social and economic rights. Above all insurance must be provided for covering risks at sea. Much has been done, but much more can be done.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, these are tough times for the European fisheries sector. The serious economic crisis that is devastating Europe, the scarcity of marine resources needed to allow the fleets to be economically viable and the negotiations on agreements that are often unacceptable because of their detrimental interests, mean that the sector is looking towards the future with some concern. If we add to that the shameful obstruction of the multiannual plans by the Council, which is also seeking pretexts for reneging on the Treaty itself – something that we absolutely will not stand for – we end up with a panorama that is pretty bleak.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are discussing different aspects of great importance, including the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, which enables the EU fleet to fish in the high seas and in third-country waters, and through which the European Union also exports principles of good governance, leading the fight for sustainability, ensuring food security in the least-developed countries and eradicating illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">In all, 60 % of the fish consumed in the European Union comes from third-country imports and, as a consequence, one of the objectives of the external dimension of this policy must be to ensure the continuity of the economically viable high-sea fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">We do not agree that the fisheries agreements should entail an exclusivity clause that prevents the European fleet from fishing in third-country waters when the European Union has failed to conclude a new protocol and we have several examples of that.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nor do we agree that there should be penalties for the temporary reflagging of EU vessels when they change their flag so that they can access third-country waters – even if those countries comply with all of the international regulations – where no agreement on access to resources has been reached. Similarly, we do not agree with the fact that the fishing authorisation fees that shipowners have to pay to access the fishery resources of a third country can triple on occasion without a cost-benefit analysis having been carried out.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my opinion, it is pointless to propose keeping fish stocks above, rather than at, maximum sustainable yield, as this would reduce fishing opportunities by more than is necessary. For these and other reasons, our group has tabled an alternative motion for a resolution, which, in our opinion, improves the rapporteur’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="es">In conclusion, Commissioner – and I see that the Council is absent once again – fisheries is such an important sector that it is crucial for the three institutions to be able to reach agreement and work towards the same goal. Parliament certainly will.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, on the whole I am very satisfied indeed with the broad agreement in which this report has resulted. It is a big step towards more careful, sustainable fisheries. The report is expressive of the fact that a large majority of the Committee supports long-overdue improved checks on salmon fishing in the Baltic Sea. With this report, we are supporting the Commission’s proposal to manage all salmon fishing, including recreational and non-commercial fishing. We are doing this because a lack of control over this type of fishery has contributed to the fact that salmon has been over-fished.</p>
      <p sl="da">There have been some critics throughout the negotiation process who think that the implementation of a broad control like this is too comprehensive. I do not think it is. We must, of course, be aware of it, but I think that, in collaboration with the business community, recreational fishermen, the Commission and the Member States, we can find some intelligent solutions. For example, there is a whole new world of smartphones and internet-based reporting.</p>
      <p sl="da">Illegal salmon fishing is a very big problem, and it will only be stopped if the Member States take the controls seriously and the business community does not cheat. Those who cheat must take responsibility so that there is no cheating with the labelling of trout and salmon. It undermines the whole endeavour to re-establish the salmon stocks.</p>
      <p sl="da">It must be said that the report is a long-awaited one, and I will therefore urge the Council to enter into constructive negotiations on this so that we can achieve the necessary management of all salmon fishing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wonder who it was who first stood over a shark on the deck of their vessel and stuck a knife deep into it and hacked off its fin, cutting deeply into it, and then told his colleagues to help him throw it overboard back into the sea, where it could swim, sink and starve or just bleed to death. Fishing is an inherently cruel activity I suppose but, even by its standards, shark finning is an unpleasant practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">We thought we had dealt with the problem of shark finning some years ago, but of course we left loopholes, and now the Commission has come back and is closing those loopholes, and I hope we will end it once and for all. But that should be seen as a first step, because we know from the figures that shark species across the planet have experienced massive declines in the last few years. This is a creature that has been on the planet for hundreds of millions of years – longer than mankind. I would be very sorry if we saw the elimination of entire species during the course of our own lifetimes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will just turn to the issue of small-scale fisheries. We know that small-scale fisheries, by and large, generally employ more people in the fishing sector as a whole than the large-scale fishing that generates so much income. We also know that, by and large, it causes the least environmental damage. Yet on numerous occasions I hear people in my own country and elsewhere saying that it is all the fault of Brussels, and that we should be helping small-scale fishermen, giving them a bigger share of the catch and not penalising them. They ask why we are being so bad and so cruel to the small-scale fisherman. Yet, of course, it is not Brussels, and it is not the Commission. The Commission – the European Union – shares out the fishing opportunities to Member States. It is the Member States that decide whether the big vessels or the small vessels get it. Maybe some of the critics should spend less time criticising Brussels and more time criticising their own national capitals.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, sharks have been in our seas and oceans for more than 400 million years, but that may change because 100 million sharks are slaughtered every year for their fins.</p>
      <p sl="es">The worst part of all this is the removal of fins, or finning, a cruel practice indeed, which is thus banned almost everywhere in the world, including the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the existing European Regulation contains a number of gaps that needed to be filled. This was a necessary, reasonable and, a priori, simple process. It involved requiring all sharks to be landed with their fins naturally attached to their body.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has taken a great deal of effort to get to this point, too much effort, in fact, and I really do not understand why; nor do thousands of citizens. When the European Commission did the only sensible thing it could and did away with all of the exemptions and special permits that benefited the Spanish and Portuguese fleets in particular, our role, as Parliament, should have been simply to support and welcome that proposal.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all congratulate Mr Ferreira on his important report on the small-scale fleet because not only is the artisanal fleet in EU waters by far the largest sector, representing over 80 % of the EU fleet by vessel number, with tens of thousands of fishermen, supporting thousands of coastal communities across the EU, but it is also a low impact sustainable fishery, matching all of the criteria that we are demanding as legislators.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the livelihoods of our artisanal fishermen are under threat. Changing marine ecosystems, fishing pressure from the larger, over ten-metre, vessels and human pressure on coastal areas are all contributing to a downward spiral for local fishermen, who for centuries have supplied fresh, high-quality, diverse, locally caught fish and shellfish to the market. We have an opportunity within the current CFP reform to correct this negative trend. Ever since the CFP was first introduced, there has been discrimination against the artisanal sector. The majority of fishing quotas have been allocated to large-scale fishing operations across the EU, leading to the situation where over 60 % of fish stocks in European waters are now fished beyond sustainable limits.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now of course we need to support the large-scale fleet because we are only 40 % self-sufficient in marine produce in Europe and we are increasingly dependent on imports of fish products from countries outside the EU, but the artisanal fleet have a key role to play in all of this. One of our core objectives must be to grant the right to fish to those who fish sustainably. That means reducing overcapacity, ending harmful subsidies and destructive practices, and restoring our seas to full health.</p>
      <p sl="en">These should be our guiding principles throughout the discussions on the CFP reform.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to say a word of praise for the rapporteurs’ work. I wholeheartedly endorse their concerns and also the proposals they set out in their reports. I also commend the work of the Commissioner, Ms Damanaki, who stood by the Committee on Fisheries throughout its work. As time is limited, I shall focus on the report by Mr Ferreira on the very important role of small-scale fishing.</p>
      <p sl="el">The discussion of this report comes at a crucial time, because we are now laying down the common fisheries policy which will form the basis for fisheries over the next ten years. Small-scale fishing requires special attention and management, both under the common fisheries policy and in terms of adequate funding from the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Small-scale fisheries employ 80 % of the fishing fleet in the European Union. Artisanal fishing, because of its structural weaknesses, is more exposed to external shocks. The economic crisis, the rise in the price of oil, market dysfunctions and obstacles to the flow of the product are some of the problems affecting the sector which must be solved by best practice. The rapporteur’s proposals are quite positive. However, the main problem, as representatives of the sector emphasise, is the problem of overfishing of stock: 80 % of the fish stock in the Mediterranean is being over-fished without adequate care taken to regenerate it, and the Mediterranean Fisheries Regulation is being infringed every day. I believe the supervision of enforcement and Member States’ compliance with the existing legislation is a key issue. The future of fisheries in Europe lies in coastal fishing activity, which is sustainable, has low impact on the marine environment, and is a lever for growth and job creation in Europe. The small-scale fishing sector has huge advantages which must be exploited.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I must speak briefly on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In my final speech I will have the opportunity to return to small-scale fishing and will, at that point, give Mr Davies a piece of news, which is that the management of marine living resources is an exclusive competence of the European Union. It is not even a competence shared with the Member States. However, I will return to that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the external dimension of the CFP, the current policy also needs substantial changes to its external aspect. Far-reaching amendments are needed in the current fisheries agreements with third countries. The rapporteur has suggested some of these amendments, which we appreciate. Many of the objectives of the fisheries partnership agreements have not been achieved. These agreements have in general boiled down to the transfer of funds to developing countries and exchanges in the exploitation of their fish resources. This is a restrictive view, which we deplore and which is contrary to the spirit and objectives of these agreements. Fisheries cooperation should promote, in the medium term, the exploitation by developing countries of their own resources, both for internal consumption and for export, thus increasing the proportion of the wealth generated that remains in the country.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would underline once again the importance of drawing up frameworks with goals, actions and indicators allowing the application of fisheries agreements to be monitored in a spirit of partnership. This monitoring should include the adoption of corrective procedures, to be coordinated with the third country whenever a failure to meet the set objectives is discovered.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must say one final word on the proposal for a regulation on technical measures. In this respect, I want to thank the rapporteur for his readiness to accept the amendment that we tabled. The original regulation provided for grievous measures that would have discriminated against the Portuguese anglerfish fleet and that lacked any scientific basis. We therefore appreciate the fact that this amendment could be made.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this joint debate covers four important components of fisheries policy, and at the outset I would like to applaud the rapporteurs for their hard work in moving these matters through the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new common fisheries policy – when it arrives – will have a bearing on every one of the subjects. A discard ban, maximum sustainable yield and regionalisation are all issues that have come to the fore as the reform has progressed. Coming from Northern Ireland, I want to highlight the importance of the small-scale fleet and the work that the rapporteur has done on this particular report.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I want to pose what is for me a very important question for the Commissioner and for colleagues here tonight. I want to focus on an aspect of the reform that I think is absolutely pivotal to a successful reform, and that is the issue of regionalisation. We all agree that regionalisation is important. It is important for streamlining bureaucracy and management, the more efficient protection of fish stocks, and the working together of the scientific community and the catching sector, be it in the Baltic Sea, with shark finning or with queen scallop fishing, as in Mr Gallagher’s report.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I would like to see is this Parliament reflecting, in the weeks ahead, on what it really wants from EU fisheries policy. It seems to me that there is a tendency for us to simply want to secure a power base for various EU institutions, rather than what I would like to see as a pragmatic approach to fisheries policy that will benefit fish stocks, those who depend upon them in the catching sector and those who depend upon them for food and sustenance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, as the rapporteur for the situation of wild salmon in the Baltic, I would like to focus on this specific part of our debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">The stock is indeed in a parlous state. The reduction in the fishing quota, which has been undertaken by scientists together with the Regional Advisory Council (RAC) according to a specific formula, is drastic, amounting to almost 80 %. This fishing quota is no longer stated in tonnes but in individual units. When we discuss the fishing mortality rate, we must of course consider all the relevant aspects. It is essential to include tourist and leisure fishing catches of Baltic salmon and subject to them to the same controls as professional fishing. That is beyond question. If we intend to introduce logbooks for all fishing vessels of more than 12 metres in length, this must also apply across the board.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baltic salmon, whose main habitat is found in the Gulf of Bothnia and the central basin of the Baltic Sea, must of course also be able to reach its spawning areas. To that end, it must migrate upstream, along the rivers, mainly in Sweden. Before it reaches the mouth of the river, it must evade its natural enemies. These are the seals, the grey seals, large numbers of which lie in wait for their prey. Any salmon that survives then swims upstream, but here, there are the sports anglers and the recreational fishermen and then the hydropower plants which have already been mentioned. Only then do they reach their spawning areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must keep all of this in mind, for this is part of a sustainable fishery. We must also adopt countermeasures and a management plan in order to replenish the stocks with higher smolt production, for salmon is not only a culinary delicacy; it is also a species which must survive. We want to see it surviving in the Baltic.</p>
      <p sl="de">MSY means ‘maximum sustainable yield’, and based on the scientific findings and together with the RAC, this is already being practised. However, all the relevant stakeholders should participate in the Regional Advisory Councils, and that includes the NGOs. The North Sea Regional Advisory Council visited us recently and informed us that the NGOs have never once attended one of their meetings. I urge them to participate and to contribute to the development of our Common Fisheries Policy, which is a major responsibility for us as Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, tonight we are discussing several important reports. I would like to start with my own home waters, the Baltic Sea, and the management plan for Baltic Sea salmon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, the report gives us minimum dimensions for salmon and sea trout. Hopefully, this will effectively close the loopholes that have been found and which have made it possible to fish for salmon in excess of the quotas and enter the catch as sea trout instead of salmon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, we want the existing compensatory restocking to be phased out in the long term, by producing an inventory of rivers and a management plan with regard to how the local salmon population can be restored.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, with the help of actively involved professional fishermen, sport fishermen and nature-conservation organisations, we will ensure that there is greater practical knowledge involved in this context, from the Baltic Sea fisheries policy to the external dimension of this report. I have three points to add.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, it is important that we create a fair system of rules and put a stop to the systematic change of flags that we see today. The fishing boats that switch their flags from the EU to countries that offer flags of convenience must not be allowed back onto the EU register so that they can subsequently receive financial subsidies</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, tomorrow I will be voting to strengthen the ban on shark finning and to firmly close such loopholes as still exist, for all the reasons that the Commissioner outlined in her comments. Tomorrow I will be voting in favour of the External Dimension Report by my Group colleague, Ms Lövin, which is extremely well focused on that subject. Tomorrow I will also be supporting the Gallagher and Ferreira reports, both of which draw particular attention to lessons we can learn as we grapple with the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP).</p>
      <p sl="en">The Gallagher report deals with some highly complex technical measures which have been of great frustration to fishers in Scotland and Ireland, amongst other places – a great frustration because technical measures have been in place which have had inappropriate catch-composition rules for too long, and instead of conserving resources have actually directly caused massive discards of haddock. I am glad that at last we are finding a way, hopefully, to get out of that ridiculous situation. The point here which is relevant to CFP reform is that decisions on the detail of technical measures are surely best made by the fishing nations themselves, through decentralised decision-making. I hope that will be taken on board in a new CFP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Ferreira rightly points out that there are very diverse ranges of types of fishery – types of boats, types of geography, types of catches – and therefore that centralised control is not the best way to manage these resources for the benefit of consumers and communities. Again, I hope that decentralisation, rather than such things as mandatory closed areas, will be the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, since we have five reports before us, I would like tonight to focus on the removal of shark fins, as have a large number of my colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="da">One of the key principles of the fisheries reform is that we must stop discarding fish. This principle must naturally also apply to sharks. If sharks must be caught at all, the whole animal must be landed. This means that fins must not be removed from the body at sea, as others have said today, and I suppose that shark meat can of course be used for many things, including animal feed, fish meal and many other things. The legislation is too weak on this point. It is therefore good that the Commission wants to close the loopholes in the law. Thank you, Commissioner!</p>
      <p sl="da">The Council will support the motion, and naturally so should we. It would be unbelievably irritating if Parliament chose to drag the motion in the wrong direction. We must do something completely right for once. The aim of the amendment is, among other things, to stop sharks from being mistreated. We must not catch sharks for the sake of their fins any more than we must kill elephants for the sake of their tusks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, shark finning is an appalling practice that has been allowed to continue, despite a ban in 2003, through loopholes and special provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the UK has outlawed shark finning, special fishing permits are still being granted by some Member States. As a result, Europe ranks second in the world as a producer of shark products, after Indonesia. Spain issued 1 266 permits between 2004 and 2010, and Portugal 145.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shark fins are the most valuable part of the catch and can reach up to USD 90 per kilo in Asia. As a result, fishermen hack the fins from the sharks to bypass landing the catch at one port, making controls impossible to enforce and enabling this lucrative trade to continue unrestricted.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Wales, the fleet of almost 500 boats operating off the coastline is largely Spanish-owned and exports 90 % of its catch to China and Japan. Despite a UK blanket ban, there is nothing we can do to prevent shark finning happening on foreign vessels just off our shores.</p>
      <p sl="en">I stand by the belief that fishing rights should be controlled by domestic governments, but in the meantime, by pushing for an amendment stating that the fin must be attached to the shark in a natural way on landing, we can work to ensure the abatement of this cruel and wasteful practice.</p>

However, I am aware that a shark thrown back into the sea is a dead shark. I am aware that the barbaric practice of finning has resulted in overfishing and that the European fleets are not innocent in all of this. Finally, I am aware that 73 species of shark are endangered and that they play an essential role in the food chain.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I too would like to comment on the shark issue. The rapporteur states in the report, quite rightly, that finning is unacceptable on social, economic and moral grounds. However, her attempt to defend the exemptions to the ban on onboard finning does not stand up to scrutiny. Exemptions are always problematical. They can be easily circumvented, as we know, and are difficult to monitor. Only a total ban on finning, as proposed by the Commission, can offer a remedy here and genuinely provide better protection for these creatures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The meeting of the Washington Convention will also be important for the protection of sharks. If the European Union is successful, on that occasion, in overcoming the blockade organised by or oriented towards Japan, I think this will be a major step forward in protecting shark populations. It is also essential to focus on consumers. Thanks to various campaigns in Hong Kong, which handles around 50 % of the world trade in shark fin, attitudes are starting to change and some restaurants and hotels are no longer serving shark fin. In my view, that is a good sign. There are also encouraging signs from Beijing, where one Member of Parliament is lobbying to ensure that shark is no longer served at official banquets. At least 95 % of shark fin is, after all, consumed in China.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am particularly pleased with the proposals in the Ferreira report, which are for the most part similar to my own. European fishing has a future and the common fisheries policy must support the investment in the sector. Fleet modernisation and renewal are essential to guarantee the competitiveness and sustainability of our fishing model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European fleet has an average age of 27, which causes significant problems in terms of environmental protection and safety on board. We must attend to this problem as a matter of urgency. What we must not do, of course, is increase the fishing capacity or the fishing effort, and I would stress that point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must renew the fleet at a constant capacity, or even a lower capacity, if necessary. We will, of course, have to lay down precise criteria for this renewal. That is why I am proposing giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts on these criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my firm opposition to transferable fishing concessions (TFC). This is a dangerous mechanism that would inevitably lead to the dismantling of our fishing model. However, we do need a fleet capacity management instrument because the capacity ceilings imposed on the Member States in the basic Regulation are inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you often ask me what I would propose instead of TFCs, and I will try to answer your question. As part of my report on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), I will soon table an amendment aimed at ensuring that Member States respect their capacity ceilings through ex-post conditionality. If a Member State does not respect its capacity ceiling after three years, the Commission would be able to suspend EMFF commitments and payments for that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is up to the Member States to measure and control their capacity, with all of the rigour this requires.

These objectives cannot be mere slogans, however. Consequently, the technical measures in the Gallagher report, despite being only transitional, highlight the difficulties involved in moving to practical cases, fishery by fishery, stock by stock.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Ferreira report on artisanal fishing rightly recognises that there is not one criterion, but a range of criteria, for defining artisanal fishing. The Gróbarczyk report highlights the lack of data. The Lövin report on the external dimension points out that we are evolving in a global context and looks at the conditions for the exploitation of resources outside European waters as well as the import conditions to ensure fair trade.

There must be greater controls to ensure that our contributions in third countries encourage industries with our values and practices. We also need a coherent and pragmatic European strategy, to ensure that predatory fleets do not fill the gaps we leave behind when certain fisheries agreements expire.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore support the proposals on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, but I also believe that there must be room in it for coastal and artisanal fishing, which is most integrated into its natural and social ecosystem. That sector offers high-quality products and should reap the benefits of its work at sea and on land.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are a number of basic conditions for maintaining the population and fishing activities in many coastal areas, including a flexible and realistic definition of artisanal fishing, a stronger role for the regions, and greater social awareness to enable recognition of work-related diseases affecting women working in auxiliary jobs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will use the brief time I have available to express my group’s support for the report by Mr Ferreira. In our opinion, it has at least two advantages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, it focuses on a vital fishing sector that is often overlooked and sacrificed: small-scale, artisanal and coastal fishing, which is the sector in which most European vessels and fishermen operate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, this report puts the problem of small-scale fishing at the heart of the reform of the common fisheries policy. If, as we hope, the new fisheries policy is based on sustainable fishing criteria, the interests of artisanal fishermen will be guaranteed and consolidated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will only be able to ensure the future of thousands of small-scale fishermen, and with them the global food supply to which they make a vital contribution, if we have a fisheries policy that is firmly focused on conserving marine resources, and protecting and renewing stocks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am also going to use my minute to address the issue of shark finning, at the risk of repetition.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is imperative that we use this opportunity to close the remaining loopholes in this regulation and ensure that the cruel and wasteful practice of finning is completely eradicated. Ensuring that all sharks caught in EU waters by EU vessels are landed with their fins naturally attached is by far the simplest way to ensure this enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UK, we have already taken steps to ensure that the wasteful practice of shark finning at sea cannot take place on UK-registered vessels, and we have been joined by many other countries around the world. It is time the EU enshrined this, for all vessels under EU flags.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘No derogations’ is the best way to ensure a complete end to this wasteful practice. ‘Fins naturally attached’ improves and simplifies enforcement and compliance-monitoring and reduces the risk of the regulation being circumvented.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the report we are voting tomorrow. I agree fully with what I have heard from all in the House on the practice of ‘finning’. In congratulating Mr Ferreira on his work, I would like to add some comments on artisanal fishery.</p>
      <p sl="it">The last common fisheries policy only increased the separation between the institutions regulating fishing and those directly participating in the activity, in other words fishermen. However, to date in Europe the absence of a real definition of artisanal fishing has worked against those who have always seen fishing as an activity rooted in the tradition of a specific place, its waters and its cuisine. This has led to the growing conviction that the line taken by the European Commission intends to make all European fishing conform to a large-scale industrial model, following only market logic and not listening to the arguments of thousands of fishermen who for two decades have been working according to rules for protecting the ecosystem, which I can only agree with, but which have done nothing to preserve the microeconomic working practices of artisanal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report sends a strong signal to the Commission, which should take practical steps to protect the fishing micro-economy. The report in fact underlines a series of benefits, such as for example an allocation to small-scale fishing from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Access to funds should favour projects offering integrated solutions that benefit coastal communities as a whole. Promotion of young people’s increased involvement in the sector’s activities is also essential; the committee has often discussed this question since otherwise, fishing will risk dying out not only due to lack of fishing areas and fish stocks, but also because young people will no longer become involved in the sector. This report represents the opportunity to provide training and incentives to those who are considering this sector as a career</p>

      <p sl="bg">As a shadow rapporteur on the external dimension, I would like to congratulate Ms Lövin on her excellent work on the report and the entire secretariat, who were very professional. The work on the report was very complicated as we had to get to the core of the interests of the Member States and the Community, of the European Union and third countries, of the neighbouring sea states, while strictly adhering to international agreements, observing competition boundaries and market regulation. We also had to get to the core of commercial interests and the development of the fisheries sector, while guaranteeing the sustainability of fish stocks and the observation of environmental standards, and establishing strict rules. The activity of the regional fisheries organisations was also covered and emphasis was put in creating such a body for the Black Sea. We worked hard and reached the best compromises.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Therefore, I cannot fathom why Mr Аdrover tabled a new, alternative motion, literally at the eleventh hour, thereby surprising all of the committee members, who had voted almost unanimously for Ms Lövin’s report.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I want to concentrate on Ms Patrão’s report on shark fishing, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her on her excellent work and her spirit of collaboration.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said that, there are not many others to be congratulated, particularly the European Commission, because this proposal is a clear demonstration of what should never happen in the fisheries sector. Its partisan approach and the clear lack of consensus contradict the principles of the next reform, especially the bottom-up decision-making process involving consultation – of both the sector involved and civil society – in order to reach a compromise.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, a compromise on measures that have such a serious impact on a fleet’s future cannot just be a compromise between you and the NGOs. You have positioned yourself exclusively on their side and that means that the Commission is working in the interests of one part of civil society, yet there is no compromise with those who are affected.</p>
      <p sl="es">I, personally, have been very much involved in this matter and have worked tirelessly with the sector to convince it of the need to relax its initial positions so that no one could object to the final proposals. I have done the same with the NGOs, but it has proved impossible because they knew that the Commission was on their side. Why, therefore, would they want to seek a compromise?</p>
      <p sl="es">In relation to what you said about the international dimension, Commissioner, I have just attended a meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICAAT), at which every single resolution on sharks was rejected, including one like the text that you are proposing: the debate on it lasted not even a minute and, indeed, the European Commission did not even say anything.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Commissioner, do you believe that under these circumstances it is necessary to condemn a fleet in the face of its competitors? Would it not have been much better to wait for ICAAT to take a decision?</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to ask you to state publicly here that no finning takes place in the European Union. This is because of the comments during the NGOs’ campaign of lies. I would ask you to state whether or not there is any finning in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Traditional fishing produces more jobs and less CO2 per kilo of catch than industrial fishing. The small-scale fishing lobby, however, is weaker. That is why we must be vigilant and ensure that it is not put at a disadvantage in the allocation of quotas, for example. We will also be voting tomorrow on Parliament’s position on the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is intended to form the basis for our future decisions, for example on fisheries agreements. I am pleased that with one exception, all groups were able to agree on a text.</p>
      <p sl="de">A minority has now drafted a resolution which I hope will be rejected by a majority of the House. The comments that have been made about shark-finning give me cause for optimism.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Gróbarczyk for his excellent work on the report on the multiannual plan for the Baltic salmon stock. However, it did not have the easiest of beginnings. Unfortunately, the series of solutions proposed by the Commission were, in many places, unworkable. In order to ensure that the proposal for a Regulation was comprehensive and could be fully implemented for the benefit of fish stocks and fishermen, a great deal of work was needed. The substance of the Commission proposal, for which we waited a long time, did not provide a basis for the constructive exchange of opinions, which was unfortunate, as this proposal for a Regulation will have a huge impact on the salmon fishing sector. Happily, we have managed to work together across political group lines to draft a good text and to reach an effective compromise, as a result of which no new amendments have been tabled during this part-session. I congratulate Mr Gróbarczyk on that achievement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to refer to a few issues. The most important for me is that of stocking. Fortunately, the sections portraying this practice in a very bad light have been removed. We should focus, above all, on sourcing better-quality and genetically safe material for stocking and on preventing inappropriate stocking. Only when poorly carried out does stocking have an adverse effect on the genetic diversity of Baltic salmon stocks. It should be stressed that, without restorative stocking, there would be no salmon at all in many rivers. The fact that 20 % of all landings will be inspected is also to be welcomed. I think that this provision, which is in line with Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, is a very good compromise. The need to include both commercial and recreational fisheries under the plan has been addressed by Mr Gróbarczyk and I welcome that. Once again, I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

Thus, in honour of sharks I am wearing a fin for the remainder of my speech.</p>
      <p sl="it">I want to support the position taken by Ms Lövin and oppose the Group of the European People’s Party’s alternative motion for a resolution. I think that this alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group, signed by the Chair, poses a very serious problem because it deletes an important part of this report involving the conclusion of fisheries agreements in the Mediterranean. Without fisheries agreements with other countries, our Mediterranean is condemned to certain death. Removing the possibility of conducting a fisheries foreign policy in the Mediterranean means killing the sea. I would therefore ask the Chair to withdraw this motion before tomorrow, and call on all Mediterranean MEPs to vote against it if the motion is not withdrawn.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishing is a vital sector in Europe. That is perfectly obvious from the five reports and the debate this evening. Major economic and ecological interests are involved.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As rapporteur on five future Structural Funds for the general regulation which covers the sea and the Fisheries Fund, I would also like to point out the opportunities we have to invest in an integrated approach for the coastal regions. It is the Ferreira report that draws attention to the small-scale fisheries, the artisan fishing operations. It is important to maintain them for the attractiveness of coastal areas and for maintaining a balance, including ecological balance, in these areas. In my country too, in the Netherlands, the shellfish and crustacean sector is small but vitally important. It is important, therefore, not to confine our attention to the large scale. New initiatives, such as aquaculture, can supplement the bigger operations. We can also make use of the Regional Development Fund in the coastal regions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Second, technology can help us. I will give you an example of a development in the Netherland – a young fisherman from Volendam won an prize for innovation with it – which enables by-catch to be flushed back into the sea alive. It can be used on a number of vessels in a number of sectors. A development like this really does help us make progress, and I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she will strenuously support innovations like this. The funds will allow this and I think that it would be a good contribution to the image of the sector.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I want to express my concern at this time because we have to reach an agreement on the reform of the common fisheries policy, and I specifically want to address those of who hold the majority in the Council and in this Parliament, that is, the conservatives.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we need a fair and balanced fisheries reform; a reform that respects fishery resources, social and economic sustainability, the environment and the marine environment; a reform that is fair to fishermen, who for centuries have used low-impact, selective fishing gear and who look after the sea because it has been, and continues to be, their main source of life. Some 80 % of the European fleet is involved in coastal, artisanal and inshore fishing. It is the lifeblood of entire regions, it shapes our culture and our gastronomy, it guarantees a fresh, high-quality produce and it generates a great deal of employment. It is therefore important to take that reality into account, promote training and integration for young people and ensure that women earn equal wages.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The Commissioner has made the point – which is true – that you cannot monitor all fishing vessels but, given that most of the damage is being done by large-scale vessels, would she not consider making resources available to monitor those vessels, because finning, mincing and flag hopping are all part and parcel of what many of the large-scale vessels do?

      <p sl="de">Firstly, as we all know, fishing is one of the oldest crafts practised by humankind. Even now, many forms of fishing are practised by small-scale and medium-sized operations and artisanal fishermen. We put SMEs at the heart of our policies in Europe and I think it is right that this report also focuses very strongly on their needs. That is my first comment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, with regard to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, fish is already an important source of protein in many countries; this applies particularly to developing countries and their populations. With a growing world population, it is important in future to ensure, to an even greater extent than before, that people who rely on local fish as a source of protein can actually catch fish off their own coasts and that only the surplus is available to European fishermen, for example, under fisheries agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final comment relates to shark finning. It is unacceptable, it is barbaric, and it should be banned. I think there is general agreement on that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, small-scale fishing deserves to be specially protected under the common fisheries policy, not only because it promotes socioeconomic cohesion and sustains many families, but also because it helps ensure the survival of these communities in coastal areas. Its economic and social sustainability should be an objective, with a tailored fishing regime that gives priority of access to resources, enables local management and protects the fishing rights from which fishing professionals in these communities benefit in response to transferable fishing rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The regime for access to waters is equally important to its sustainability, particularly in regions with marine bio-geographic basins, with limited continental shelves and scarce resources, concentrated around seamounts and fishing groups to which access must be protected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In a context of liberalisation and crisis, which is weighing heavy on the vulnerable regions, it must also be ensured that products originating from international trade meet the same requirements as EU products.</p>

      <p sl="en">I shall now make a few comments, firstly on the Baltic salmon proposal. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, which was recognised by all the speakers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just two clarifications: regarding the problem of predators – yes, I recognise that there is a problem; and yes, we are trying to find concrete data and figures about the size and severity of the problem. But at the end of the day, Mr Gróbarczyk, I would like to remind you and all the Members that this is a national competence. This is not a competence of the Commission. This is a competence that comes from the Environment Directive, and so it is a competence of the Member States. We are now trying to find out the impact – the result – of the action of these predators, but this is all we can do. I would just like to clarify this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards recreational fisheries – specifically salmon – a lot of the Members of this House have referred to this problem. Yes, there is a problem. We have some studies which have references saying that, for example, recreational fisheries in the Baltic take maybe 20 % of the whole salmon catch. Can you imagine 20 % only from recreation fisheries? But recreational fisheries are a competence of the Member States, so what we can do is to ensure that what recreational fisheries are doing is really recreational: catching fish for consumption and not for sale. However, the Member States have to cooperate on this, as we cannot touch these issues. I would like to give you this clarification.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Technical Measures regulation, I would like just to mention that – as a lot of Members of this House have said – it would make the rapporteur’s life, the committee’s life and our lives much easier if we had the regionalisation provision implemented. A lot of details that are in this regulation could then be decided by the regional bodies, so this would be a great comfort to the rapporteur and to all of you. That is why I would like to urge you to support the Commission’s proposal for regionalisation. I am afraid that in the Council meetings I cannot see a lot of progress concerning this issue. I do not want to finalise the discussion now, but we have a lack of progress in the Council. So really I think that, with regard to the reform, Parliament can give us some strength to defend this regionalisation policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning shark finning, I would like to reassure you that all the consultation procedures were followed with regard to our proposal. We did not come here without having a consultation process lasting many months. It is a process which is very well organised under very strict rules – the Commission rules. We also have an impact assessment. We try to prepare as well as possible, but, at the end of the day, we have to realise that the great majority of the Members who spoke on this issue understand the need to close all the loopholes we have in our legislation. I hope we will be able to put an end to this harmful practice. I think I have to repeat that a lot of other countries are doing the same, and they have fleets that are profitable, so please help us. Of course we need to work with our industry to find the best solutions for the implementation of this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to small-scale fisheries, there were a lot of interventions here. This is reasonable, since it is a very important issue. I would like to welcome the comments about women in the fishery sector, and we can do a lot of things here with regard to the funding ideas we have. Concerning young people, I would like to inform you that, during the last Council meeting, I announced that we are going to amend the Commission’s proposal for the next financial perspective in order to give some incentives to young people to enter the sector. This can help create a more positive climate in our coastal areas, which must be our focus. I agree with you that this has to be our main target.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to mention here that we need support in order to go for measures that can help coastal communities in a more constructive way. Let me give you an example. I am very sorry that we have missed the opportunity to have a mandatory label with the date of catch on fish products, because this would help our local fisheries a lot, because the consumer would then be informed about fresh fish and could perhaps make a different choice. Nevertheless, we are going to continue, and there are other market measures which can help the local communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can also say to you that I very much welcome all these ideas about more selective gears coming from small-scale fisheries. We are going to ring fence a great deal of money with regard to the next financial perspectives for innovation and more selective gears.</p>
      <p sl="en">A final remark about the external dimension: I can understand that this is a very complicated issue. I have also underlined that this is an issue which comes with trade policy and foreign affairs policy. We also have to concentrate on our relationships with other countries – sometimes these are countries which are not very well developed. We therefore have to bear in mind that we cannot go there to fish in the way we used to some decades ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make it clear: we need to respect these people and their sustainability issues. We have to fish only for the surplus; we have to pay adequate prices, but they also have to contribute to this change, otherwise we will not be able to fish outside European waters. It is as simple as that. We have to follow the same rules, I agree with you – all of you who intervened highlighted this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also understand that we need to move further beyond our agreements, in order to find a way to maintain a level playing field between our fishermen and the fishermen of other countries. This is the case, for instance, in the Mediterranean and in other areas where we have to work side-by-side with fishermen from other countries. We have to be sure that our fishermen who respect the rules have a level playing field with third-country vessels. This will not be easy, but we need to have a solid policy to ensure that sustainability issues concerning our waters are respected, in order to embark on international cooperation on combating illegal fisheries. This is what we are trying to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to remind you that we have some problems with our fisheries agreements. This is something which has already been mentioned, and it is not only an issue of policy. It is also an institutional problem, because cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is not at the level we would like it to be. We are facing additional problems with regard to the agreements owing to the reluctance of the Council to give Parliament a say on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to focus on these issues; we have to work together – I agree with you. I would like, Mr President, to thank all the Members; after all, we did have a positive discussion tonight.</p>

This is an important question in terms of assessing and determining how many fish we actually have. I am pleased that we agree on these issues.

The express intention of the Committee was to avoid the same problem we had some two years ago in relation to boarfish, where it was necessary for Parliament to introduce a specific amendment to allow that important lucrative fishery to exist. As a result of that, boarfish is a very sustainable and well-managed fishery.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Council refused to support the amendment and, as a result, other, non-EU countries may take advantage of this and build up historical catches. The whole purpose of the amendment was to enable the development of new fisheries into the future which, of course, is respecting UN FAO guidelines on how new and developing fisheries should be dealt with in detail.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year the Council approved the declaration on the development of fisheries. Hopefully the Council, at the December meeting, could do the same and allow us to concentrate on other fisheries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, having listened to the Commissioner, I have to say that it is a shame that she has not read my proposals. It is a shame that she does not know that all countries abiding by the attached fin rule only fish for fresh fish, as I propose. It is a shame that she does not realise that Taiwan, which has freezer vessels, is currently reviewing the rule proposed by the Commissioner due to lack of fish quality. It is also a shame that she was not honest enough to say that there is no finning taking place and that her proposal is a concession to the non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Having listened to my fellow Members make some truly incredible statements due to being out of touch with reality, I hope that they will better inform themselves before making decisions, which are never inconsequential for workers and their families.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I referred a short while ago to several important proposals contained in the report on small-scale fishing, for which I request your support tomorrow. However, I have to say that this report could and should have gone further.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition to the proposals I have already mentioned, there were others that would also have been very useful in adding value to small-scale fishing. These proposals include, for example: drawing up a specific EU programme supporting small-scale fishing; defending tailored treatment through management regimes and models adapted to the specific problems and characteristics of this sector; supporting the renewal and modernisation of the fleet; adopting forms of intervention in the sector’s value chain in cases where there is a serious imbalance, such as setting maximum intermediation margins for each agent in the chain, and enhancing the first-sale prices; and implementing and extending reserved areas with exclusive access, currently set at 12 miles, to adjacent areas, in line with the continental shelf. In the case of the outermost regions, this area should be increased from 100 to 200 miles in order to better protect local fleets and the communities that depend on them, by giving them priority access to resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regrettably, these proposals were not supported by a majority in the committee vote. However, we will not let them drop.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, it is positive that the Commission has corrected its position on the involvement of young people in this sector, but it should also have corrected many other positions, such as the restrictive definition of small-scale fishing on which it continues to insist, and the attempted imposition of a single management model, based on transferable fishing concessions, which, if approved, would have disastrous consequences for small-scale fishing in Europe, as many people are well-aware.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you to all the colleagues who have commented on and supported the report on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. We really appreciate the Commission’s original proposal and we also appreciate that the Commission welcomes the additional dimension that we have added to the external communication – the inclusion of the issues of trade, private agreements and private operators from the EU that are actually fishing outside of the EU waters. They should somehow also be included, in our view, in the external dimension of the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is now very dependent on imports of fish. We are importing 60 %, but the 40 % that is counted as ‘domestic fisheries’ is actually 23 % of the value of that, through the fisheries partnerships agreements. So this is really not sustainable. What we are doing is not sustainable; we are making ourselves more and more dependent on fish from foreign seas, and this is not how the EU should proceed.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want to take responsibility for our own consumption of fish, we must first rebuild European stocks. We should therefore take the reform of the CFP really seriously and rebuild all the European stocks to levels above those capable of producing MSY. Secondly, in our fisheries partnerships agreements we take development cooperation seriously and help developing countries to develop their own fisheries industry so that they can support their own populations and perhaps export some of the fish to us. That is the way to go.</p>

      <p sl="en">The population of salmon has dramatically decreased over the past few years, provoked by pollution, some caused by man-made problems, as well as by extensive exploitation of salmon stocks. That is why there is an obvious need for a sustainable approach in fisheries management with regard to salmon stocks in the Baltic Sea. Dealing with this issue, the Gróbarczyk report suggests that the Baltic salmon stock should be exploited in a sustainable way, according to the principle of maximum sustainable yield. I agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to ensure diversity and integrity in management of the salmon stock.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would encourage you all to fill the gaps in the existing legislation on the removal of shark fins by ensuring that all sharks captured by EU vessels throughout the world are landed with their fins naturally attached, and I would stress that no exceptions should be tolerated. I would therefore ask you to reject any attempt to introduce amendments to retain the derogation that would allow finning to go unnoticed. The adoption of this proposal would help to ensure greater protection for sharks in the EU, but it would also allow the EU to contribute to the global effort to eradicate finning, which is as cruel as it is pointless, by encouraging regional fisheries organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to adopt policies requiring sharks’ fins to be naturally attached to their bodies, without exception. Most EU citizens agree with me. We represent them and we must not forget that!</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union must support small-scale and artisanal fishing given that, in some regions, it is the locals’ sole source of income. In these circumstances, these two types of fishing could benefit from the new European Fund for Maritime and Fisheries policies, given that approximately 80 % of the Union’s fishing activities are operated by boats less than 15 m long. In Romania’s case, for instance, this is entirely accurate, as hundreds of families make a living from this type of fishing. I wish to draw attention to the fact that transferable fishing concessions could put small-scale fishermen at a serious disadvantage in relation to more competitive fishing operators. I believe that the European Parliament must strongly reject this system.</p>
