      <p sl="unknown">The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 June 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested a statement by the President of Parliament on the situation in Palestine, followed by short speeches by the chairmen of the groups.

Given the recent developments in the Palestinian regions, it is more important, as we see it, that we indeed hold a brief debate tomorrow morning to discuss the situation, the new developments, the challenges being faced and then follow this up possibly with a resolution in July where we can take all new developments into consideration, rather than the other way round. My group fully supports the proposal of having a debate tomorrow, as you suggested, Mr President, and of taking the time to propose a more well-founded and, above all, a more up-to-date resolution by the next part-session.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents decided unanimously last week to hold a major debate on Cuba in autumn, as there is no current occasion for a debate on Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet the General Affairs Council has been discussing Cuba today and yesterday and has issued conclusions showing the Council’s position in a slightly different light. For example, the Council invites a Cuban delegation to Brussels for exploratory talks, and declares its willingness to conduct comprehensive, open dialogue with the Cuban Government on all issues of mutual interest. This constitutes a current occasion, and so we should be much obliged if, despite last week’s discussion by the Conference of Presidents, the subject could now be placed on the agenda after all.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-025" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, attended this Conference of Presidents, and the proposal to hold a comprehensive debate on policy on Latin America, in which Cuba is to play a special role, in autumn was my motion on behalf of my group. Mr Nassauer is an extremely honourable, proper MEP, and what I am about to say does not apply to him, as he joined us in voting in favour of the proposal for an autumn debate at this Conference of Presidents.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, as we know, some members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats took the view – not in response to today’s decisions by the General Affairs Council but as early as last Thursday, immediately after the Conference of Presidents – that that was not on; that Cuba was at all events to be discussed immediately under urgent procedure. We also know who this was: it was chiefly the Spanish delegation in the PPE-DE Group. We have been wondering for some time whether ‘PPE’ stands for ‘Partido Popular Español’. One thing is completely clear: it is these people in the PPE-DE Group who are responsible for the fact that every opportunity is taken in this House for domestic Spanish idealogisation. I repeat, therefore: there is absolutely no point in debating Cuba under urgent procedure on Thursday afternoon. The debate would attract maybe 15 people. The European Council’s decision today to invite a Cuban delegation is a confirmation that it makes perfect sense to await this dialogue before we hold a debate here in autumn, for which we shall then be properly prepared: this is respectable politics. What we are seeing here now is domestic Spanish manoeuvring; that is what this is.</p>

      <p sl="sk">These days, the media in a number of European cities have been informing us about disasters caused by extreme weather fluctuations. Hot June weather triggers storm rainfall, causing among other things considerable concern and enormous damage to people’s property in Slovakia’s regions. What are the causes of such extreme weather?</p>
      <p sl="sk">Over the past 50 years we have created systems that quickly remove rainwater and keep the agricultural and urban landscape dry. Rainwater used to cool down the countryside and sustained a stable climate. Heat radiated by the extremely hot and dry land pushes clouds towards cooler mountain areas, where they produce precipitation causing extreme rainfall and floods.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Colleagues, as a member of the temporary Committee on Climate Change, I will be promoting solutions enabling the retention of more rainwater in the arid regions of all continents. I am convinced that this offers a way of combating climate change in a less costly and more efficient manner, which will cause less disruption. I believe I will be able to find much support for this idea in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we know that, at the last Transport Council, there was no agreement among the Member States as to how Galileo was to be funded; while highly symbolic, the project may also allow Europe to affirm its practical independence in the field of satellite communications, but lack of private-sector investment means that it cannot be completed for lack of EUR 2 400 million, and what that demonstrates is that public assistance is absolutely indispensable to major collective projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where, then, is this funding to be found? I suggest that we make use of the European financial commitments that have not been used by the Member States, in other words, the amount – between EUR 3 and 10 billion – returned every year to the various countries that have not completely used up Europe’s largesse. Use of this resource would be the most painless option for both Europe and the Member States and would enable the EU to fully play its part as an investor in the future.</p>

Această ţară este un important partener pentru Uniune în domeniul energetic şi, în această calitate, începerea negocierilor privind aderarea sa la Tratat este binevenită.

Ucraina încă nu a îndeplinit o serie de angajamente internaţionale, dintre care unele sunt menţionate în capitolul 3 al Tratatului Comunităţii Energetice.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, these associations, under the auspices of the Expellees Federation led by Erika Steinbach and Rudi Pavelka, are extremely revisionist in nature. They question the Potsdam agreements as well as the borders between Poland and Germany and the Czech Republic and Germany. The association is making territorial claims against Poland of which there are currently about 170 only in Warmia and Mazury. A number of the associations’ claims have been referred to the European Court of Human Rights, and other institutions. It is a great afront towards Poles and Czechs. A reputable institution such as the European Parliament and its President should not participate in rallies organised by revisionist organisations. In addition to this, you, Mr President, should avoid lending credence to these kinds of activities on the international stage through your personal involvement.</p>

Despite EMAS, despite Green Week, despite promises at the highest level of the European Parliament, there are still only 50 bicycles for several thousand staff, and exactly seven bicycles for the hundred-plus Members. I do not know whether the problem lies with the city of Strasbourg or with Parliament itself. All I know is that displeasure is growing, both in this House and outside.

      <p sl="sk">The Slovak Republic, along with other countries, is preparing itself for accession to the Schengen area by implementing a number of security measures. This week, an EU evaluation commission will be visiting the Slovak-Ukrainian border to judge our level of preparedness for securing the future eastern border of the Schengen area. We are also striving to meet the Eurozone accession criteria, since we consider both the Schengen area and the Eurozone to be further steps in EU integration.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Unfortunately, we often come across statements by high-ranking politicians that cast doubt on the enlargement of the Schengen borders. Recently, a statement was made by the Austrian Interior Minister in the context of next year’s UEFA European Football Championship in Vienna. In the daily Der Standard he questioned whether it would indeed be feasible to enlarge the Schengen area on 1 January 2008. I believe this was just his personal opinion. Perhaps I need not emphasise that such statements strengthen the hand of the Eurosceptics, and not only in my own country. I therefore urge the European Commission to stick strictly to the agreed accession deadlines for the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there may be a window of opportunity over the coming months to solve once and for all the issue of the seat of the European Parliament. It may be a small opportunity, but I would urge us to seize it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The combination, on the one hand, of a newly elected French President who professes to be a reformer and, on the other hand, of an IGC this autumn, which is going to agree on changes to the Treaty, is surely an opportunity we should seize. Clearly, whatever solution is found would have to compensate Strasbourg if we were to move the sessions of this Parliament to Brussels, but I believe that is possible simply by holding the meetings of the European Council itself here instead. That would give Strasbourg just as much prestige as it enjoys in hosting the sessions of the Parliament, and it would have an institutional logic. The three ordinary institutions which interact daily – the ordinary Council, the Commission and Parliament – should be in the same town, but the European Council, which is supposed to be a strategic body and take a certain distance from the day-to-day operation, could usefully meet here and at the same time solve this problem we face of having to come here every month.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, last week, seven people, including a Dutchman called Mr Dick Nicolaas, and a Frenchman, Mr Serge Atlaoui, were sentenced to death in Jakarta for manufacturing XTC and methamphetamine. Brussels has already called Jakarta to account over this and has urged Jakarta to abandon the death sentence and executions. Whilst this shows, of course, that involvement in the drugs trade is most ill-advised – it is best to steer clear of this trade altogether – the death penalty, however, cannot be justified in any way, and this is the message which the European Union has been sending out for years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Different statistics have shown that things are moving in the right direction, though, as the number of executions worldwide has dropped from 2148 in 2005 to 1591 last year. Nevertheless, it is estimated that 20 000 people are still on death row worldwide. This is why it is of the utmost importance for Europe to continue to pull its weight and do all that it can to get more countries to cross the moratorium line. This applies particularly to South-East Asia where in 2004, Indonesia suspended the moratorium on the death penalty, but the example of the Philippines, which recently abolished the death penalty, is worth following, particularly there.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The square root system proposed by Poland respects the principle of solidarity between the Member States, irrespective of their size. It also acknowledges the right of all the members of the Community to influence EU decisions and to protect national interests as far as is possible. The Polish Government submitted this proposal for consideration without presuming to determine the end solution. It is in everyone’s interests to continue searching for a compromise.

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, we must remember always, and not just in the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, that there are people living among us who are severely disabled. Those people, despite their disadvantages, play an active part in society. At an EU level, although a great deal has been done, a number of problems remain, one of which is the acknowledgement of passes for the severely disabled or the badges for their vehicles that are issued by national associations. In the Czech Republic, for example, the owners of these vehicles can park free of charge, and do not have to pay motorway tolls and charges. Unfortunately, due to the lack of harmony in the method of validating these documents in some EU Member States, disabled drivers have experienced difficulties in having their status recognised in countries such as Slovakia, Austria and Germany.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I therefore urge the competent authorities and the EU institutions, including Parliament, to address these problems and to harmonise the formats of badges for disabled drivers and the ways that they can be used throughout the EU, and also to harmonise the rules dealing with the rights and obligations of severely disabled people. The sooner this happens, the better.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the dangers posed by the European arrest warrant are clearly illustrated by the case of Mr Enrico Mariotti. Mr Mariotti was granted sanctuary in England in 1998 after being accused of crimes allegedly committed in Italy more than 30 years previously. The hearsay evidence presented against him would never have been allowed in an English court, let alone result in conviction and a prison sentence. Despite the support of many people and sections of the British media, he was recently deported to Italy by means of a European arrest warrant. He now languishes in a remote prison facing a 26-year prison sentence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Mariotti is an Italian, but the same rules apply for British citizens. The European arrest warrant means that our traditional safeguards against arbitrary arrest and extradition have been circumvented.

Many areas were left under water in a very short period of time. Schools had to be evacuated and old people’s homes and even hospitals had to be closed. Hundreds of emergency calls were made within a period of two hours and many people had to be evacuated from their homes because of the flood damage. The Fire and Rescue Service was stretched to the limit, but I commend them on their excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in the early hours of 16 May, a group of young Spanish and Portuguese people – seven in all – did something that I would consider to be rather unwise: following a party they grabbed some Latvian pennants in the city of Riga, at which point they were arrested by the Latvian police, imprisoned and some of them ill-treated. For some time the Spanish Embassy was not informed of the arrest. Furthermore, they were kept in prison for 17 days and not allowed to leave Latvia for a month.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem is that these young people are accused of serious offences against the security of the Latvian State – which I would describe more as hooliganism – and this raises the issue of the extent to which the Latvian authorities realise that by indulging in this kind of security measure and applying criminal legislation adopted for other purposes, their behaviour is not what is normally expected of authorities when it comes to maintaining security within the Member States.</p>

Punctul principal de pe ordinea de zi l-a reprezentat cooperarea dintre Uniunea Europeană şi regiunea Mării Negre, în contextul aderării României şi Bulgariei la 1 ianuarie 2007, şi a lansării Comunicării Comisiei Europene „Sinergia Mării Negre - o nouă cooperare regională”. După 1 ianuarie 2007, regiunea Mării Negre este graniţa de est a Uniunii Europene, implicit asigurarea stabilităţii şi securităţii în zonă devenind o prioritate pentru noi toţi. Prin programele sale, Uniunea Europeană trebuie să continue să încurajeze reformele economice şi democratice şi să susţină dezvoltarea regiunii Mării Negre. Însă resursele pentru dialog, pentru construcţie şi, în final, pentru pace, se află în regiunea Mării Negre, şi numai folosirea acestei oportunităţi de către fiecare ţară din regiune poate transforma ideile bune în realitate.</p>

După cum se ştie, ieri a avut loc cel de-al doilea tur al alegerilor locale. Deşi observatorii independenţi ai desfăşurării campaniei au dezvăluit numeroase neregularităţi, iar Partidul Comunist aflat la putere a folosit pârghiile administrative la nivel central şi local pentru a-şi crea un avantaj în competiţia cu celelalte partide, primăria oraşului Chişinău, capitala Republicii Moldova, a fost câştigată de candidatul Partidului Liberal, Dorin Chirtoacă. Dânsul este un tânăr politician, cu vederi moderniste şi pro-europene, iar victoria opoziţiei ne-comuniste este o victorie a democraţiei în republica Moldova. Ţara mea, România, doreşte să vadă într-o bună zi Moldova ca membră a Uniunii Europene. Cât de apropiată sau îndepărtată va fi acea zi, depinde doar de cetăţenii şi de clasa politică din Moldova, şi de felul în care vor reuşi să reformeze societatea şi economia în această ţară.

      <p sl="pl">The current crisis in this sector is threatening the health of Polish society and undermines the dignity of those working in the field of healthcare, including doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in my opinion, needless cruelty to animals is still considered legitimate in the European Union. Therefore, a survey under my patronage on the establishment of a European Centre for the Protection and Welfare of Animals, based on an idea by Dr Ganzer and Dr Habersack, who are both active in the field of animal protection, and presented by Mr Moser, met with great support from the Members in the House when I presented it here on Wednesday. One thing this Centre envisages is the Europe-wide integration of animal-protection initiatives in order to take animal protection forward more effectively. The Centre will also be an instrument for the development of common standards to guide or be applied by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The activities of this Centre could also include the active exchange of information, the development of labelling, and scientific studies. Therefore, this event, attended by members of the Animal Welfare Intergroup and of ‘Aktiver Tierschutz Steiermark’ – an animal-protection organisation in Styria – as well as European politicians, was an important step for the EU in the field of animal protection.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European press have recently reported that a powerful Russian nuclear bomb is located in Andreev Bay, 40km off the coast of Norway, and that this bomb could contaminate the northern reaches of our continent. The used uranium rods from Russian nuclear power stations that are being stored there could explode at any point, causing an environmental disaster the effects of which experts cannot even estimate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This situation is the result of the inexplicable short-sightedness displayed by the Russian authorities and their contempt for matters relating to protecting the environment. In this respect, the attitude of President Putin’s government is a carbon copy of the approach often taken during the Soviet era.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no doubt that this environmental time-bomb, located at the bottom of Andreev Bay, needs to be immediately defused. The Member States of the European Union, in cooperation with Norway, should immediately begin intensive talks with the Russians and force them to take decisive action to secure the nuclear waste stockpiles. Europe cannot afford another Chernobyl.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() I would like to make a few important points about the current adoption of development programmes and systems for their implementation as a way of disbursing EU funds. I am aware of the fact that the Commission has been toiling heroically in this respect, but we must emphasise that, particularly in the new Member States, the national administrations often do not have sufficient assets. It should be acknowledged, among other things, that several countries in this category do not possess know-how on the best practices concerning implementation, that there is a shortage of skilled workers in the labour markets of these countries, and that their information and monitoring systems lack quality software.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Therefore, I would like to urge the Commission to continue to be involved in this matter and to enable maximum levels of interconnection between the national implementation systems, as well as the exchange of information on problems and problem-solving, and on best practice concerning efficient operations in this area, with the information flowing mainly from the old Member States to the new ones, for example, by means of a dedicated website, workshops on problem areas, and the like.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, getting rid of mines laid in Cyprus in 1974 in the buffer zone between the invading Turkish army and the defending Cypriot forces is a step towards peace. The process started approximately one year ago with the assistance of the EU. Minefields to which access was possible from the Cypriot-Government-controlled area have now been cleared, but demining in areas for which the Turkish army’s permission is necessary has not taken place because the generals in Ankara disagree. It is difficult to understand why Turkey, which has the second largest army in Europe after Russia, is afraid of tiny Cyprus.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-072" speaker_id="28124" name="Gunnar Hökmark" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The internet and broadband emerged, in the way we know it today, in the middle of the 1990s; it was, then, only about 10 years ago that these phenomena started to change the world. No one at that time could have foreseen the impact of this change or how it would transform societies and change the pattern of the world economy. No one at that time could have predicted what would come of it and what opportunities it would give to individuals all over the world. I think it is important to say the same thing today. No one knows how big the changes will be. We only know one thing: the changes arising from broadband development will be much more far-reaching this time than those of the last 10 years because the speed of change is greater today than it was then.</p>
      <p sl="en">This provides important grounds for decision-making in the European Union. It is important to have stable rules and institutions that allow for new entrepreneurs, new ideas and new technologies to come along, and that allow for the dynamic, not only in the economy, but also in society, to make full use of broadband.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the development of broadband is a unique opportunity above all for the European Union, because it combines growth, and opportunities for growth, with the cohesion of different regions. It binds people and regions together at the same time as giving new opportunities for growth and new jobs. It distributes opportunities for growth in different areas, and we can see from globalisation what this brings us. It brings countries and regions closer to each other, but also provides a huge number of new opportunities. For the European Union, this is a special thing, because we can be at the forefront of the development of e-health, e-learning, e-government, e-trade, e-medicine etc. if we ensure that we are the region in the world that is moving most in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some important points of departure that must be based on the fact that the value of broadband depends on the number of users. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for us to get people all over the Union connected as soon as possible. It is of importance to us all, wherever we live. The second thing is that the value of broadband is also dependent on the content, which is why it is important that it is open to as many as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are five points that I would like to highlight that are underlined in the report. First of all, the more competition there is, the faster the markets today develop the deployment of broadband. In those countries and regions where there is a lot of competition, the deployment of broadband is faster than in other parts of the Union. That means it is important not to distort competition but to open up more competition in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, there are few areas where it is better to use European funding than in this area, provided certain preconditions are fulfilled: for example, where the market cannot provide for deployment or when it is a question of increasing the level of advanced technology in this area – which is not just about deployment as such but ensuring that we are in the technological lead.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sure that the EU can be the leader but that also means that we should highlight some other points. First of all, two preconditions for EU funding: there should be a level playing field where we are funding, and we should use the funding in such a way that it will increase the technology, not only deployment. We do not need the old technologies, we need the new technologies because they are the best, especially for outlying regions, where costs decrease the more advanced technologies are.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, we need to have neutrality between different technologies, different operators, different content providers and different services. If we do that, we can make full use of what this technology can give the European Union. We can be at the forefront technologically and in terms of making use of opportunities and we can ensure that we combine growth with cohesion, which will make European citizens stronger in the society and the world in which they live.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member Gunnar Hökmark on a tremendous job and for rightly mentioning what this is all about. It is incredible; we cannot even begin to suggest how things might be 10 years from now. The European Parliament supports you, and your report contains very interesting points.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank the other committee members involved – Mr Harbour, Mrs Bourzai and Mr Sakalas – for contributing to this work. It is a united effort, so to speak. Last but not least, let me thank all those who took an active part in our ‘Bridging the Broadband Gap’ conference, held in Brussels in May: Mr Hökmark, Mrs Bourzai, Mr Harbour, Mr Goepel and Mr Chatzimarkakis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s vision is for it to be the norm for European citizens to be connected to broadband and to have a choice of services at their disposal. Competition is the main channel for delivering investment and innovation. However, there is a ‘but’: as we are aware, rural areas and disadvantaged regions are struggling. These are economic areas where ICT is not an option. Rural diversification and economic growth require the diffusion of innovative technologies and the adoption of an active ICT policy by regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission has built this aspect into regional policy and into agriculture and rural development. We estimate that in the new programming period – 2007 to 2013 – about EUR 65 billion from the European Regional Development Fund will be devoted to rural areas. Furthermore, 4.4% of cohesion policy resources – EUR 14 billion – will be invested in priorities directly linked to the information society.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe, we recognise both the primacy and the limits of the market in pushing broadband forward. Several public initiatives are being undertaken where the market does not work. It is a fact, however, that the gap between urban and rural areas is increasing rather than closing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you some figures. Thirty percent of the rural population is excluded from broadband coverage, compared to an EU average of 10%. Only 10% of the rural population subscribes to it, compared to 17% of the EU population. The most common speed in rural areas is below 512 kilobytes per second, while the average in the EU is as much as one megabyte per second. Poor broadband access widens not only the digital divide, but also the economic and social divides.</p>
      <p sl="en">Local and regional authorities have a key role to play in bridging that gap. Public policies, however, must respect state aid rules. Broadband markets are highly innovative and governments need to take care not to pre-empt them or to distort competition. But if a government believes that current services are inadequate, it can step in. Under state aid rules, the Commission has taken 26 decisions clarifying when public intervention is acceptable from the point of view of competition policy because it tackles real market failures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Hökmark’s report has highlighted the fact that broadband is increasingly a service of general economic interest. The Commission faces the question of whether broadband should be part of universal service obligations. To date, broadband is not included, as you are aware. We must think about what we mean when we call for broadband for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">We may also need to look again at funding issues. We need proper consideration of this issue, which is why the Commission will publish a Green Paper early next year to launch a wide-ranging policy debate on the issue among all stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important aspect of this policy is radio spectrum. Wireless technologies are crucial for rural areas, but wireless technologies will become reality if – and only if – radio spectrum is available and accessible to market players ready to invest. We need a spectrum policy that is more flexible and, where appropriate, market driven. We need a more coordinated approach. This is the line the Commission will take in the forthcoming review of the telecom rules. That review will be fundamental to the further enhancement of competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, where market failure is clear, public authorities should step in and equip their territory with the appropriate broadband capabilities. In any case, we will continue working on the exchange of best practice and make sure that all regions are up to speed.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Commissioner and Mr Gunnar Hökmark, allow me to thank you for both your ideas and for your vision for implementing them. The Committee on Legal Affairs fully understands the importance of broadband links for the economy of the European Union and, therefore, the committee does not dispute any of its important economic aspects.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, there is still the legal side. Today broadband links are in the hands of private capital, and private capital organises it only wherever it yields a profit. The profits are to be made in the larger urban concentrations, the larger cities, but not in the villages or remote rural areas. However, it is the Committee on Legal Affairs' opinion that every inhabitant of the European Union has the right to use broadband links regardless of whether he lives in a city or in a remote rural area, and he should have the opportunity to exercise that right. Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends to the Commission that wherever private capital has not provided broadband links, Structural Funds should be used for the introduction of these links.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering Commissioner Reding my warmest congratulations. Just as she predicted, the Regulation on roaming is to enter into force by summer. This represents a great achievement on the part of the Council, Parliament and the Commission. We have solved a problem together, and can be proud that the Regulation will enter into force under this German Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last Friday, when I flew out from a German airport, I saw the first brochure from German operator T-Mobile presenting its mobile roaming rates under the protective tariff. It is clear that this is working. We are also proud that, if European consumers conclude new contracts before their holidays, these European protective tariffs will of course apply from the first day of entry into force of the Regulation. It was hard work pushing this through, but we have managed to do so before the summer, and I believe that the development of competition in this field will also be extremely positive. It will take us another three months to achieve transparency in the field of broadband, too; and so more time will be needed to achieve it for the use of UMTS. We should attempt as soon as possible to offer a ‘flat rate’ or a standardised tariff in this field, too, so as to enable comparison of the costs of broadband across Europe and worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Africa, for example, there are already 15 countries among whom no roaming charges are levied. In Europe, too, there are already telecommunications operators who do not charge a roaming tariff across a number of borders, and there are also operators offering special charges on their own network in a certain region. It is clear, therefore, that there is a very positive trend in competition. Accordingly, for the future, we can envisage having billing systems that charge customers on a bit basis, and we can envisage promoting bilateral agreements at international level that enable us to enjoy this broadband technology at reasonable prices.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Commission for its commitment to bridging the gap that exists in the broadband technology sector, which is regarded as a factor not only in speeding up economic and social integration but also in reducing various forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having access to this sort of technology at a reasonable price does in fact appear to be an essential throughout the EU, firstly in order to guarantee high-quality service, secondly in order to promote competitiveness and productivity throughout the EU and to do so at the same time as respecting the environment, since certain physical displacements become superfluous; and finally in order to facilitate the development of a knowledge-based society by including everyone in a society founded upon information and communication.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Hökmark’s report does contain some good things, for example when it stresses education and providing schools with computer equipment. The fact is – although older members of the public must not be forgotten – that everything starts with the first learning experiences and with access to tools in the places where basic education is provided. I am thinking in particular of such places as universities and training centres, although the development of health services on the Internet is another particularly important line of development, making treatment protocols and individual follow-up procedures easier. Another line of development is the work being done to make government services accessible on line, which makes them approachable, results in time benefits and brings the services available closer to the public.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I appreciate the attention that the rapporteur has given to the comments we made and which were primarily aimed at taking practical account of the expectations of our fellow citizens, and in such a way that the technological response would improve their day-to-day lives. We have tackled the broadband issue in the context of the goals of the EU and in accordance with the mandate given to us by Parliament, and this with a view to enabling everyone to have access to broadband and enabling it to play its part in bringing about economic, social and – of course – territorial integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do find it regrettable, however, that greater emphasis was not put on regional development and that more research was not done on access for the members of the public who find such access most difficult, such as elderly people and people with disabilities. We need to do everything possible to improve access to the digital culture and to offer content that meets the needs and expectations of all members of the public. However rapid the technology, it is always the way in which it is used that gets the best out of the service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a good thing, then, that broadband should be accessible by everyone, but public places – free of charge if possible – are also needed where people can access broadband and familiarise themselves with these technologies. The fact is that ICTs are particular goods that can be considered as resources on the grounds that they perform a real social and cultural role, and we have just heard Commissioner Kroes say that they could be regarded as a service of general interest. I shall hold on not only to the idea, but also to the prospect that she holds out, as installing broadband is a matter of political will and is not just about developing competition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Hökmark for his excellent cooperation. We have worked out various compromises together.</p>
      <p sl="de">The development mentioned by Mr Hökmark in his report covers all the relevant technical areas in the field of broadband. He covers all aspects excellently; the most important being developments in rural areas, of course – where we can see a great divide. Basically, we can speak of the ‘broadband paradox’: urban areas, where broadband is not actually necessary, have a high proportion of broadband users, whereas rural areas do not. We must therefore find ways of increasing the proportion there.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also discussed the ‘digital dividend’. In the European frequency landscape, frequencies are becoming free that can be used for mobile broadband solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must also discuss the major task of who should develop the relevant infrastructure and how to deal with the private operators investing in this and expecting a return on their investment. As a Liberal I would willingly leave everything to the market, of course – and I know that Mr Hökmark, too, has a liberal soul – but we must also recognise that this is not happening in rail transport or education, and so even the Liberals have to admit that other ways must be found of obtaining investment in this.</p>
      <p sl="de">A bonus system has been mentioned. I am glad that the report leaves this option open and allows this kind of bonus as a means of bridging the broadband gap, particularly in rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I felt like calling out to Commissioner Kroes, who is now responsible for competition, that not everything can be looked at from a entirely puristic, theoretical angle. Sometimes, particularly in a world developing rapidly at global level, it is necessary to abandon introspection and adapt our competition rules to global conditions. This is a small field where we can do so. For this reason, I am particularly pleased that support policy is being changed, that resources from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Agricultural Fund can be used for the development of infrastructures. What is even more important as regards competition policy, however, is technology neutrality: in this regard the Commissioner has taken the right course – on which I also congratulate Commissioner Reding.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one further aspect I should like to address. The development of broadband infrastructure in Europe can only be achieved by having a ‘man on the moon’ objective. In my opinion, this objective could consist in enabling the maximum number of people possible to vote by e-mail in the 2009 European elections. This would exert pressure on Member States to achieve participation of 25% or perhaps even more of their population in this wonderful instrument, which will take Europe forward. E-mail voting for the 2009 European elections – I believe that would be a significant new challenge!</p>
      <p sl="de">Once more, thank you for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hökmark for such a wonderful report. We openly support the Commission’s initiative in which it urges all of the Member States to address the broadband imbalances, because broadband should be a general and universal service, and it is the only way to overcome the digital divide, not just between cities and rural areas, but also certain areas of cities and other less-favoured ones.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to achieve this objective, however, we need to clarify various aspects. Firstly, the technologies to be used in order to achieve this end, because we all have the right to use the same kind of connection, an interoperable kind. We are therefore emphasising the fact that, in order to achieve technological neutrality, we need free standards and the extension and involvement of broadband.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that the Commission’s initiative should consider wireless broadband mobile services as a solution for the regions for which access is most difficult. There are legal and technical problems standing in the way of this wireless access. Some courts have said that it is not possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like a response from the Commission with regard to issues relating to competition and the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another thing I would like to know is whether the fact that broadband distribution may be carried out in a particular way could create specific technological dependence on particular companies. What we mean is that we cannot create technological dependence on a few companies, and regions must therefore be educated technologically with a view to promoting the use of free standards in all of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must welcome the fact that Mr Hökmark has included in his report a proposal for funding that is full, clean and neutral in terms of competition. Nevertheless, I would like to know what mechanism will have to be used in order to achieve that neutrality and how we can incentivise innovation in order to achieve our final objective, which is the distribution of broadband to all of Europe’s users.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, broadband represents an unprecedented opportunity in terms of information, communication, participation, education and professional life.</p>
      <p sl="it">As such, this opportunity should be accessible by everyone. In fact, extending access to all is a prerequisite for social development, better public services and knowledge-based economic growth. In order to achieve universal access to broadband, the European Union has a duty to ensure that all citizens can access it, allowing the consequent benefits to spread throughout Europe and in particular to developed regions. In other words, we must bridge the digital divide. The market alone is not enough. In addition to market forces, it is important for Member States, and regions and local authorities in particular, to establish incentives to promote the development of broadband in disadvantaged regions.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, broadband, the spectrum offered to wireless links and to satellite mobile communications, must be made available via free, transparent and open tendering. The authorities must also leave room for experimentation in part of the spectrum, which can be used by new technologies and new types of organisation. Only if we are able to make the spectrum an asset available to all will it be possible to invest in the future for a better society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very impressed to see the Commissioners for Competition and Information Technology job-sharing this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the headlong rush to universal provision of broadband access to the internet, let us remember the impact of this technology on older people and less mobile people. It can be a great benefit, but it can also be a great challenge. We must remember that there are those people who may not be able, or who may not wish, to use the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">I suggest that achieving our dynamic knowledge-based economy is not so much about access to knowledge as what we do with it. I cannot help wondering whether we are not at risk of turning our citizens into couch potatoes, sitting in front of their computer screens and having to resort to virtual exercise rather than the real thing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note a recent report in the press that there has been a marked slow-down of internet shopping in the United States because – surprise – people still want to go to the shop and see the product for themselves and touch it, and not just see it virtually.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, I would guess that we all agree that broadband is a good thing – we are all in favour of it – but I ask myself whether we really need 62 paragraphs to say so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when I was listening to my esteemed colleague, Mr Rübig, a moment ago, I thought I was in a time warp addressing a rather different issue, but then I realised he had just ‘roamed’ off the subject.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur Mr Hökmark: of course we are unanimous on this. A society that fosters growth and employment is not possible if it is unable to exploit and develop broadband thoroughly. It is of benefit in many areas: small and medium-sized companies, the school system, public health care, and so on. On the other hand, the revolution in the entertainment industry is now under way and technology there is changing more quickly than legislation. A knowledge-based economy, however, will not succeed by following the circus. Broadband is a pre-requirement for a more equal information society. That is why to use it in its basic format should be free, like the social services when you are checking through your own patient records. Moreover, although search engines are effective, we have a lot of work to do to improve services.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Information and communications technology is the fastest growing sector of industry in the Union. Nevertheless, many Member States are not investing in it, but are letting the rest of the world pass them by. It makes you wonder what decade, or perhaps what century, they are living in some places. The Nordic countries, for example, are an exception.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to make it a basic assumption that all new buildings will have broadband. In addition, Member States must enlighten their citizens as to the opportunities afforded by broadband. Not only that, but we have to open our eyes to the new and huge task that lies ahead. We have to create a new democracy for the information age. It will differ from the present one in that, for example, the electorate is present the whole time. This will hopefully be a more demanding and more productive democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the rapporteur that the Union’s task is not to finance the deployment of broadband. That is indeed the task of the market. However, I also agree with Commissioner Kroes’s statement that the Commission can, in certain circumstances, allow state aid if it is clear that market forces will not or cannot fill the high-speed communications gap. ‘White areas’ – i.e. areas which are rural, underpopulated and commercially unattractive to broadband providers – must be part of the interconnection that we all speak of today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ireland, with approximately one-third of its population living in rural areas, has poor broadband penetration. This matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and state aid may well need to be part of the package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rural areas throughout the EU must be part of the broadband revolution, otherwise areas already lagging behind will fall further behind and we will be unable to achieve a balance of development between the regions. As the rapporteur himself put it, we need growth with cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() First of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, for a very good and balanced report. I am not going to dwell on the report and emphasise how important the further expansion of broadband connections is for the economic development of the European Union and its Member States. I would primarily like to highlight a problem concerning access to these networks in rural, remote or less densely populated areas.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This problem is apparent in most of the new Member States. Underdeveloped regions, in particular, need much more attention than has been accorded them so far by the European Union and, particularly, by national governments. The challenge is to encourage and motivate broadband operators to invest more into these regions. In my opinion, national, regional and local authorities should come up with new systemic incentives, including tax measures or easier access to public funding by means of public-private projects, primarily focusing on building up the technical infrastructure for broadband networks in such areas.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Public funds invested under such schemes will be recouped very rapidly, as business is promoted through the knowledge economy and public services are provided more efficiently, for example, by means of e-government, e-health, e-learning or e-procurement. On the other hand, I would like to call on the European Commission to seriously consider these aspects when formulating European policy on broadband connectivity and conceiving a regulatory framework.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Paradoxically, too tight a regulatory policy in an area so important in terms of boosting European economic competitiveness could cause a slowdown in economic development as well as larger disparities between regions. I, for one, believe that at this stage of developing broadband connections the potential implementation of unbundling may play a rather negative role by decreasing the rate of private investment into less developed regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, rapporteur, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me raise a few points. I found Commissioner Kroes’s commentary most fascinating; I am sure that what she said was all agreed with you.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have some questions in this regard. The Commissioner mentioned that it will be possible to consider drawing funding from the European Regional Development Fund for the promotion of broadband. I should like her to tell me how she envisages that this will take place. Will it be the subject of a communication? What will the criteria be? How is it to be announced? What procedure will be followed? Will it come under traditional State aid, according to the current definition, or does she envisage a special communication in this regard? If a special communication is issued, what will be the procedure for agreeing this? How does she plan to verify that these enterprises are really installing broadband capabilities in accordance with the competition rules and not simply producing a costing and saying, ‘That is a great idea, and we would like to help ourselves to this aid in all regions that are ‘uncompetitive’, as it were’? I would be grateful if the Commissioner would explain this once more.</p>
      <p sl="de">There was a second comment from the Commissioner’s colleague, who mentioned that the Commissioner is contemplating a Green Paper dealing with public services in this field, which may, among other things, include broadband. I have some questions about this, too. When does she plan to issue this Green Paper and what kind of consultation procedure will be applied? When will she be bringing the consultation procedure to public attention?</p>
      <p sl="de">My final question is as follows. Can she perhaps provide an overview of the extent to which financial support is already being provided to the field of broadband development from the structural and regional programmes? If I am not mistaken, this is already taking place. I would be grateful if she could provide me with written information on this – it does not have to be today.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Hökmark on his excellent approach to the subject and, secondly, to take my turn to emphasise that the lack of access to broadband connections is one aspect of the more general problem generally referred to as the digital divide.</p>
      <p sl="el">This divide is particularly prevalent between generations, enterprises and areas. The problem is even more acute in remote and inaccessible areas, such as island and mountain areas, and in rural areas, where demand is particularly weak and, as such, there is little commercial interest.</p>
      <p sl="el">Consequently, competition per se is not the solution to the problem. Targeted actions need to be taken to bridge the broadband divide in general.</p>
      <p sl="el">The following are some of the actions which I consider important: the Member States must step up the learning of information technology in compulsory education and give greater support to the development of content in their language. This will assist penetration to larger sections of the population. I believe that subsidies for financially deprived citizens to acquire broadband connections and suitable equipment will be of equal help. The citizens themselves must also learn the major practical applications of broadband, such as teleworking, new medical diagnostic and treatment services and contemporary education and public services.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course all this is also hugely important to the development of European competitiveness, offering opportunities for new pioneering small and medium-sized enterprises and increased productivity in general.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I consider that public financing and public private partnerships should be further developed in poorly served areas.</p>

      <p sl="es">The high cost of broadband networks and services and the lower returns from investments in island and sparsely-populated regions must never be a justification for restrictions to access. Any possible lack of incentive amongst providers as a result of scant commercial interest must be offset by strategies based on greater technological development and more innovation in order to provide operators with better opportunities for entering the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I also wanted to stress the public service role of infrastructures and services relating to information and communications technologies; it falls to the public authorities to guarantee all of the citizens access to information and communications technologies so that they benefit the whole population without exceptions.</p>

In this spirit I welcome the resolution we are debating today and which the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In the European Union the desire to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world was established as the main goal of the Lisbon Strategy. We have found, however, that we are not entirely fulfilling the goals we have set ourselves. I also regard this document, which was drafted by the European Commission and which is inseparably linked to the Lisbon Strategy, as the identification of a problem, and at the same time as an inducement for us to take a forward step in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sl">First and foremost we must encourage the balanced development of a suitable infrastructure, which will enable every inhabitant of the European Union, regardless of his geographical location or social status, to have access to high-quality broadband connections. These connections must have the functional capacity to ensure that users can reach the entire range of services offered. In this respect I wish above all to highlight the raising of the threshold in defining what broadband is. Indeed we must exploit its potential in the area of data transfer, distance working, the attainment of digital literacy, and its use in educational processes and so forth. So broadband services do not only provide opportunities for entertainment, but also for the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">On both the European Union level and the Member State level we need measures to encourage investment in this area on the principle of public-private partnership and equal access to those providing services and those using them.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, high-quality broadband Internet is certainly one of the areas into which the EU should be channelling its efforts and which it should be supporting. Without fast, permanent connections, it will certainly not be possible for us to create a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based European economy. We must therefore give the green light to support for free Internet access through the construction of free-of-charge networks supported by the structural funds and other public funds.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We also feel, however, that the towns and cities are closest to the citizens. The local authorities in towns and cities can best assess needs and adopt the best ways of supporting broadband at a local level. In practice, however, local governments often fall foul of the conflict between, on the one hand, the rules on public funding, and on the other hand effective support for free Internet access through the development of free-of-charge networks supported by the structural funds and other funds. If a city decides, for example, within the context of developing services for its citizens, to support a free-of-charge wifi site, businesses offering Internet connection will immediately accuse it of distorting economic competition.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission should therefore look carefully into the rules governing the use of structural funds and the rural development fund for developing broadband. It should then adopt more precise rules to handle situations where broadband services are developed with the help of the structural funds and public funding in areas where there is already a partial provision of these services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I must apologise to the rapporteur and the Commissioner for missing my slot earlier, but I was viewing another form of European technology at the Paris Air Show and came here as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating almost all elements of our opinion, including some of our suggestions, into his report. His report is to be commended, because it takes a very broad view of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report quite rightly emphasises that the provision of broadband is an extremely dynamic and evolving market. Many comments have already been made in the debate about the importance of spreading broadband, particularly into rural areas, where it is more difficult to provide services. However, the new wireless and satellite technologies are opening up those markets at a far lower cost than ever before, which is important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would caution colleagues who have been calling for local authority or state support for infrastructure. Frankly, the problem is that if you invest in infrastructure it will soon be out of date and it is not characteristic of state enterprises to sustain investment, or even to sustain consistent policy. We do not want to crowd out the private providers of competing technologies. Where there is a market failure, it would be far better, as our opinion states, for authorities to act as the lead customer and to aggregate demand, e.g. from their education and social services, and offer those launch contracts to private providers, ensuring that competition is kept in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know the Commissioner is extremely keen on this approach to broadband provision. We fully support her desire to sustain competition as the main medium of delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I want to pick up on an earlier comment by my friend Erika Mann: as the lead committee for universal service end-users’ rights – and having dealt with that directive before – we await the Commission’s Green Paper on this subject with great interest. Our opinion and the Hökmark report indicate some directions we wish the Commissioner to look at. It is quite clear that the issue of universal service needs to be looked at, but we should be very cautious about applying a new rigid formula given the dynamic state of the market and the fact that broadband demand will continue to increase.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like, above all, to thank the rapporteur and the Members of your House for this very important mission. We are concerned here with what is in fact a people-focused policy, in view of the fact that neither the economy nor the market can, on its own, provide people in the regions with access to broadband, and we all know that broadband accelerates development and reduces inequality insofar as people have access to it. This access problem, then, needs to be addressed by us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My use of the pronoun ‘us’ indicates the obvious – that the Commissioner within whose remit this dossier falls cannot handle it alone, and that is why we in the Commission have combined our forces, so that Mrs Kroes has started work on it – and I will take this opportunity to thank her for that, and for having positively immersed herself in it – while it also has to be said that state aid is an essential feature. The Commissioner responsible for rural development is also working on it, however, as are the Commissioner responsible for regional development and the Commissioner with responsibility for consumer affairs, so responsibilities really are being pooled within the Commission in order to resolve these problems. I believe that Commissioner Kroes has already spoken to you about state subsidies and told you that she has decided that such aid should be given subject to very clear and precise conditions, at the point at which the market is unable to resolve these problems on its own.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Broad-based debate will be of use to us in considering the universality of service provision; does it really need to be extended at a time like the present, when it does not include broadband, or is it not necessary to extend it? In the course of this evening’s debates I have already heard some very divergent positions articulated, and we will need to clarify these; that is why we are going to use the Green Paper that I intend to put before you in early 2008 as a means of launching a broad debate that will enable us to see how to legislate on these matters, or what sort of legislation is to be avoided.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning quite specific elements, it is clear that the Commission will not only make speeches or organise conferences, such as the conference on bridging the digital divide in rural areas some weeks ago, but will also take specific action. For instance, we will launch a website before the end of this year to act as a central information platform publishing calls for tender and providing a one-stop-shop for exchange of best practice. We hope that this website will become a virtual meeting point between suppliers and local governments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second action concerns the new programming period of the Structural Funds and it includes the initiative ‘Regions for economic change’, which aims to help Member States implement the new Lisbon Strategy through action aimed at economic modernisation. This initiative includes two thematic networks on ICT, broadband and e-government. Finally, there will be the European transnational networks initiative that will help authorities planning transport and energy infrastructure and make them take account of the telecom needs as well, because deploying DACs and DAC fibre alongside this infrastructure may reduce the future telecom costs by 80 %, so it will be very important to foresee the exploitation of synergies when making this kind of investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I am also very conscious of the fact that technologies such as WiMAX or satellites will be an alternative to fibre and DACs, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has been asked whether we can provide more precise guidance regarding the use of Structural Funds, in particular, where a partial supply of such service already exists. Since 2003, there have been guidelines for the use of Structural Funds in the electronic communications, but 2003 is a very long time ago in a field where technology is very fast-moving. That is why, over the past two years, the Commission has developed the consistent decision practice of applying state aid rules to broadband support measures. Most of the measures assessed contain Structural Fund co-financing. We have already issued 26 decisions in this area and those clarify further under which conditions public funds for broadband can be granted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I would also like to say that these EU funds are not allocated to private enterprises: they are allocated to public authorities and it is those public authorities, for instance the regional authorities, which define their operational programmes. The Commission does not supervise those projects except for the large projects over EUR 50 million. Those then undergo examination by DG REGIO, DG COMM and/or DG INFSO.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another point which has been made is the question of our citizens who suffer from some form of disability during their lifetime. Now these may be disabled people, but we will also have an ageing population. We have calculated that about 50 % of our citizens will be disabled at least once during their lifetime. Therefore, at the end of last month we issued a communication on ageing well in the information society. Here we focus on making all ICT services accessible to citizens and to help most of all those with special needs. I believe that this will go beyond the regional questions and the digital divide and will be one of the problems we will have to solve in months and years to come. I would really like Parliament to come in on this question, which will also be an important topic for discussion with our citizens, above all in the prospect of the European elections to come.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make one last point. All this is wonderful, but we need spectrum and that is why we are working on having spectrum available for all these services which will be needed by one technology or another in our rural areas for our ageing society. I am, of course, referring to health, but also to the questions of education and of e-government, which are crucial elements. As regards e-government, we will be holding a big ministerial conference, together with stakeholders, in September and will discuss how to make better use of the services in order to reach the population, important above all for the ageing population and for people who live far away from urban centres.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the Commission is working on making spectrum available for example for the 2.6 MHz band. I am really counting on the positive effect of the digital dividend when we switch from analogue to digital, where we should be looking at the spectrum below 1 MHz. This is very interesting indeed for the new services which we will need in order to have broadband for all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you, rapporteur, for the important work which has been done. This is only the beginning of the work we have to do together in order to make Europe a place of equilibrium between all citizens allowing them to access the new technology without a digital divide but, rather, with a digital dividend for our society.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The relevant conclusion from the report presented by Gunnar Hökmark is that the spread of broadband communication technologies is not, in the strict sense, just a technical issue, but also has an impact on many other areas in the EU’s life. In relation to the Lisbon Strategy, we are increasingly drawing attention to the fact that in terms of competitiveness, it is becoming ever more glaring how far Europe is lagging behind compared to other regions in the world. The fact that broadband solutions are gaining more ground could significantly reverse the trend towards declining competition. On the one hand, it would make Europe’s economy operate more efficiently, while it could also give a boost to research and development, another area where the EU is also lagging far behind.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We believe that it is essential to create a strong, effective Community regulatory framework, to harmonise regulations in this sector, as well as dismantle the various barriers distorting the operation of the market. We also need to encourage Member States to devise effective local development programmes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As far as the spread of broadband technology in the new Member States is concerned, structural funds will play a vital role in this, especially as these countries lag considerably behind compared to the old Member States. Supporting broadband solutions is not simply an economic issue. The diffusion of these solutions will also promote the principle of solidarity. Establishing broadband connections in the more sparsely populated areas may help to encourage the local population to remain in their villages and to connect the less mobile sections of society to the EU’s economic and cultural vitality.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last but not least, it will also help to protect the environment. This is precisely why we can say that the spread of broadband Internet is in Europe’s common interest, extending far beyond its intrinsic significance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, who wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, and the members of the various committees involved in drawing up this excellent report. She also wishes to express her appreciation for the good cooperation between all involved in Parliament and the Council, and to thank the Council for its work. As a result of this cooperation, the work has moved smoothly and steadily towards achieving the result of which we are all aware.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 15 December 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks. Since then, a whole series of discussions have taken place: a public hearing took place in Parliament on 20 July 2006; there were reports from the Committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; there were opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. This process has been very intensive and constructive under the codecision procedure. A series of informal trialogues took place which led to the Council’s general approach, which not only accommodates most of the Member States’ concerns, but also reflects the European Parliament’s powers of codecision by taking the vast majority of its proposals on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">One proposal in particular that has been taken on board is the abolition of the initial proposal for the categorisation of spirit drinks; secondly, the introduction of a strong quality policy for spirit drinks; thirdly, the withdrawal of the proposal to allow flavours to be added to eau de vie; and fourthly, the strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament by introducing the regulatory committee with scrutiny procedures in most of the cases for which provision is made for comitology. Those are just a few of the essential amendments which were introduced on the initiative of the European Parliament. During this whole procedure, my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, has played a constructive and pragmatic role with a view to finding a result that we hope the European Parliament will be able to endorse.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the international obligations deriving from the TBT Agreement and following the Council’s request of 23 April 2007, the Commission sent the file to the WTO, setting a two-month period for comments. This notification was formally made on 1 June 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards vodka, the Commission still has some reservations at this stage, which are primarily of a legal nature. The Commission has always taken a clear stance that it must ensure that a definition of vodka is compatible with EU law and fits the WTO context. The definition of the raw-material bases for this popular product – which is enjoying considerable market buoyancy worldwide – has been subject to considerable debate in the last month. The general approach of the Council distinguishes the labelling of vodka between one group based on potatoes and cereals, and those products which are derived from other raw materials which shall bear the indication ‘produced from’ and list the products that go into it. The Commission’s legal service has expressed concern about the compatibility of this solution both with EU law and with WTO obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any restriction of the present legislation needs to be duly justified and proportionate; the least intrusive way has to be found to serve this goal. So my colleague would like to conclude with these words: ‘For the time being, let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration, which I hope will be endorsed as a first-reading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months’ time’.</p>

    <intervention id="1-099" speaker_id="1930" name="Horst Schnellhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you all heard what the Commissioner said, which, I can honestly say, expressed my feelings exactly. All of us in this room heard it, and we shall take it into account during tomorrow’s vote, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">What was the starting point? When we held the hearing on 26 June of last year, we soon found that there were very great differences in the implementation of the Regulation. The Council was divided, Parliament was divided, and we really wondered how all this was to be overcome. I regard the fact that we have before us today a compromise involving the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament – after first reading, mark you – as rather sensational, considering the starting situation. It is a result for all those involved, and so I should like to thank the Commission, the Council and those fellow Members who have helped to work on it: Mrs McAvan, Mr Schlyter, and Mr Maaten of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to name but a few. Their cooperation was excellent, and indeed this is the only way of achieving a positive result.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not only did this come together at the drawing board, it was also the result of a clear vote in committee: 58 votes in favour to only 2 against, with 2 abstentions – that was a result we could build on. As the Commissioner said, many of Parliament’s proposals have been implemented. We already agreed back then that the quality of the Regulation had to be improved, it had to include more consumer information, and it had to be brought into line with the internal market. This Regulation was necessary. There had been two regulations and many Acts of Accession, but they could not achieve all this.</p>
      <p sl="de">How wonderful – there is no system of categories. We are not classifying spirit drinks according to quality – that would have been a very bad thing – but in the field of quality we do have a ban on flavouring spirits. This means that it is forbidden to add flavourings to spirits. I once said, exaggerating somewhat, that I wanted to see spirit drinks falling under the Regulation on spirit drinks, not containing so many chemicals that they ended up under the Regulation on chemicals. What is important, however, is the protection of producers who use proper methods, and we cannot allow – to exaggerate – the production of spirit drinks to become the preparation of toxic cocktails.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue of sweetening is another that was pushed through by Parliament. I should like to say to the Commission now that, when we discuss sweetening under the extended comitology procedure, we shall take great care that the addition of sugar is kept within reasonable bounds. Figures have been mentioned: 20 grams per litre, which corresponds to five teaspoons. I have to say that tea with five teaspoons of sugar added starts to lose its appeal! We shall keep an eye on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The methanol content of 50 grams per hectolitre in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre. This had been a health problem. The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has been reduced by 3 grams to 7 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol. These are achievements that cannot be praised enough. The new proposal also reflects traditional methods. We have been at pains to ensure, in particular, that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced. That is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moving on, now, to vodka: a very contentious issue. I could have lived with the Commission proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label; but the traditional producing countries, for example Poland and Finland, objected. I took account of these objections, which related to traditions, and said: in that case, we shall exempt potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement, and only the other agricultural raw materials used to produce vodka must be stated. That was the right solution as, when I look at the amendments that have been tabled and hear what the Commissioner has to say, I can already tell that all the amendments stating otherwise will fail to gain any support from within the Council, the Commission or the WTO. We are right to exempt these two products from the labelling requirement, in order to take account of traditions in Poland and Finland. We must not be tempted to introduce legislative amendments banning the manufacture of products when there is no basis for this in either health considerations or internal-market rules or consumer-protection rules. That would be taking things too far. We have always done things that way in previous legislation, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I would appeal to you to support the compromise tomorrow. There is no alternative compromise. Failure to adopt the present proposal will render all the other parts of the compromise invalid. The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas, which were strongly contested, the Council will start quarrelling again, and we shall have no regulation for the coming years. I should like to point that out so that no one tries to say later on that they would have voted differently if I had only told them that. That is the reason for my request. I look forward to the discussion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else.</p>
      <p sl="en">The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue. Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations, to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication, which is important, and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits. We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS, which ensures smooth running in the internal market, prevents fraud and counterfeiting, protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid, long-established industries, such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe – the United Kingdom – where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry. That is why we must support these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise, but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka, bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka, Finnish vodka, Swedish vodka, Lithuanian vodka, and so on.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we have to take decisions about food legislation and end up encroaching on territory which people and Member States believe to form part of their own individuality and tradition, then it has never been easy to reach sound agreements. The fact that Mr Schnellhardt has managed to do exactly that for this regulation on spirit drinks deserves the respect of us all.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need a fresh regulation, because the present one is no longer up to date, technologically speaking and because it requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and also further to the recent enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council, which will bring us better consumer protection, allow our European products to occupy a clearly defined position on the global market within the WTO framework and also promote the smooth running of the internal market. Moreover – and this is not insignificant – it recognises, by means of labelling and the system of geographical designations among other things, the specificity of each product, although there are still doubts among some, not least in our group, about the vodka provisions. Here too, though, the rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that, if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes, this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name. In doing so, we are using techniques that have been used before with great success. Years ago, in relation to beer and chocolate, we held a similar discussion on traditions, values, interests of suppliers of raw materials and of large and small producers; when those discussions were over, we reached a compromise much like Mr Schnellhardt’s present compromise with the Council. This is why I would urge all those doubting Thomases among you to revisit the compromise and to give it your backing if possible.</p>

    <intervention id="1-102" speaker_id="2327" name="Linda McAvan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Socialist Group will be supporting the trialogue compromise and all its elements, as outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt. I should like to thank him for all his hard work and, like Mr Titley, his patience, because this has become a very complex dossier and one on which emotions have started to run high.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are supporting this compromise because we want the European drinks industry to have high-quality products for consumers and we want to protect our industry on the world markets. What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one country’s type of production an advantage over another country’s type of production. That is not the aim of the legislation. There is room for all European producers, as long as they meet high quality standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the vodka compromise. I think it is a good compromise. Why? Because, as Mr Schnellhardt has said, for the first time it recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes. But, at the same time, it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market – and they will be labelled.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot have a situation as proposed by some of the amendments which seek to take certain European producers off the market. That would never get a majority in this House and would never get a majority in the Council. Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also got to work with facts. It is simply not true that the compromise on vodka would allow you to make vodka, for example, from animal waste, as has been circulated again in this House today. That is not true. It is made from very high-quality agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say something to the British Conservatives about vodka. I understand from their press release last week they are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river. I have to say that this is vital for European jobs, it is vital for the drinks industry, which employs 60 000 people, and has the support of British industry as well as European vodka producers and other drinks manufacturers. I can see surprise from some Members. I hope we will have this clarified because I have the press release here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it is not just about vodka, it is about high-quality drinks. Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt, myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production. All those things have been met. The Council and the Commission have been very helpful and I very much hope that tomorrow, after, as Mr Titley has said, 18 years have passed since we started trying to get this legislation on the statute book, we just go ahead and do it and protect European jobs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka, which is unfortunate, because it is a report that says so much more in many areas that are so crucial to Europe and to this industry in Europe. This is why I should like to single out a number of those other points.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The directive’s first concern is, of course, the quality of the European drinks industry. It also says something about Europe, because wherever you go in the world, we see European drinks, distilled in Europe, available in all shapes and sizes, and with a recognition of the quality which we produce in Europe. This is important in a situation in which not everything that is said about Europe is always positive, because this is something in which Europe excels. What the rapporteur has done is to reinforce this very element, more so, it has to be said, in his original report than in the compromise which was eventually struck with the Council. It is, to my mind, a fantastic achievement and something we should hold onto.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Distillation is a craft, a truly traditional craft. Anyone who visits distilleries – and I recently visited some gin distilleries in my own country – can see for themselves that it is a craft. It is an art to make these products well and in a way that the quality is retained at all times. This is without a doubt the most important element in this report. Rather than adding sugar or flavourings at random, we have clear definitions for these drinks, even very strict definitions, not least at the industry’s request. This is how consumers receive sound information about the product. They know what they buy, and can rely on the fact that what they are getting is quality. This directive also allows the European drinks industry, thanks to this quality, to remain a strong contender in the competition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It also says something about Europe, namely about the regional origin of many of these drinks. In this respect, this directive is almost like a microcosm of the European Union, as it demonstrates the diversity of the European Union and how we together, in this very diversity, can all still be European. This too is very important to my mind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will now briefly turn to the subject of vodka, on which the rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise which received my wholehearted support during the discussion. He has, as I see it, made a valiant attempt at trying to strike a sound compromise between the old vodka industries in the European Union, which existed at the time the definition was drafted – even before Sweden, Finland, Poland and all the other countries joined the Union – and these more recent Member States, and has done a reasonable job of it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Despite this, most of my group are in favour of a much stricter definition of vodka, and I have to say that their arguments are valid. This is why it is good that this issue is on the table, so that it can be thrashed out. Firstly, as regards consumer information, my group takes the view that every consumer must be able to rely on the fact that vodka is made from potatoes or cereals – these are of the essence – and sugar beet perhaps. As the majority in my group see it, consumers should be able to take this as read.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It goes further than this though. This is not just about the product. There is also a discussion about the individuality and identity of the countries where it is produced. After all, what would our reaction have been if this discussion with these countries had been held before? Would we have said: for the sake of consumer information, it is also possible to introduce onto the market cognac made from potatoes or whiskey made from grapes? No, of course we would never have done this, and my group wants us to be consistent in the case of vodka too. They have a point, of course.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to see us reach agreement at first reading. I welcome the fact that this argument is on the table, and in this respect, I support my group’s amendment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, objections have been raised concerning the proposal for a regulation on spirit drinks for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, broadening the definition of vodka to include spirit drinks based on raw ingredients other than those traditionally used infringes the law and is damaging to the economic interests of current vodka producers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, as a result of the proposed changes, the new Member States will yet again lose out. Poland, one of the main vodka producers in the European Union and the world, will be particularly affected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, this move will be yet another blow for farmers who grow cereal crops, potatoes and beet. They will not have the slightest chance of compensating for their losses with other crops.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, the name ‘vodka’ is a trade name, linked with a specific product that is manufactured according to a specific recipe and using specific ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses. Any product made from other raw ingredients will be a different product. Therefore, it cannot be labelled as ‘vodka’. It has to have its own, distinct name.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I wish, above all, to thank Mr Schnellhardt for the piece of work that we now have and that demanded so much patience. What patience we have all shown towards the lobbyists of the spirits industry! It will be a great relief to be rid of them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This package is really all about we politicians regulating sales advantages through origin marking and similar measures. That being said, I nonetheless think that even when it comes to spirits – which are not in themselves useful products that politicians should encourage – origin marking and similar measures may have a large role to play in defending local patterns of production against unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What I think we have so far forgotten to talk about in the debate is the work we have done to reduce the sugar content of spirits and the use of synthetic flavourings and colorants. That is also an important aim of the compromise: to produce a smaller quantity of synthetic spirits.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We now move on to vodka. Incidentally, I have tabled an amendment, number 149, designed to stop all traditionally unsweetened types of spirit from being sweetened. Let us return to vodka, however. The compromise arrived at states that grain and potatoes are the basis for vodka and that the product should be labelled accordingly if it is made of anything else. If producers begin to cheat where labelling is concerned and try to evade the issue and sell non-traditional vodka as ordinary vodka, we shall have to come back to this issue, as it is not intended that they should do that. If vodka is made of anything other than grain or potatoes, this must be stated on the bottle.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Sugar beet has been added in the amendments designed to afford still more protection to vodka. It is not traditional in my country to make vodka from sugar beet. Why should I support amendments that add sugar beet and put it on a par with grain and potatoes? I am therefore voting against those amendments.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his sterling efforts in drawing up this report. I feel that he was able, despite initial difficulties, to strike a balance, and reach a compromise in terms both of technology and of the various national interests. I should like to highlight two points, the first of which is the definition of vodka.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In our proceedings in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety I have already said that we should not succumb to the pressure that has been brought to bear by the so-called traditional producers. It is my firm belief that the argument so often put forward that we should have the same precise definition of what raw materials vodka can be made from as we do for whiskey and rum, is not entirely valid. After all, the technology of vodka-making is completely different. I therefore feel that the current definition of vodka is workable and sufficient. With regard to the current situation and to the opinions of the traditional producers, I feel that the compromise definition in point 145 of the report could be a solution, and as shadow rapporteur I recommend that at least some MEPs from my group should support it.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I cannot finish without mentioning the definition of slivovice, a specific issue for the Czech Republic. Mr Schnellhardt knows that there was a technical oversight, and that the Committee on the Environment …</p>

      <p sl="nl">I am delighted that the point that I have mentioned during the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been accepted. It concerns the ambiguous clause of creating the impression that there is mention of a certain age on the label. I am pleased that this clause has now been scrapped, because in this way, the Dutch young gin and old gin remain safeguarded. Indeed, this indication of gin refers to the preparation method of the gin and not the age.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off with a brief comment about vodka. Whilst I, as a Dutchman, am not used to drinking much vodka, I do sympathise with my Eastern European colleagues. This is why I have decided to back the vodka definition in which only potatoes, cereals and sugar beet can be used as raw materials. Further to the rapporteur’s appeal, I will give this matter some more thought.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome the fact that our discussion here and now on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks is based on a workable compromise that is clearly suitable for preserving tradition and the typical national means of producing spirit drinks across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I should like to make a few observations on a related problem. The age at which people are starting not only to smoke but also to drink alcohol has fallen. In the case of the former, the EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and also campaigns to strengthen young people’s self-confidence. It is time we did the same in the case of the latter, in my opinion. What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned, and will probably not make any difference to the problem. For example, the introduction of a special tax on alcopops only led people to switch to beer and to wine-based pre-mixed drinks, which explains why the number of young people drinking themselves into a coma has not gone down.</p>
      <p sl="de">Young people are probably not drinking any more than before; the reasons for alcohol consumption have not changed. What are significant, however, are the break-up of social structures such as the traditional family, the increasing isolation of young people in front of the television or computer screen, and often the lack of alternatives.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() First of all, let me express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his work on this topic. I would also like to praise the work of several Polish Members in connection with the drafting of amendments aimed at protecting the vodka tradition, which has long been a speciality of Eastern European countries. These amendments were also aimed at protecting customary, time-honoured methods of production which date back to the 15th century, and which should be employed in accordance with the traditions of the countries that were the first to produce such beverages.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The biggest 'apple of discord' in this report is the definition of vodka, namely what ingredients the beverage must contain in order to be designated as vodka. Throughout the centuries, vodka has been defined in Eastern European countries as a spirit made from grain, potatoes or sugar-beet molasses. To reiterate the point, since vodka is a speciality of the countries of Eastern, rather than Western, Europe, I would ask my colleagues from other countries to respect the definition and not to expand it to include citrus-flavoured spirits, etc. These and different spirits, which are the specialities of other countries, need another designation, primarily to prevent attempts at misleading customers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() Member States rightfully take pride in the fact that long-established methods of production and processing raw materials are respected, recognised and protected when applied to traditional designations, such as cognac, champagne, Scottish whiskey, rum, port wine, etc. These are conventional terms, and it is natural that manufacturers have clear definitions of the technological processes used in production and, similarly, of the primary raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is only natural that manufacturers from traditional countries of origin jealously and carefully guard these definitions. For that reason, Slovak producers, for example, had to replace the word 'rum' with a different designation, because the Slovak beverage was not made from sugar cane using the original method. In other words, manufacturers from the new Member States paid their harmonisation dues long ago. Now we are facing a situation where it is mostly the EU 15 Member States that must show that they can behave in a fair and proper manner and consistently comply with the same requirements that in the past were imposed on us. The matter at hand is vodka, as has been discussed here. All of a sudden we are witnessing a requirement to designate as vodka second- and third-rate spirits made of bananas and other fruits.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Consumers will then be misled into believing that they are drinking vodka and will stop buying the genuine product. This will harm the bona fide producers that follow the tradition and make vodka exclusively from the appropriate raw materials. Ladies and gentlemen, in Finland, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and all other Scandinavian countries, the designation vodka may traditionally be granted only and exclusively to a product made from either grain or potatoes. Therefore, I ask you to take this into account and to subscribe to these arguments during the vote.</p>

European legislation should therefore not in any way restrict these traditions and customs and certainly not prohibit them.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my country, the Czech Republic, slivovice is one of the traditional drinks. Maintaining traditional methods of producing slivovice is guaranteed under the country’s treaties of accession to the EU and should therefore not be undermined, certainly not by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support Amendment 144 tomorrow in the vote, and to rectify the mistake that has crept into the report.

Unfortunately, the solutions put forward in this report have been universally criticised, and satisfy no one.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Products have been artificially divided into three categories, where the vodka category contains no vodkas. Instead, this group includes brandy, whisky, rum, aquavit, and could easily also include our bootleg or moonshine vodka. Splitting alcohols up according to specific names gives the impression that we are involved in subliminal advertising rather than trying to find a solution to this problem.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a Scots MEP I have an obvious interest in any regulation that relates to whisky. However, we also have other national drinks, including a very significant economic interest in vodka and gin distillation and bottling. The debates in which I have taken part in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been interesting, at times heated, and I have argued strongly for a flexible definition of ‘vodka’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some say that spirits should be treated the same, but vodka and whisky are not the same, and this proposal simply has to recognise that fact. Vodka has traditionally been made from different ingredients in different areas; Scotch whisky is a product of centuries of traditional practice, by contrast. The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 1494/95. The first taxes were imposed in 1644.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some spirits have traditionally been rounded off using sugar. Scotch whisky has not, and this regulation must not allow that to happen. Protecting the term ‘Scotch whisky’, as well as the methods of production under geographic definition, is extremely important for Scotland for obvious reasons. Some details still have to be underlined in the technical files, and I look forward to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this first-reading compromise – the product of lengthy and very heated exchanges – is something that, in the spirit of that compromise, I am now prepared to accept, and I hope that the House will accept it tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We are now to adopt a definition of vodka. My question is: why? As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I wish to devote all my time and energy not to defining varieties of spirit but to working for a better environment and better public health.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Public health is genuinely threatened. Europe is far and away the continent on which more alcohol is consumed than anywhere else in the world. In my own country, Sweden, consumption has increased by more than 30% since we became Members of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">All that a definition sanctioned by the EU will do is paint a picture of vodka as something desirable. It is not desirable. Vodka is a form of alcohol, which is dangerous in unduly high quantities. If there is to be a definition of vodka, cannot the industry itself come up with it?</p>
      <p sl="sv">With all due respect to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, the business of coming up with a definition of vodka should be referred back to the place where most of it is produced and where the manufacturers can sit and produce as many definitions as they like. We politicians have other things to do.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to put aside my prepared text and respond to some of my colleagues who spoke earlier in the debate. Mrs McAvan tells us that this measure is designed to protect jobs, yet to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word ‘vodka’ for existing brands and existing manufacturers, it seems likely to have exactly the reverse effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Maaten asks if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry. Well, Mr Maaten, yes I have. I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry, but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this talk about consumer protection is nonsense. The product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky – or brandy, as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber – is because in those products, the ingredients significantly affect the flavour. Whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way, but vodka is based on pure alcohol.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I may make a general point, we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation. However, in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it. As happens so often in the European Union, we have to make the best of a bad job.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Mr Helmer has pointed out, and just to clarify for the House, the UK Conservatives are indeed supporting Mr Schnellhardt’s amendment on vodka. The issue which our Scandinavian and Polish colleagues appear to be banking on now is the old equality-with-whisky argument.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard people in the House this evening saying that that we could possibly have a situation where whisky is going to be made out of grapes. Well I have to say that these arguments are completely bogus. We are trying to define these products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be. As distillers will tell you, if you distil at a lower alcoholic strength, more taste comes over the still. Spirits like whisky are distilled at a low strength and derive their taste from the raw materials. Other spirits like vodka are distilled at a high strength and may then even be filtered through charcoal to remove the taste of the raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways. They are asking us to define a product not by reference to its characteristics or by reference to what the consumers expect, but by reference to the raw materials that their producers currently use. It is interesting that they have not sought to include sulphite waste, which was the predominant raw material in Sweden in the 1920s, nor apples, nor coal and yellow turnips, which have all been used in Poland in the past. Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition. We should be protecting the consumer, and it is for that reason that we support the approach being taken by Dr Schnellhardt, which avoids artificial restrictions on production while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed.</p>

      <p sl="de">We should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new Member States. Nor is it about good versus bad alcohol, or about capital versus labour. It is about our producing a new version of the Regulation on spirit drinks to adapt it to the current state of affairs. This means we want our consumers to be offered good, correctly labelled products.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the discussion is now reduced to the vodka issue, we must ask ourselves, firstly, if this is justified and, secondly, what is behind this.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very presumptuous, however, to assert that, if alcohol is distilled so much that it loses all taste, the starting point of the raw materials is crucial to the product’s designation. Therefore, we would do well to simply adapt to the state of affairs prevailing in Europe – that vodka is already being produced everywhere, even if it may have had its origins in Poland – rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should bear in mind that we have achieved a great deal.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1989, when the definition and labelling of alcoholic beverages was introduced, there have been many changes. Some traditional spirit-producing countries have become members of the European Union.

It is from the North that the name vodka derives from, and the traditional methods for manufacturing this spirit.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Traditionally, vodka has always been manufactured from grain. In some places it is also made from potatoes and sugar beets. Now that traditional vodka-producing countries have become EU members, we would like to see that namely alcoholic spirit beverages made from grain, potatoes and sugar beets be called vodka and be labelled as such.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the debate on the labelling of alcohol I should like to inform the House of a problem that is overshadowed by the debate over vodka, but that has particular significance for the citizens of the Czech Republic in economic, political and cultural terms. I refer to slivovice a traditional Moravian alcoholic drink made from fruit, most commonly from plums. This drink came under threat when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Feed Safety most unfortunately meddled in its definition, which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic. I feel that this was done by mistake rather than deliberately, but it is an unfortunate example of politicians’ meddling.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Because mistakes must be rectified, I would call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment on slivovice, on which I worked with Mr Horst Schnellhardt and which almost all groups have said they will support. I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his willingness to reach solutions that would return the definition of slivovice to a model that corresponds to its traditions. In the same way that Scandinavians closely follow the development of vodka, it is a priority for Czech people that slivovice should continue to take the form of a pure fruit spirit so that the characteristic flavour is not distorted by the addition of various ingredients.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Last but not least, there is a political dimension to all of this which should not be overlooked and which arises from the fact that the definition of slivovice became part of the accession negotiations and was enshrined in the Accession Treaty. The violation of an Accession Treaty would undoubtedly lead to a breakdown of trust between the EU institutions and the Member State concerned, not to mention the fact that a dangerous precedent would be set, which, in some cases, might affect other Member States. Given that our citizens take a lively interest in the fate of slivovice, our lawmakers should show a similar interest. Let us therefore take a much-needed step towards protecting slivovice by adopting the amendment in question.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although the report on the labelling of spirit drinks deals with over 30 different kinds of beverages, I would like to focus on the most controversial issue, namely that of the definition of vodka. The currently binding definition of vodka was drawn up many years before the main vodka producers joined the European Union. Thanks to them, the European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world. Parliament should therefore adopt a definition of vodka that would secure the reputation and leading market position of this spirit drink.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Maintaining the current definition of vodka and allowing it to be produced from waste material will lower its quality and have a negative impact on its reputation. The trade name ‘vodka’ should be reserved only for vodka that is produced from traditional ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses. This was the definition adopted by the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Vodka made from ingredients other than the ones traditionally used should be given a specific market name, such as ‘non-traditional vodka’, ‘vodka-style spirit drink’ or ‘non-standard vodka’, with the name of the raw ingredients used in its production clearly stated on the label. If this is not done, we will be cheating both ourselves and the consumers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, since a lot has been said about whisky and vodka, I shall say something about rum, which is produced in only two places within the European Union, those being the French overseas départements and Madeira. Since a great deal of it is drunk throughout Europe, it is imported from numerous third countries, primarily from ACP countries which enjoy special treatment under the 2000 Cotonou Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Rum is one of the overseas départements’ main export products, and the sugar cane rum industry alone accounts for over 40% of the value of exports from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion, and for 40 000 jobs created there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where the Community’s definition of rum is concerned, then, a great deal is at stake; rum from the French overseas territories needs to be defined in a way that makes it possible for it to be better distinguished from its third-country competitors, specifically by describing it as ‘agricultural rum’ derived exclusively from sugar cane juice, something that consumers recognise as a sign of quality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is no less important, in the eyes of the ACP countries, that this definition be consistent with the EU’s overall approach to their rum industry if their growth is to be sustained and if the progress made to date by the Caribbean producers is not to be jeopardised. It was with this in mind that the professional bodies representing producers in the French overseas départements and in the Caribbean countries agreed, in October 2006, at La Barbade, on a common position on the Community definition of rum, taking as the basis for it a generic definition and going on to draw progressive distinctions between traditional rum, agricultural rum and rum refined from sugar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for taking on board my request for an adequate definition of agricultural rum and for finally deciding to include in his report the definition of it already to be found in the Council’s compromise text. It has been a considerable amount of work, over a long period of time, on the part of the whole industry that has made it possible to promote the production of agricultural rum, so that the denomination, today, is one of the principal guarantors of this French overseas product’s entry onto commercial markets, and it is this that makes it possible to hope that the compromise submitted today for this House’s approval will be adopted at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="sv">If the compromise disintegrates, there will be no special status accorded to vodka made from potatoes or grain, and consumers will still be unclear as to what they are getting when they buy vodka.</p>

      <p sl="en">The second is equal treatment: when we joined the Union in 1995, we were told that vodka would have a tight definition, just like rum, whisky or grappa, or in line with some of the more traditional geographic definitions, for instance, of champagne and cognac. We therefore want equal treatment for vodka. We do not want it to be some kind of alcoholic waste basket.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third is consumption and production: we know what we are talking about – seven countries produce 70% of the vodka and consume 70% of the vodka.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The production and consumption of alcohol are probably as old as humanity itself. Hieroglyphics 4-5 000 years old in Egypt and clay tablets in Mesopotamia prove how active the ancients were in this area too. Following on from the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman god Bacchus, the tradition of spirit production was given a new boost during the Middle Ages by Christianity. The technologies used have improved, while the concepts and labelling have become more precise.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In my country, Hungary, pálinka, a 100% fruit brandy, was already established as part of our gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance. In fact, those technologies and products, the unchanged combination of which we can still enjoy today, were already established across Europe roughly 2-300 years ago. However, over the last 50 years, business, advertising and, later on, consumer society itself have completely muddied the clear picture we had up until then. The chemical and distilling industries nowadays are continually creating new tastes and aromas, offering an amazing selection of drinks. At present, you can basically make everything from anything. This has also been accompanied, of course, by traditions being watered down. There are already fewer and fewer people who know what it is worth drinking, why and when.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen! I am conservative when it comes to my political views and gastronomic habits too. I like things to be exactly what they are, and not what adverts want you to believe they are. This is why I am in favour of a strict definition for every drink, including vodka as well. Pálinka is made from fruit and vodka from grain, potatoes or sugar beet. It is all perfectly clear like this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If we blur the defining lines, we are not just affecting quality, development and our traditions, but we are clouding further the already murky picture. In that case, we can easily take the approach George Orwell’s hero did in ‘1984’, when he cannot say what he is actually drinking.

The second aspect – adapting the regulations to new technical requirements and to the requirements of the WTO and of TRIPS – will also be a success. The third objective – the continued validity of existing geographical indications, which can continue to be supplemented in future by additional designations – will also be achieved. With some give and take on the part of the individual Member States, that, too, will provide clarity in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for the effort he has put into the many difficult negotiations. In the dispute over ‘Jägertee’ or ‘Jagertee’, Germany has compromised and accepted the term ‘Hüttentee’ as the German designation. All parties must be prepared to take a step closer to one other.</p>
      <p sl="de">A great deal of tradition is involved, but mutual tolerance is required. By way of explanation, the term ‘Champagne’ refers to the designation of origin – that is, the regional origin – and has less to do with the ingredients. In Germany, we order a ‘Klarer’. By this we mean a spirit made from agricultural produce: fruit, grain or potatoes. We have taken steps towards ensuring the clear nature of this product, and towards maintaining the economic base of the traditional, often small, distilleries. I believe that this, too, will succeed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The addition of sweeteners must be regulated, and must be clearly visible on the label. For centuries, our distilleries have been producing top-quality spirits without adding flavourings or sugar. Labelling constitutes consumer information and ensures a level competitive playing field. This also goes for the raw material.</p>
      <p sl="de">We made very heavy weather of the definition of ‘vodka’. The solution – labelling everything that is not produced from potatoes or grain – is a workable compromise and provides clear information, and I ask you to support this compromise.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, first of all, perhaps I can provide you with some information which has not been presented to the House. Last week, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur. Why was the proposal rejected? The reason was that the group did not agree, by a small majority but a majority nevertheless, with the proposed definition of vodka contained in this proposal. By the same token, there was majority support for acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain, potatoes or beet molasses. This was the amendment that I tabled together with my colleague Mr Stubb, and I appeal to you to support it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Why this talk of tradition? I would like remind you that countries, or representatives of countries, which have nothing to do with the tradition of vodka production, cannot behave like the conquistadors who came to South America and stole Mayan gold. This is our tradition, the tradition of the vodka-producing countries, and it should be acknowledged in the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should be aware that the Council has also put unprecedented pressure on the European Parliament. A high-ranking official sent a letter to the representatives of 24 Member States and not only referred to the position of the influential lobby group the European Vodka Alliance, but also failed to send this letter to the representatives of two of the countries most involved in this dispute, namely Poland and Lithuania. The opinions of the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Economic and Social Committee were not taken into account. COPA – COGECA, the European Union farmers' organisations, and the European Union farmers themselves, all support the traditional definition of vodka. Why is this the case? The reason is that European potatoes and grain, as well as five hundred years of tradition, should define the value of this product. It should not be changed simply due to pressure from lobby groups.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We demand equal treatment. Traditionally produced vodka cannot be compared to other similar spirits. That would be contrary to the basic operating principles of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. I consider it to be an excellent piece of work. This report and this debate have, to say the least, provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members, between groups and within groups. I believe that we should support the compromise that has been reached. There are other proposals, but they cover what one specific viewpoint holds to the detriment of the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product. Additives are and must be controlled, but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time. We have to be aware of the needs of the spirit industry, as well as of consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">As some have said, this has turned out to be a complex report, with some very strong and different points of view, but we must have an acceptable agreement. Compromise agreements sometimes dilute the original intention of the directive, but on this occasion I believe that this is the best we can achieve at the present time. This is a very important and serious subject and we must get it right. The debate on what vodka is has removed some of the importance of this directive and that is unfortunate, but that sometimes occurs in politics.</p>
      <p sl="en">I listened to the different contributions and to my two colleagues from Scotland who protested that they have the longest-standing whisky. Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a little product called Bushmills and we would probably have a good debate as to who actually owned the oldest whiskey on the island of Ireland! I shall conclude on that note.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner, I am draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has been the advisory committee for this proposal. We were almost unanimous in adopting a clear definition to the effect that vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain. It was also the intention that there should be extended cooperation on this matter between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is not something we have seen much of in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
      <p sl="da">Vodka is a quality product with a very long history, and this is something we should safeguard. We should safeguard vodka production in exactly the same way as we safeguard the production of whisky, cognac and all other spirits in Europe. What I fail to detect in this Parliament is any respect for those people and countries possessing a culture that includes vodka production. It must also be on the basis of short-term interest that vodka is manufactured as an undefined product and as a dumping ground for surplus ingredients. The notion, current in recent years, that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived. Consumers want information, more information and yet more information.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should like to close, Madam President, by thanking once more the rapporteur, who has had a difficult job to do but who has managed to put before us a compromise which – if I rightly understand all that has been said in the course of this debate – is capable of being widely accepted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me come back to one of the issues raised, although I agree that this has somewhat overshadowed the very important elements in this piece of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As expected, the compromise text on vodka was mentioned several times. At the beginning, I said that the Commission had reservations. Those concern the legal basis and not the content of the compromise text. From a technical point of view, the Commission fully endorses the compromise because, in our opinion, it strikes the right balance between the traditional vodka producers and those that produce vodka from other raw materials. It is a fact that many producers have produced vodka legally for many years from raw materials other than potatoes and cereals, and the Commission cannot ignore the legitimate rights and expectations of those producers, as you will understand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, we have also listened carefully to the arguments highlighting tradition and quality. The Commission is not deaf to those arguments. I think that the compromise found strikes the right balance and, apart from some legal aspects, therefore has the Commission’s full support. Having said that, the Commission will continue to contribute constructively to the final adoption of this proposal, as soon as the underlying conditions are met.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The debate on the Regulation on spirits has culminated in an issue which the Commission pooh-poohed in its proposal: the equal treatment of vodka alongside other strong drinks.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It would be more accurate to say, however, this is about the equal treatment of European cultures. Apart from the fact that the debate on now reminds us of the existence of a European multiculture, it also at the same time shows that there is still much work to be done in the name of unity which respects differences.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The definition of vodka we are wrangling with is in fact a technical amendment to something we already knew about and found to be good: for centuries vodka has been manufactured almost entirely from grain and potatoes. In the EU 90% of all vodka has also been produced from these raw materials. When it comes to defining the ingredients, it is therefore not just a question of the interests of manufacturers and artificial market barriers, but of tradition. The vodka-producing countries, in which 70% of vodka is produced and consumed, do actually know what they are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The compromise by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, which in practice would permit the manufacture of vodka from any agricultural product, as long as there is a small mention of it on the label at the back, is inadequate. If we have to end up with a compromise, it should give greater support to the traditional manufacturing method.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU’s common identity and the legislation that supports that notion must be built on mutual respect, where historical facts are recognised. Our current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU, and so it needs to be updated. During the accession negotiations which Finland, Sweden, and countries which joined the Union later on, such as Poland, were involved in, the definition of vodka was passed over and promises were made to put that right in the near future. Now is that time.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0206/2007) by Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on EU economic and trade relations with Russia (2006/2237(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-141" speaker_id="1055" name="Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, the EU’s diverse relations with Russia are about to intensify: one only need look at the trade volume, the economic data and the investments – both by the West in the East and the other way round. Russia is our neighbour, it is about to join the WTO, it is a major energy supplier to the EU. All these are reason enough to draw up a report on the subject and get to the heart of the matter: where do we stand and where do we want to go?</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, it cannot be said that democracy, human rights, the rule of law or the freedom of the press in Russia have made progress in recent times. I had initially thought it would be possible to write a report that was more oriented towards practical politics; but we in the committee found – and I thank my colleagues for their support – that we did have to analyse some things critically. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and, as such, has subscribed to a good many things and, in particular, promised to ensure democratic conditions. I believe that the country needs reminding of these commitments.</p>
      <p sl="de">EU–Russia relations are currently in a difficult phase, as recent events have demonstrated time after time. I should like to quote Commissioner Mandelson, who said that the psychological legacy of the fall of the Soviet Union and the associated loss of superpower status were a great burden. What we celebrated as the triumph of freedom was seen differently in Russia. Russia’s political leadership has yet to learn how to deal properly with recent history. At the same time, however, it is true that the EU and Russia are dependent on each other. We need Russian gas and oil and, in turn, Russia’s economy depends largely on its energy exports. In addition, the Russian economy is in urgent need of foreign direct investment to enable its continued growth in future. The EU is by far its largest customer, and is also the main source of foreign direct investment in Russia. As such, we can expect our trade relations with this large country to be governed by the rule of law, reliability and predictability.</p>
      <p sl="de">How should the EU act in this situation? It is very important that the European Union adopt a common line and speak with one voice. If it agrees something with one of our Member States or fails to keep to an agreement, Russia is acting illegally towards the whole European Union. We cannot close our eyes to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now for my second point: Russia must create a better investment climate for European enterprises – not by changing its laws, but by better applying and, in particular, better enforcing these laws. The Russian legislation on intellectual property must be harmonised with international agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">One important point in our relations with Russia is the Energy Charter. Russia has signed it, but does not feel bound by it; which is regrettable. Without abandoning the Energy Charter, the EU should attempt to anchor the important elements of the Charter in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. It is to be hoped that the negotiations on this agreement will start shortly.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of Russia’s WTO membership, we realise that it is also in the interests of the EU that Russia become a member. This would mean Russia’s being subject to a whole sheaf of international obligations; which, in turn, would help make Russia a fully committed economic and trading partner rather than one that is able to cherry-pick. We should not accept this at all costs, however. In short, in spite of the dark side, we can look ahead to the future with optimism and confidence.</p>

    <intervention id="1-142" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on this excellent report. I also want to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation with the Commission when drafting this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the past few years, Russia has seen impressive economic development. This is partly due to high energy prices, but also, to a large degree, to a sound macroeconomic policy. Russia is becoming a more and more important economic player in the world. Growth of the Russian economy has averaged 6-7% since 1999; Russia has a considerable budget surplus, is an important destination for foreign direct investments and holds the third largest amount of foreign currency reserves.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not forget how important Russia is for the EU, and how important the EU is for Russia. In economic terms, the picture is quite clear: we are by far Russia’s most important trading partner and, in turn, Russia is our third most important partner. The EU is by far the most important investor in Russia. In short, we need each other and we need to work closely with each other; this is in our mutual interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is also clear that some problems exist. There are questions about specific issues concerning the business climate, for example the continued high levels of corruption. But there is also a range of specific issues, such as the ban on imports of agricultural products from Poland, the oil supplies to Lithuania via the Druzhba pipeline and the planned increases in export duties for wood. However, despite all these challenges, we should not forget that we also need to look at the overall situation and the very substantial opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report is thus very timely. It provides a comprehensive overview of the issues at stake in EU-Russia relations. Allow me to focus on four points concerning our economic relations that you also highlighted in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, you rightly insist on the importance of the rule of law. This is not only important for the economic operators that want to invest in Russia: it is also indispensable for the long-term economic and political development of Russia itself. What is really needed – and this is not specific for Russia – is sound and effective application of laws and rules, and a fully independent judiciary. Only this will guarantee a predictable and stable economic environment. Rules are the key to attracting investment. But we also need rules for other areas, such as intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point concerns the basis for our future cooperation. First of all, there is WTO membership, which is not an abstract aim in itself. WTO membership is the indispensable building block for successful and sustainable economic development. The Commission is working hard with Russia to achieve this as soon as possible, but we still need solutions for the outstanding issues. We also need to work towards launching negotiations on a new EU-Russia framework agreement to update the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. We should also consider a further deepening and strengthening of our bilateral trade and economic relations once Russia has acceded to the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I would like to thank Parliament for its support concerning the latest developments on Siberian overflight payments. The fact that we had a clear position and maintained unity on this issue led to a good result. The signature of the agreement – which has so far only been initialled – is one of our priorities. This issue needs to be resolved before Russia’s WTO accession. President Barroso made this point quite clear at the recent EU-Russia summit in May. On that occasion, the Russian Government confirmed its intention to sign the agreement in the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third point concerns energy. You rightly say in your report that the primary objective of EU energy policy cannot simply be to avoid continued energy dependence on Russia. We need fair rules, not politics – rules for predictability and certainty on both sides. The call for security of supply implies security of demand. Our aim should be to promote two-way investment by energy providers and consumers, upstream and downstream. In this context we also need to agree on clear, enforceable standards for energy transit, as well as other aims.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, allow me a comment on the area I am responsible for: competition. Over the past few years, the Commission has established close cooperation with the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly service. I believe we need to further strengthen this dialogue to identify areas where we can work more closely together and build on increasing convergence between our systems. Competition law is an essential feature of good economic governance. The new law adopted last October has given Russian competition policy the means to be really effective. Therefore, we will continue to work with the Russian competition authority in the context of the Common Economic Space and future bilateral agreements with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, allow me once again to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent and balanced report, which the Commission will certainly take into account in our ongoing and future cooperation with Russia.</p>

    <intervention id="1-143" speaker_id="1952" name="Jan Marinus Wiersma" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, listening to the rapporteur and also to the Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, I have to say that I can identify with both. I share the rapporteur’s concerns, but I also appreciate the Commissioner’s pragmatism, because it is indeed the case that economic relations between the EU and Russia are blossoming. As already stated, the EU is Russia’s most important trading partner and this trade continues to grow, just as investments continue to be made.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last weekend, a lot of good work was done during the economic forum in St Petersburg, and according to the reports, there was little evidence of the frosty atmosphere which prevailed during the EU-Russia Summit in May. We cannot see politics and economics in isolation from one another just like that, and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have focused on the political dimension of the trade relations and economic relations between the European Union and Russia. In doing so, I wanted to stress the political significance of economic relations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The economy has a bearing on political relations, and stronger economic ties can, in my view, contribute to the mutual atmosphere in which tricky political issues can easily be resolved. This does not happen of its own accord, though, as neatly epitomised, most of all, by the energy issue. It is, on the one hand, one of the most important pillars of the special political ties between the European Union and Russia, but at the same time, the current frictions indicate that agreements must be struck as a matter of priority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this context, we endorse Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation, which should contribute greatly to the transparency of Russian market rules and considerably improve the investment climate. At the same time, it should subject Russia to a number of rules that apply worldwide and thus reduce the risk of trade policy being used as a weapon. The Russians themselves realise only too well that they stand to benefit from good trade relations with the European Union. Economic relations very much underpin mutual political relations, and the growth potential is enormous.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This will also help Russia realise that it will have to find common ground within Europe, not least politically speaking. Not only in terms of trade, but also where human rights, democracy and dormant conflicts with common neighbours are concerned. It is absolutely vital that the right balance be struck here. The EU must enshrine these agreements in an improved agreement which is to supersede the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. This once again exemplifies the close relationship between the economy and politics.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the negotiations have run aground on account of a trade conflict which translates politically as a conflict between the European Union and Russia. In short, we are in favour of a pragmatic approach, but the political dimension cannot be seen in isolation from the economic dimension, even where trade relations are concerned.</p>

    <intervention id="1-144" speaker_id="4429" name="Robert Goebbels" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, since we know that geography has ordained that the European Union and the Russian Federation be neighbours, we have to see to it that these two political entities make their neighbourhood policies as cooperative as possible. In the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission is very much to be encouraged to negotiate with Russia with a view to concluding a regional free-trade agreement in line with WTO rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament is up in arms about Russia’s failure to ratify the Energy Charter or the transit protocol, yet Norway has not ratified these instruments either, so they will not enter into effect, and hence the relevance of a new strategic partnership agreement with Russia, on which, however, Poland, under the Kaczynski brothers, is standing in the EU’s way, something that is made all the more unacceptable by the fact that the need for a common energy policy is becoming more obvious from one day to the next. Because of the Polish veto, the EU risks missing a good opportunity to embark on negotiations that might produce results to the benefit of both sides.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe will become more dependent on Russian gas and oil, while the Russians, for their part, are in need of solvent customers since they will not be able to pipe their gas to Asia until 2012, when the Asian gas pipeline currently under construction is likely to be put into service. Moreover, half of Russia’s budget is dependent on earnings from the energy sector. Finally, Russia is in enormous need of investments in its energy sector in order to meet increasing demand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the conditions for a balanced agreement are therefore in place, but it is the Polish Government that is preventing any further progress in this matter, and this state of affairs will prompt the various Member States of the EU to sign more bilateral agreements with Russia, with both the EU itself and Poland losing out in equal measure.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, today, at a crucial moment, we are discussing a sound and important report. As the rapporteur already mentioned, Russia is one of our key trading partners, and she has the figures to prove it. There is, however, still a great deal of potential in our relations with Russia. In fact, if one considers the trade relations, there is a paradox: bilaterally, a number of Member States have good relations, but EU-Russia relations need to improve. Both partners should play a role in this, in fact. Accordingly, the Member States should find a common response to the challenges. This is why, Madam President, the negotiations about a fresh partnership agreement should start at the earliest opportunity. A fresh Treaty that is underpinned by the experience of the past decade and that also allows for a fresh dialogue to be held in the next few years. There are a number of important elements that should be included in this: reciprocity and transparency. This is what President Putin had to say at the economic forum in St. Petersburg two weeks ago:</p>
      <p sl="nl">‘Economic partners can feel a sense of security only when they have reliable and predictable relations.’</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is all well and good, but our entrepreneurs also want the security of being able to do business in a clear and legal framework. We need an improved investment climate which boasts transparent business conditions and where intellectual property rights are guaranteed. I therefore look forward with a great deal of interest to the fresh foreign investment act, and the Commissioner may be in a position to say something about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In fact, improved economic cooperation can also contribute to economic development that is diversified more effectively in Russia itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning to the subject of the WTO, I welcome this. This is the only way of tackling counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As everything has already been said about energy, I will not say any more on this subject. Madam President, I should only like to express my appreciation to Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl who, along with her colleagues, has done an excellent job.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, before I start, I consider it my duty to congratulate the rapporteur of the report on EU economic and trade relations with Russia. This really is an integrated, balanced and fundamentally realistic report, because it maps the present level of relations between the European Union and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="el">No one can dispute the specific strategic weight of Euro-Russian relations and the need for them to be developed and deepened. Circumstances dictate that Russia should be promoted to the position of a strategic partner of Europe. It is not simply the statistics on economic and trade relations that force us to move in this direction. Nor is it simply the fact that Russia has large stocks of energy resources. It is, above all, the very history and geography of the European continent which, even under present circumstances, impose the need for new, integrated and balanced strategic relations between Europe and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="el">These relations must be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. Euro-Russian relations must look towards the future, towards the joint challenges we have to address and towards the joint potential we can exploit in order to achieve security, stability, development and prosperity for our people and cooperation in resolving serious global and regional problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within this framework, we need to overcome the historic past of confrontation and mutual suspicion. We have a common need to work to establish a new climate of mutual trust. I point this out because clouds of mistrust, tension and crisis in our bilateral relations have already started to gather. No one has any interest in a new confrontation, in a new cold war, and this applies to both sides.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union needs to formulate a common strategic perception of Russia in all sectors of cooperation, to speak with a united voice and to express its solidarity collectively towards each Member State. However, it is in the energy sector that there is an urgent need to formulate a common European policy. I believe that only under this precondition can the European Union strengthen its negotiating power and prevent the energy dependency of individual Member States and the exploitation of energy resources as a political weapon by the Russian side.</p>
      <p sl="el">Important achievements have been made in relations between the European Union and Russia over recent years. Of course they were helped – and we should recognise this – by the far-reaching reforms and a new stable macroeconomic environment in Russia under the leadership of President Putin.</p>
      <p sl="el">One strategic priority must be to immediately start negotiations on a new strategic partnership and cooperation agreement.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing EU-Russian relations, we recall that Russia is a strategic partner of the EU. The EU exports 7.3% of its goods to Russia, while Russia exports 53% of its goods to the EU. It might appear that Russia is fairly dependant on the EU. However, 65% of the EU imports from Russia are energy-related. Some countries import 100% of their natural gas from Russia. In reality, the EU is dependant on Russian exports and its energy policy at a global, EU and domestic level.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Russia uses energy policy as a political tool, attempting to dictate its political conditions to former Soviet republics and EU Member States, particularly the Baltic States. For almost a year now a decision has not been made on repairing the Druzhba oil pipeline, which used to carry oil to Lithuania.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Russia is fragmenting the solidarity of EU Member States by offering bilateral energy supply projects which may be exploited for political purposes with sad consequences for common EU energy policy. I am referring to Nord Stream, the German-Russian project, which will make Germany directly dependant on Russian political interests and Blue Stream, which is envisaged to replace the EU-planned Nabucco project.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today we are considering the ideas put forward in the report, that the basic aim of EU energy policy cannot merely be the avoidance of energy dependency on Russia. I wish to stress that this should be the main means which would enable us to achieve one of the most important goals of the EU Common Energy Policy – energy security.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the Member States are involved in constructive cooperation with Russia. Regretfully, however, our report still finds that Russia is using trade policy instruments to achieve foreign policy goals in a way that is not compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The report is therefore to be commended for demanding that in talks on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement any retreat from the standards and requirements of the European Union’s values must not be allowed. Russia must understand and must provide transparent and predictable business conditions that are based on rigorous democratic values and trustworthiness. Without such requirements there is little hope that Russia will cease its discrimination against the Baltic States and other states in the region in the sphere of rail or timber export tariffs or in the restriction on exports of fish, meat and dairy products. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the pressing need to solve problems with the improvement of the infrastructure of the Latvian-Russian border-crossings.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report states, on the one hand, that EU-Russia relations are at a difficult and even critical phase, while conceding, on the other hand, that close cooperation is extremely important for both the Union and Moscow.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The solution, in my view, is as follows. The EU should, as a matter of principle, return to practical discussions not only on energy but also on other issues concerning economic relations with Russia, without prejudice and without any psychological baggage on the part of our leaders, in particular those of the new Member States. Russia is today economically stronger thanks in part to oil prices and therefore more assertive when it comes to its own interests, which is understandable. It is also worth pointing out that Russia is in an election campaign. It is taking many steps in other places with an eye to how they will be received at home. Nevertheless, not even Russia is free of the need to adopt a certain measure of arrogance in negotiations. Provided that both sides understand a number of other factors, such as the increasing economic strength and energy needs of China or India, there is still hope that we will be able to work together properly. Otherwise, both the Union and Russia will lose out.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, whilst the analysis of the problems of the economic and commercial relations with Russia is clear-cut, this report, however, fails to address in a satisfactory manner the question how Europe should arm itself against the growing politicisation of the Russian economy. In the absence of a clear response, Russia continues to strengthen bilateral relations with individual Member States. The enthusiasm with which these Member States take part in these betrays not only the incapacity to reach one European policy, but also the lack of political will.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report condemns Russia’s lack of anticipation with regard to WTO legislation. In the light of this, I am surprised at the fact that paragraph 15 should mention the possibility of a free trade agreement at this stage. I take the view that following Russia’s accession to the WTO, we should observe a period of consolidation in order to assess the effects of its accession. The Commission would do well to invest its efforts in an analysis of this kind rather than consider a free trade agreement at this stage.</p>

      <p sl="el">The ten-year partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia is an adequate foundation on which to build broader and deeper relations between the two sides.</p>
      <p sl="el">The stated objectives of creating four common areas must, in my opinion, despite the burgeoning confidence crisis, continue to be politically binding in the negotiating process for the new post-2007 framework.</p>
      <p sl="el">The establishment of an integrated and open market within the framework of a common economic area between the Union and Russia will feed and be fed by Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. To those who express reservations about Russia’s accession to the global trade system, I should like to point out that it is preferable for a market as huge as the Russian market to be integrated into the procedures, rules and disciplines of the WTO than to operate as a ‘free rider’.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should also like to add that the Union should take an initiative to start negotiations in the aim of the full integration of trade and investment in the energy sector into the multilateral trade system.</p>
      <p sl="el">Security of supply is an overriding priority for the Union and bilateral agreements between the Member States of the Union and Russia are being called upon to help here. The agreement between Russia, Greece and Bulgaria on the construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline is a contribution of strategic importance to European energy infrastructures. It has also been judged by the Commission as a plan of pan-European interest within the framework of the INOGATE programme.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we are discussing Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s report at a very difficult time. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia is virtually on ice. There are difficult relations between certain Member States and Russia. It is totally unclear what the outcome of the WTO negotiations will be. In this regard, too, there is frustration on many counts. The Free Trade Agreement that should be concluded after Russia’s accession to the WTO is a project that we have been envisaging for a long time but has been put off time and again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Wiersma and also Mrs Oomen-Ruijten raised an important point, and that is that we are in a strange situation. On the one hand, we are achieving economic integration and are sensing in the Russians an intensity and indeed a willingness to adopt Western standards in the field of investments and production facilities. On the other hand, in the political sphere, something is discernible on the part of Russia that could be described as either uncertainty or a craving for status.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is good to retain a healthy pragmatism, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has done in her report, and to say that we need and want these relations. Russia is our neighbour, it is an important political power, and it will continue to be an important political power in future. We also need it for the internal stability of the European region as a whole. Let us develop sound economic relations, therefore, including in the field of energy cooperation. I believe that this is the right course to take.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet we need something more, too, Commissioner, so that there is not always the risk of Russia’s using economic policy as a political weapon. We should develop sound mechanisms to foster genuine dialogue. These are finely tuned in relation to many other countries, in some cases very finely tuned, but in the case of Russia we are still at square one. Dialogue between our respective business communities, SMEs, political cooperation, civil society – all this is necessary for the development of a reliable democracy that does not fear that every conflict situation will immediately turn into a dispute.</p>

This is a problem faced by all the EU Member States, as we can see in the case of flights over Siberia. In spite of promises recently made by Russia, European airlines using Russian airspace still have to pay a special fee, which has nothing to do with the normal price paid for air traffic control services. This is a transit charge that is contrary to universally accepted practice, and contravenes international law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of Polish meat is similar. This meat meets all European Union standards but is not allowed onto the Russian market for reasons that have nothing to do with the market economy. Russian consumers are denied access to Georgian water or wine from Moldova for the same reasons. This behaviour is as cynical as the Gary Kasparov case. Mr Kasparov was arrested at the airport on his way to a protest which took place during the summit in Samar. He was detained long enough to be unable to reach his destination although, officially speaking, he had not been detained at all. That is how the Russian Federation authorities operate. Everything appears to be fine on the surface. However, appearances can be deceptive. Europe would do well to remember this.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, the EU calls itself Europe, but there is no geographical justification for that. For a huge part of Russia too is Europe. Russia is the neighbour of many Member States of the EU and our partner, therefore, in many areas, not just energy. I would like to bring your attention to the fact that the Russian economy is not just about energy. Only a third of its economic growth in the last few years is based on energy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia is about to expire. Just as 26 Member States are keen to develop economic and commercial relations with Russia, one country, Poland, is obstructing the process. We have to ask whether the critical trade problem it has would not be resolved in a more organised way through negotiation rather than by preventing the start of joint talks. Poland is preventing the EU from speaking with one voice. As someone representing a country which shares a border with Russia, I have to say that we can in fact take care of matters more successfully bilaterally rather than speaking with one voice.</p>

      <p sl="sv">That is why we have to work to promote increased trade with Russia and why we must make efforts to bring Russia into the World Trade Organisation. We must also send out the correct signals, however. Russia has recently suspended deliveries of coal and oil to Estonia. The aim was to force Estonia to yield to Moscow on an issue of domestic politics. The EU reacted feebly. Russian oil and gas for large EU countries were more important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">‘Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die Moral’ [‘Gorge ourselves first – morality later’] was the message. The EU did not make it clear enough that Estonia is an EU country and that the Russian measures were therefore directed against the whole of the EU - a state of affairs that is unacceptable to the EU.

      <p sl="sv">Right now there are a great many important issues on the agenda that concern the EU’s economic relations with Russia, especially the partnership agreement and the negotiations concerning possible Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the debate concerning economic relations with Russia, there appear to be two opposing extremes. On the one hand there are those who see Russia’s growth into a great economic power as a threat and who want to prevent this and make us independent of Russia. On the other hand, there are those who want to trade with Russia, at whatever price, and who are prepared to do anything to ingratiate themselves with the leaders in Moscow and to secure their own access to Russia’s natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I do not support any of these perspectives. We have a lot to gain from increased trade with Russia and increased economic integration. Russia has still more to gain, however. It is not only the economy with which we are concerned here. The fact is that trade brings us closer to each other and strengthens democracy and the rule of law in the countries concerned. In that way we would be establishing Russia firmly within the European community of interests.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must also make demands of Russia, however. We must demand that it respect democracy, the market economy and the rule of law. Too many people today appear to believe that Russia is fated to reject universal principles and they blindly accept that Russia is violating those principles. They are wrong to do so, however. To prostrate ourselves in the face of Russian pressure or provocation would lead nowhere. It would purely and simply weaken the forces for good in the country. If, on the other hand, we act together and form a united front in the EU, we shall make them listen. The fact is, they have to listen. Certainly, Russia is an important trading partner of ours, but what a lot of people forget is that we are a still more important trading partner for them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We should also demand that Russia become a member of the World Trade Organisation. It is important to bring Russia into the WTO, whereupon it would be integrated into rule-based world trade. However, we must ensure that they intend not only to be members, but to comply with the rules. The situation must not be like that in, for example, the Council of Europe, of which they became members only then not to concern themselves with human rights. That is a situation we cannot afford. The WTO cannot afford to have Russia act in that way.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last but not least, the European Energy Charter is relevant in this connection. I should like to go further into this subject on another occasion. It is one on which the EU must show a united front and force Russia to listen.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe needs stable Eastern borders, and it must be highlighted that on one important point we are in agreement with Russia: we do not want Russia to join the EU and nor does Russia want to join.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, economic relations between Russia and numerous EU Member States are increasingly important when it comes to energy, on which there need to be stable agreements and of which there needs to be a properly negotiated supply. There must also be negotiations to reach clear solutions on Russian investment in the EU. Companies from the Member States are making serious inroads into the sources of Russian energy supplies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">EU support for better balanced relations with Russia must be maintained. This must encompass not only external trade but also recasting European cooperation programmes such as the TACIS programme (technical assistance to CIS countries). Russia has financial, economic and human resources. Without wishing to preach to our partner from the East, which does not have extensive experience of political pluralism, strengthening trade with Russia can play a very positive role.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report before us makes a significant contribution to the debate on business and economic relations with Russia. We know that strengthening these relations will foster better mutual knowledge and can help break down social and regional inequality, especially when those relations are accompanied by frank and far-reaching dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also believe that accession to the WTO will lead to deeper economic integration between the EU and Russia. It is also necessary to foster a climate that is conducive to investment in Russia and to encourage the Russian Federation to ensure that their workers enjoy decent working conditions and trade union rights. Furthermore, it is necessary, of course, not only to support, but also to contribute towards, improvements to Russian law, in order to ensure that the law on protecting intellectual, commercial and industrial property rights is enforced.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, economic cooperation stands a chance of succeeding if businesses play an active role. Where politics and government, or the state, come into play as actors, there is a danger of the economy being used as a means to achieve political, or even military ends.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Now, for the first time, Russia may have sufficient financial resources to significantly increase its citizens’ income and improve their standard of living. However, will it use the profits from its minerals trade for this purpose or will it use them to attain military, or other goals instead? We have no idea. Every so often, President Putin surprises Europe with forceful statements, which make Western leaders tremble. We also have no idea how the Russian people will react to national assets being placed in the hands of a small group of advisors. We have to admit that it is very difficult to cooperate with an unpredictable partner.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What should we do in this situation? I think that we need to assure Russia that we want it to be a peaceful, economic and political partner and that we wish the Russian people a happy life, the quality of which meets European standards. However, in addition to this, we also have to ensure that Russia treats the European Union, and each of its members, as a friendly partner. However, it needs to know that this partner, namely the European Union, is also decisive and cohesive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Any partiality within the Union will tempt Russia to use a selective economic strategy, which is damaging to cooperation and to the cohesion of the Union. Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s report should send a signal to Russia that we follow healthy economic principles, that we respect our partners and expect the same in return. Only this kind of cooperation can help to increase citizens’ economic standards. Finally, I would like to say that if this criterion is not met, cooperation will not be possible. Instead, tensions will reappear. I hope that both sides understand this.</p>

Важният раздел за енергетиката следва да бъде разглеждан и като подкрепа на отделни споразумения на страни-членки на Европейския съюз с Русия, какъвто е случаят с петролопровода Бургас-Александруполис, който ще транспортира енергийни суровини. В този проект се включват две страни-членки на Европейския съюз, България и Гърция. Той е от изключителен интерес за страните, които са го подписали, но и за Европейския съюз като цяло. По тази причина проектът трябва да получи подкрепата на съюза. Много е важно, обаче, да се подчертае, че и Русия, и Европейският съюз трябва да направят сериозна оценка на въздействието на проекта върху околната среда и да вложат инвестиции в технологии за опазването й, тъй като петролопроводът преминава през чувствителната в това отношение Черноморска зона. Проектът ще носи икономически растеж за региона, но в никакъв случай не трябва да затваря други сектори, като например туризма, в зоната на Бургаския залив, през който ще се осъществява прехвърлянето на суровината. Трябва сериозно да се прецизира и трасето на петролопровода, да бъдат защитени пластове от културно-историческо наследство. Това ще повиши неговата обща сигурност.</p>
      <p sl="en">Подкрепата на Европейския съюз ще бъде гаранция за неговата перспектива с оглед устойчивото развитие на региона. Черноморската зона се явява изключително интересна за развитието на други отношения с Русия, каквито са икономическите зони. Това са инвестиции, в които ще се допринесе за голям икономически растеж, особено инвестициите в търговия и производствен капацитет. Сътрудничеството с Европейския съюз и Русия трябва да премине и през партньорство в създаването и прилагането на нови технологии, нови материали, които са от изключителен интерес и за двете страни.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, in relations with Russia we are constantly faced with the situation where fish products from the Baltic or meat from Poland becomes very unhealthy for the Russian public, which has a very healthy lifestyle. The same applies to oil pipelines — the technical conditions of these always deteriorate very rapidly in those situations when there is a change in ownership of oil processing businesses in the Baltic States. Rail tariff policy, for its part, has for many years now been making shipments of freight to ports in the Baltic Sea States up to 2.7 times more expensive than shipments to Russian ports. For that reason I believe that, in the WTO context, it is enormously important to achieve a situation whereby no type of discrimination whatsoever is permitted in trade relations between Russia and any European Union Member State, and particularly in those European Union Member States which Russia continues to regard as falling within its sphere of particular influence.

Una dintre aceste faţete, la care aş dori să mă refer, este poziţia geopolitică a Rusiei. După aderarea României şi Bulgariei, la 1 ianuarie 2007, graniţa de est a Uniunii Europene o reprezintă regiunea Mării Negre, din care Rusia face parte şi unde joacă un rol foarte important, atât din punct de vedere economic şi comercial, cât şi bineînţeles din punct de vedere politic. Regiunea Mării Negre este o zonă cu un potenţial de dezvoltare imens, dar în acelaşi timp o zonă care trebuie să găsească răspunsurile adecvate la provocările existente. Printre ele, asigurarea securităţii şi stabilităţii regiunii în ansamblu, dar şi a fiecărei ţări în parte, constituie prima prioritate. În acest context, găsirea şi aplicarea unei soluţii pentru rezolvarea conflictelor îngheţate este imperios necesară. Acesta continuă să fie un obstacol important în calea dezvoltării regionale şi a prosperităţii economice, iar poziţia şi implicarea constructivă a Rusiei în această direcţie trebuie să fie o tematică mereu prezentă în dialogul Uniunii Europene cu această ţară.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tot în contextul Mării Negre, dar şi separat de ea, trebuie abordată tema energetică. Aici trebuie punctat că relaţiile Uniunii Europene cu Rusia nu se pot dezvolta fără a ţine cont de necesitatea de a le baza pe încredere reciprocă, precum şi pe respectarea obligaţiilor internaţionale şi principiilor democratice de către ambii parteneri. Şi, pentru a introduce în context şi regiunea, cred că diversificarea surselor de energie trebuie să rămână o prioritate a Uniunii Europene.</p>

      <p sl="lt">On my way to Strasbourg, on the bus I read the Goldman Sachs forecast that in 40 years Russia's economy will be one of the strongest in the world, overtaking major European countries in terms of GDP per capita. This pro-Russian forecast might have some basis if Russia played by the time-honoured rules employed by the rest of the world in the fields of economy and trade, and if it tread the path of democracy, even if it is democracy with a Russian flavour.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, for the moment, it will be a long road – both in time and in terms of distance from what is really happening now – to the fulfilment of these predictions. Russia's economy may be growing impressively, but reforms are slowing down, corruption is not decreasing, and the legal system is not becoming any more reliable. The cases of Khodarkovsky and Lebedev, which will soon be re-opened, may become parodies of trials. Investors from Europe do not have the same adequate legal safeguards that the EU guarantees to investors from Russia.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Moscow’s penchant for adding hot political spices to the trade of petroleum, natural gas and meat causes concern. The new EU members experienced losses when Russia clashed with Ukraine and Belarus, cut off the supply of crude oil through the Druzhba gas pipeline because of alleged technical breakdowns, and has not cut the Gordian knot of the Polish meat import affair.</p>
      <p sl="lt">EU-Russian trade relations would be helped by a Baltic Sea cooperation strategy in the northern dimension context, especially in relation to the Kaliningrad area. The degree to which this area is closed or open is like a barometer showing the whole of Russia's intentions. At the moment the barometer shows ‘changeable’, because investment and trade guidelines for the area have not settled down, nor has taxation policy, and businessmen from EU countries working there do not feel safe.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nevertheless, one would like to believe, that one day the barometer will indicate ‘fine weather’. Mutually beneficial EU-Russian trade relations will help Russia achieve the favourable economic forecasts and become a good and reliable EU partner.</p>

Another of the report’s virtues is that it has been published at a point when Russia has been enjoying a run of good luck thanks to the increase in the price of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This has translated into a qualitative change in its attitude, as well as its economic and trade policy. Let me draw your attention to the most important features of these changes. The first is Russia's unwavering effort to control the markets and the transport of raw materials with the aim of using crude oil and gas as a tool to exert political pressure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second is Russia's policy of consistently offering special relations and privileges to some countries in the European Union while discriminating against others, in line with the principle of divide and rule. An example of this policy was the speech Mr Goebbels gave in this House. In spite of clear evidence to the contrary, he claimed, as a Russian spokesman would also claim, that Russia was in the right concerning its dispute with Poland. I applaud this bias.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To sum up the situation, Russia is consistently exploiting its favourable situation on the raw materials market to create an international economic and trade structure that will allow it to attain its political goals. The Union’s response to this kind of policy should be a decisive strategy based on speaking with one voice on all common issues and, in order to defend the weakest among us, working to protect and support those countries and economic sectors that are most dependent on Russia.</p>

First of all, between the end of 2006 and the start of 2007, the Member States of the European Union were in a position where their supplies of natural gas were threatened due to the dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Then, in January 2007, Russia suspended crude oil supplies to Western Europe due to a dispute with Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the moment, Russia is blocking the supply of crude oil to the Mazeikiu refinery, following its sale to the Polish company Orlen. These are unfortunately only a few examples of the way in which Russia uses the supplies of raw materials for energy production as a political tool against European Union Member States and third countries. It is also proof of Russia's unreliability as an energy supplier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, for over eighteen months there has been a ban in place on imports of Polish foodstuffs to Russia. It was only at the start of this year that the European Union decided to acknowledge that the problem affects not only Poland, but also the entire European Union. Unfortunately, although several months have passed and in spite of an ever increasing amount of evidence to prove that this embargo is purely political, even the European Union has not managed to resolve this problem. Therefore, I would like to express my hope that the European Union will not only be resolute, but also effective, in resolving this matter.</p>

      <p sl="pt">These are certainly difficult times for our relations with Russia. We have an obligation to try to improve this relationship. There is a path that can be found between ‘Realpolitik’, which tends to overlook principles, and what former French Cabinet Minister Hubert Védrine recently termed ‘Irrealpolitik’ in the field of international relations, which tends to overlook the complexity of a given situation. That path is one of tough, responsible pragmatism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I feel that this is the way forward proposed in this report and the way that I should like to advocate. It is a path that promotes stronger economic and trade cooperation and the creation of conditions whereby Russia can join the World Trade Organisation, a prerequisite for better integrating Russia into the international framework in this area. At the same time, this path must also be matched by resoluteness with regard to protecting and safeguarding fundamental rights, fundamental human rights, the fundamental principles of a democracy and the fundamental principles of the rule of law. It is in this balance that we must seek the solution whereby we can resolve the problems that still divide the EU and Russia before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and the interesting debate. I have taken good note of what you said and I will convey your message to my colleague Mr Mandelson for his consideration. I am sure that he, like me, will be impressed by the high degree of consensus in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rather than going into detail on the different points raised this evening, I should like to say the following. It is true that many problems exist and our relations are complex. However, this is not surprising given the enormous depth and breadth of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In spite of a number of difficult issues, we should not forget that our cooperation with Russia is very successful on many issues. I have already referred to the example of competition policy, where we have established good cooperation, and we have made good progress in aligning our regulatory systems. There are many other examples that I could refer to.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is also clear that we need to tackle the challenges in our relations. We want to work actively with Russia to find solutions to the outstanding issues and we need constructive engagement: only an active dialogue with the Russian side, including on the difficult issues, will allow us to find solutions that are in our mutual interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several Members asked when the EU will be ready to start negotiations on the new agreement. Negotiations on the new agreement will take place as soon as we have the mandate from the Member States. The Commission is working actively with the Presidency, the Member States and Russia to overcome the remaining difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">We and Russia have an interest in a new EU-Russia agreement to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, as our relationship with Russia has developed over the last decade. A new agreement would take relations to a new level and enable them to reach their full potential. However, there is no time pressure: the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement remains in force and the ‘common spaces’ roadmap provides us with a substantial agenda for the short and medium term. There will be no legal vacuum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Foltyn-Kubicka and Mr Seppänen mentioned Polish meat. The Commission is working with Poland and Russia for the lifting of the Russian ban on imports of Polish meat and plant products. We have been very active at all levels to demonstrate to Russia that Poland fully complies with EU legislation and EU-Russia documents concerning veterinary and phytosanitary issues and that the bans should therefore be lifted. Discussions will certainly continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Budreikaitė and Mr Paleckis raised the question of the Druzhba pipeline. The Lithuanian Government has raised this issue. The Commission has kept in close contact with the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Kristenko, and we are urging the Russian authorities to provide Lithuania with full information on the state of the pipeline so that a satisfactory solution can be found.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several Members spoke more generally about EU-Russia energy relations. Energy is an area which demonstrates our interdependence. Russia needs European markets, investment and know-how just as much as Europe needs Russian oil and gas. We continue to believe that the Energy Charter Treaty offers a good multilateral framework for international trade and investment in energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the most recent summit, a decision was taken to establish an early-warning mechanism. This can help make EU-Russia energy dialogue more operational. Energy will obviously have an important place in the new EU-Russia agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As President Putin assured us at the last summit, Russia respects the key principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and we expect them to be reflected in the new agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked about developments in Russian investment law. I have to make it clear that this is at present a draft law, covering strategic sectors of the economy. The Commission is following the developments closely. We will soon start an investment dialogue with Russia and we will be able to discuss this with you further.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the question of the rule of law, human rights and democracy, I can assure you that the Commission will continue to press the importance of respect for common values and will ensure that the new agreement also reflects these values.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for an excellent report. We will take it into account as much as possible in our work with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0176/2007) by Mrs E. Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Competition Policy 2005 (2007/2078(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, and the committee for this excellent report. Once again, this annual report proves the added value Parliament brings to competition policy development, and I am grateful for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you rightly point out in the report, an effective competition policy plays a key role in achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals. To remain effective, competition policy needs to keep up with the evolving world around it. I am very pleased that Parliament supports the Commission’s efforts to modernise competition policy, and in particular the work we did in 2005 to pursue a more refined economic approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the report on very many issues, so I shall just mention three points where your comments really struck me.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, as you note, state aid control is essential to maintain a level playing field in the internal market. Through our ongoing reform, we are redesigning our rules to make them more simple, more transparent, more user-friendly, more coherent and more predictable. Our rules focus on the areas where limited amounts of aid can have most added value – competitiveness, the environment, training, regional cohesion, research, development and innovation. We have made good progress with the reform, but Member States must also do their share, as you say, particularly when it comes to recovering illegal state aid quickly and effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point that struck me was that 2005 was the year we launched two major sector inquiries. I agree with you about the value of these tools for a forward-looking policy. In the energy sector, you are right to be concerned that the facts show serious barriers to competition. The Commission will continue to pursue individual competition cases, working in cooperation with our colleagues in the national competition authorities. Regulation in this sector needs to be improved, with the requirement of ownership unbundling a priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, you are right that, in today’s globalised world, competition authorities need to cooperate more than ever before. Europe has a key role to play in encouraging strong competition cultures elsewhere in the world. At the same time, Europe needs to be able to respond to unfair foreign subsidies. The common commercial policy – rather than matching aid – is the proper tool to address this. Subsidy competition would undermine Europe’s cohesion, create damaging subsidy races within our internal market, and bring serious risk of WTO litigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to the debate.</p>

    <intervention id="1-176" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, this meeting between the European Parliament and the Commission is an important event in terms of competition policy, for it is the time when we evaluate one of the most important policies in the Commission’s hands, whilst defining only the general outline for the others, on the basis of which you will take this or that decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While the report that we are putting forward this year is a balanced one, it does need to be completed by an answer to the question as to what is meant by ‘fair and undistorted competition’, as the Treaty itself puts it. In fact, the situation in the business world, in which there is an increasing and underhand trend towards a way of working in which, no doubt for the sake of flexibility, trainees’ contracts are renewed month after month and, for the sake of providing the trainees with access to professional training, the difference between them and those subject to labour law is accentuated, is a real issue in terms of competition, and one that you need to consider closely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are also concerned about the conclusions that are going to be drawn from the sectoral surveys that you have been carrying out, and specifically in connection with the potential impact on the structure of this or that segment of the market. I am thinking, for example, of the situation of local banks, or of mutual banks in relation to the retail banking sector, but we would also like you to consider other sectors, which may well be more difficult to tackle. Three sectors about which we are particularly concerned are investment banks, rating agencies and auditors’ firms. We think that, if competition is to be required to be free and undistorted, one must also be bold enough to take a look at these sectors in the same way as the Commission has sometimes done with actors of equally considerable weight.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If this takes place, you can count on our support, although you must never forget that competition policy can never be an end in itself, but is in the service of a strategy of the European Union which is, today, defined not only by the Lisbon Strategy, but also by the objectives set out on 8 March 2007, those being the fight against the effects of climate change and the will to endow the European Union with the capacity for shaping its own independent energy policy.</p>

    <intervention id="1-177" speaker_id="28266" name="Sophia in 't Veld" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, I should like to pay tribute to the absent rapporteur who has, as I see it, compiled an excellent document which meets with broad support in our committee. I should also like to give Mrs Kroes credit for what she has done, because, as Mrs Berès said a moment ago with very good reason, competition policy is not an end in itself, and I think that the European Commission, precisely under the guidance of Mrs Kroes, has launched a new pragmatic approach, something which we greatly appreciate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Sometimes, people overlook the fact that competition rules are not there to bully businesses or thwart national governments. Competition rules are designed to ensure that the same rules and equal opportunities apply to everyone who operates in the internal market. These competition rules are therefore there to ensure that Europe can adopt a strong position in the world, in the face of global competition. As such, we should not compete with each other, but instead ensure that we create an internal market that functions well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I too am a staunch supporter of the sector inquiries, and where energy policy is concerned, you can count on this Parliament’s support. I should nevertheless like to make one observation. At the moment, everyone in the Member States is busy preparing for the summit that is coming up this weekend, where once again, energy policy will feature as one of the new key areas on the agenda. One of the few positive points in the whole discussion. At the same time, I have noticed that, whilst the leaders of the national governments are saying that we should have a common energy policy, they are not prepared to stop protecting their national favourites. Perhaps they should practise what they preach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to state aid, as rapporteur for state aid for public services and for innovation, I can say that we have discussed this subject before. Actually, I cannot wait to see if there is a first assessment of the impact of these exemption regulations and if, more generally, an assessment is being made of whether state aid is suitable or not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, as for the matching clause, this too has been the subject of previous discussions. It is, of course, a problem if generous levels of state aid are made available outside of the European Union. At the same time, I would prefer to reinforce Europe’s competitiveness by other means. It is highly improper, to my mind, to start giving out generous levels of state aid and subsidies, whilst we have not yet sorted out other measures, including patents, making the labour market more flexible, opening up the market for services and many other measures of this kind; mistakes like this cannot be put right with state aid.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it has always been my contention that, far from encouraging competition, the EU in its drive for the mythical ‘level playing field’ wants to stamp it out altogether. This report does little to change that perception.</p>
      <p sl="de">Paragraph 13 supports a common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another step towards a compulsory EU-wide corporation tax, which is fundamentally anti-competitive. This idea is enthusiastically supported by France and Germany, two countries with higher corporate tax rates, which must be salivating at the idea of getting everybody else’s rates up to their level.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the most stupid pieces of EU jargon that I have ever heard is ‘unfair tax competition’, which is what this clause is all about. There is nothing unfair about some Member States having more business-friendly taxation regimes than others. This encourages competition. State aid gets a bashing in this report, as you would expect, but the report makes the false assumption that all state aid is bad. In Britain, because of EU state aid restrictions, we are rapidly losing the Royal Mail postal service, to the detriment of consumers, particularly in remote areas.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, in my speech I plan to use the so-called case method, that is to say, I am going to try to draw conclusions from a single specific event that may be applicable in a general sense.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the honourable Member knows, on several occasions I have concerned myself with the issue of the takeover bids that have taken place in Spain against the Endesa electricity company. My fellow Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has referred to national champions and I believe that this case fits perfectly within that context.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know, the current Spanish Government did everything it could to prevent a German company, E.ON, from acquiring a stake in Endesa, and that conduct has already led the Commission to open up two procedures. One against the general decision empowering a particular committee to lay down specific conditions, and the other relating to those specific conditions. The Commissioner is perfectly aware of what I am talking about.</p>
      <p sl="es">Then a stake in Endesa was acquired by an Italian company, which is partly public, incidentally. I put a question to the Commissioner and received a reply today in which she says that the restrictions to the right to vote laid down by the Spanish Government are being investigated.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third chapter in this case is that the person responsible, the President of the National Energy Commission, the Spanish regulatory body, appointed by the Socialist Government, has handed in his resignation to that same Socialist Government, in protest against what he considers to be violations of his independence. That is what he explained to the Spanish Parliament. Unfortunately, we have not been able to get him to explain it in this Parliament, although I have not given up hope that there will be full and open transparency here as well. I would like to know whether the Commissioner, the Commission, is worried about this issue that affects the proper operation of the entire European market, and is an issue for the whole of Europe, and which, if you will allow me, also affects legal security, the good name and good credit in the international markets of my country, and please believe me, Commissioner, that is what is of most concern to me.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like the Commissioner to tell me whether she has carried out any investigations, whether she intends to do so, whether she intends to address this problem with the Socialist government and whether she intends to carry out reforms with a view to combating it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thank you, Madam President, I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat because my spokesman, Mr Evans, has not been here and I felt that I could make use of his time; in any event I would like to thank you.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-180" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am as impressed with the report as everyone who has already spoken. I greatly appreciate the report itself, but I appreciate even more the annual debates, particularly with the honourable Members present at this sitting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report itself makes a vital contribution to the further development of this policy. I would like to assure you that I am not only listening to you, but am taking many of your remarks – which make a lot of sense – into account. Indeed, if competition policy is to really deliver in creating growth and jobs in Europe, we need to continue working together. That means involving all the stakeholders – Parliament as well as the outside world – and taking into account the point touched upon by Sophia in 't Veld. It is not a matter of making fun of anyone but rather to set a level playing field in which everyone, both the consumer and the business world, may finally share the advantages.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to respond to a few specific issues raised in our debate this evening. Mrs Berès had some interesting ideas for new sector inquiries and I will indeed consider the subjects she touched upon: rating agencies, auditing firms and large investment banks. We have not yet made up our minds and are still discussing the matter, so I will put this on the list. It is more a matter of resources than a lack of sectors in which it might make sense to start a sector inquiry. At present the Commission has no grounds for a wide-ranging review of competition in these particular sectors, but this does not mean that we cannot take a couple of thoughts out of it. I would welcome further discussion with Parliament on these issues. Of course, the Commission is always ready to look carefully at any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour which is brought to our attention in individual situations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Berès also spoke about competition on non-traditional grounds, for example salaries. The report also mentions tax. I note that many of you are concerned by so-called tax competition among the Member States. It is correct that the Commission has powers to assess tax measures affecting competition. However, and I would like to make this quite clear, that is the case only when these measures are considered to be state aid and essentially when they are selective in nature, meaning that they do not constitute general measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now come to the point that Sophia in 't Veld touched upon. For the last 10 years the Commission has been reviewing potentially harmful tax schemes. We have challenged a series of national measures targeting, amongst others, offshore intragroup activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards salary competition, my answer is quite clear: if measures relating to salaries can be considered as state aid, the Commission will use its powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to state aid issues, in particular in reply to Sophia in 't Veld, state aid is in principle, as we are all aware, banned by the Treaty to avoid distortions of competition in our single market. State aid can indeed be a legitimate tool to deliver outcomes which are in the general interest, for example regional cohesion, research and development, as well as innovation and high-quality public services which markets themselves will not deliver. That is why our approach is to design a new set of state aid rules, which we did with the review. It uses a more economic approach to assess where market failures exist and to target appropriate aid measures on them. That is a balanced and a realistic view. It reflects the need to help Member States get the best out of taxpayers’ money – state aid is, at the end of the day, taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission publishes its state aid scoreboards twice a year. As you are aware, this presents data and analyses of Member States’ expenditure on state aid measures. It includes a focus on Member States’ progress towards the Lisbon goals of less and better aid. The next edition will pay close attention to the question of recovery. In addition, a series of indicators and statistical tables on our Europa website gives scope for further discussion. But Sophia in 't Veld is right: we need to do more to evaluate the effects of state aid, whether it makes sense and how. That is how the new more economic approach could help us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can be brief in response to Mr García-Margallo y Marfil: we have discussed this before and we know exactly what the dossier is about. We have taken the Member State concerned to Court for not respecting our two Article 21 decisions under the Merger Regulation. My colleague, Charlie McCreevy, is taking parallel action under the internal market rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am always open to your suggestions for further improving the way in which competition policy makes markets function better. I badly need your ideas and your creativity. We are doing our utmost to complete this process, and I am grateful for your continued support and valuable contribution. We are not there yet but are on the right track.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the crucial area of energy, we support the Commission’s action on ownership unbundling.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We reiterate the call on the Commission to clarify at Community level the public service obligations to which operators of services of general economic interest should be bound, with regard to strategic security and universal coverage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also believe it is important to ensure that the EU’s external dimension is consistent with competition policy when it comes to negotiating bilateral trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In spite of the Commission’s efforts at harmonising practices and guaranteeing transparency, it is a fact that there is competition in terms of incentives between EU regions and Member States, which, along with the absence of tax harmonisation, foments the artificial relocation of companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These and other challenges illustrate the need to strengthen the EU’s ability to deliver effective competition rules and to improve flexibility of response to new challenges. Hence the importance of continuing to give the European Competition Authority the resources it needs.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0157/2007) by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur (COM(2006)0684 – C6-0428/2006 – 2006/0236(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have had the opportunity in the past to discuss this proposal in committees and intergroups. I am sure you will understand that I am very happy to be having this debate with you tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the work of all Members of the European Parliament, especially that of the rapporteur, who has done a very good job. I would also like to thank the draftswoman and draftsman of the other committees, Mrs Lucas and Mr Stevenson.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was a real challenge for me when I was first confronted with this issue after taking up my post. For me, the most frustrating part was that we had an issue which was very close to the heart of European citizens and which had the support of the Council and, clearly, of the European Parliament but also of the Commission, yet we still had problems in proceeding with this proposal. The problems were, of course, legal and not the result of a lack of political will.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy that we have now reached a point where, using some imaginative and constructive approaches, we have managed to find solutions, and that we are now able to have a first reading agreement, which is very important to me. We are all familiar with the issue and know that the disturbing evidence of barbaric treatment of cats and dogs, which are bred and killed mainly for their fur, especially in Asia, has provoked a strong call for the Commission to take action.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said, we had to find ways not only to express tangibly the political will of all the institutions involved and the citizens, but also to do so in a legally sound way that would ensure that this will could face and withstand any challenges arising in the future. I am very happy that, through the proposal and, in particular, the various trialogues, we have managed to reach a compromise. This compromise is legally sound and will ensure that the ban will be effective in practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">For us, it is important to have results, not just to issue a political statement or express political will, which would eventually become ineffective. It would be correct politically, but it would not produce the results that we want: the protection of cats and dogs and, even more importantly, of European consumers who do not want to be offered the fur of cats and dogs, which they consider their pets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to mention two of my colleagues by name, Mr Mandelson and Mr McCreevy. Both were very supportive of our work in this area. As you know, the legal basis we have been using relates to the internal market and trade. This was necessary, because, unfortunately, there is no legal basis in the Treaty that would allow the EU to adopt a legislative initiative to ban a particular trade based on animal welfare or ethical concerns. Furthermore, there is no legal basis for animal protection as such in the Treaty, so we had to use these two legal bases, and my colleagues have been very supportive of this work.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also had another legal challenge: the issue of proportionality. For reasons of proportionality it was necessary to consider including a provision that would allow for possible derogations to the ban. None of us was happy with this idea and, as I said, the only reason was to make this proposal more legally sound. I believe that we have managed to reach a proper compromise. As you know, this approach was also clearly supported by the legal services of all three institutions, the Commission, Parliament and the Council. But the compromise we have today is the right one. It contains the possibility – and I emphasise the word ‘possibility’ – to derogate exceptionally from the trade ban for taxidermy or educational purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have used the legal bases described and we know that this approach will benefit not only European consumers but also animal welfare, especially since we cannot introduce our animal welfare rules outside the European Union. We cannot promote them internationally, but, by closing the market to the unscrupulous people who practise this trade, we are not only sending a clear message but also helping to stop this practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked very hard to get the legislative proposal to the present stage and to reach an acceptable compromise. I very much hope that the vote tomorrow will reflect this positive and constructive attitude, so we can put this legislation in place as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow when we vote on this report, we shall have the opportunity to make great efforts to put a stop to the dreadful cruelty sometimes suffered by dogs and cats – animals of which we often make pets.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As the rapporteur responsible for this matter, I am both pleased and satisfied with the report on which we – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have now agreed. I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation. I also wish to thank the Chairwoman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, together with my fellow Members. I wish to thank Mr Stevenson who, I know, has worked for many years in order to achieve progress on this matter. Everyone has shown a lot of commitment and a desire to obtain an outcome that is good for dogs and cats.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The work has been extremely interesting, particularly in view of the interest shown by the public in this issue. I am completely convinced that the opinions widely held among the public and among animal rights organisations have contributed very significantly to our reaching this agreement. I want to say a big thank you to all those committed people who have added names to petitions and participated in a variety of campaigns. They have shown that we no longer accept such cruelty to animals. Thank you, everyone. Your protests have borne fruit.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many of us have seen documentaries, films and pictures showing dogs and cats having their fur removed even when they were still alive. It is enough to see just one picture or documentary showing such cruelty to animals to realise that everything must be done to put a stop to it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Humane Society estimates that more than two million cats and dogs are kept prisoner under disgusting conditions before being killed for the sake of their fur. The fur and skins are then sold under false designations such as ‘China wolf’ or ‘Asian wolf’ and used, for example, for cuddly toys for children, decorative objects, clothes and handbags.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must now put a stop to this trade, above all because of the extreme cruelty involved in fur production. That reason is enough, but nor - I might add - is there any need for cat or dog fur in any product at all, because synthetic materials can be substituted for it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">False descriptions extensively deceive consumers. Unsuspecting consumers can buy toys for their children in good faith and without having the slightest idea that a cat may have been skinned alive in order to be used for that very toy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It has been maintained in the debate that we need the skins in question in order, for example, to relieve joint pain, in other words for medical reasons. My answer to that is that, in 2007, no patient is prescribed cat skin to combat rheumatic pain when he or she visits the doctor. We have progressed beyond that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I, as rapporteur, together with everyone committed to this cause, had great hopes, then, when the Commission’s proposal was accepted. We believed that we needed a total ban, but the Commission’s original proposal made certain exemptions possible, for example when the label stated that the fur came from cats or dogs that had not been bred or slaughtered for manufacturing purposes or when the skins concerned were personal belongings or household objects.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My view throughout has been that the regulation would be an empty gesture if scope were allowed for such exemptions, as the situation would be quite impossible to monitor and the exemptions would pave the way for continued trade and for the dreadful practices described. It was not a regulation of that kind that people were requesting or demanding of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am therefore now pleased to be able to say that we have a proposal for a total ban following discussions with the Commission and the Council. I hope that Parliament will support the proposal tomorrow by voting in favour of the amendments to which the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has unanimously agreed. We also have proposals concerning the way in which the rules would be applied in the Member States, and we propose that the Member States should also have to report to the Commission on the way in which compliance with the rules is monitored.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am convinced that the public will be watching us carefully when we vote tomorrow, as there is a real demand for measures to be taken on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to really warmly welcome Mrs Svensson’s report and to congratulate her on her excellent work. She has been a brilliant rapporteur and we have got a very positive result. It is very clear that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I must say that, in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission, we have had to wait quite a long time. I remember writing to Commissioner Byrne back in 2002 calling for a ban on cat and dog fur. We were told simply that it was a very complex issue and the Commission was reflecting.</p>
      <p sl="en">What worries me about that is that in a sense this slowness is being repeated on another issue that I want to turn your minds to, which is the issue of banning imports of seal products. Again, Parliament is being told that it is a complex issue. Exactly the same language is being used again now, when it comes to seal products, as was used back in 2002 about cat and dog fur.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade, I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal, not suggesting that we try to include seals – that would be too much – but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products. This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner said earlier that there was no lack of political will when it came to dealing with the cat and dog issue, what was lacking was an imaginative legal base. I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinarily imaginative and to recognise that Europe’s citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products. We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my very warm thanks to Mrs Svensson for a brilliant piece of work and a brilliant report. I also wish to thank Mrs McCarthy for her dedication and commitment to steering this very important report through Parliament. However, most of all, I am grateful for the great courage of Commissioner Kyprianou, because, as Mrs Lucas has just said, the previous Commissioner told us that it was impossible and there would never be a legal basis. I remember Commissioner Kyprianou saying to me, ‘As a lawyer, if I went round telling clients that things were impossible, I would never make a living!’. He has fulfilled his pledge.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is music to my ears to hear this debate this evening, because it has taken eight years to get this far, with the help of Humane Society International. Betsy Dribben, who used to work for Humane Society International, has flown over from Washington and is in the public gallery tonight, and many thanks are due to her for her dogged campaigning.</p>
      <p sl="en">Humane Society International estimates that, every year, about two million cats and dogs are killed in China alone to supply the fashion market in Europe with items like this little toy, which the rapporteur mentioned – little cats, which mums and dads buy for their kids because they are cat and dog lovers, not realising that they have been made out of real cat and dog skin from animals that have been brutally killed. The trade buys these cat skins to make collars for trim for parka hoods and ski boot and ski glove linings and all sorts of fashion items.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has been a fraud perpetrated on the public. The public are never told that they are buying items made of real cat and dog fur. Sometimes it is even dyed to look like fake fur and given false labels to fool the public. I am glad that, at long last, there will very soon be a regulation on the statute books in all 27 Member States banning this evil trade. I thank the Commissioner and everyone else who has been involved in achieving that.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, banning the trade in cat and dog fur in the EU is important for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The first is the completely unacceptable so-called cat industry in Asia supplying Europe with a reported 2 million cats a year. It is outrageous that animals are skinned alive for their fur. This is the cheapest and most appalling method. I am aware that an EU regulation cannot bring about a change of behaviour among industrial breeders in third countries, but it can substantially reduce the volume of animals traded.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The second reason is that European consumers do not know that they are buying these products. If they knew they would not buy them. Cats and dogs are thought of as domestic pets in Europe. Most Europeans have no idea that cat and dog fur contributes not only to the more expensive furs of other animals but also to artificial fur. These products are not properly labelled. This is not an ethical problem, as opponents of this regulation would have it; rather, it is a matter of misleading the consumer, either intentionally or otherwise. The Union has a major obligation to prevent this. It is of course necessary for customs services in the Member States to employ effective means of determining, definitively and at reasonable expense, whether imported goods contain cat or dog fur.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The main reason, however, for adopting this regulation is the fragmentation of the market. Almost half the Member States have laws regulating or banning the trade in cat and dog fur whereas the rest do not. These regulations, with their lack of harmony, are exploited by traders on the European market, who transport goods made of cat and dog fur to the European countries where these goods are not yet banned. This regulation will substantially improve the enforcement of this law. Parliament has amended the Commission’s text so that the only exception would be the use of fur for non-commercial purposes. This is because we do not want to bring about a nonsensical criminalisation of ordinary citizens.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I call on all of you who believe that the Union has no power to intervene in these matters to see that this is simply not the case. Article 95 authorises the EU to take action in such matters because we have a common interest in the functioning of a European market with legitimate commodities. I am grateful to the Commission and applaud the rapporteurs for their work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in fact Mr Stevenson is right: eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead, the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, asked you as a Commission to take action. On 30 December last year, I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban. We have acted, but I believe that it is the citizens, in their determination, and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you, Commissioner, to give us the legal power to ban it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur. Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law. Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long. But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes, toys and household products made from cat and dog fur. I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee’s negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door.</p>
      <p sl="en">So can I just be very clear: we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations, exceptional derogations. That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States. We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working. We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban. There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders. In short, a ban must mean a ban in principle and in practice – not a restriction enabling continuation of the trade by the back door.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs Svensson for her commitment and the work she has done. We, as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, support this compromise. It has surprised me enormously why it has taken so long before we managed to strike this compromise with the Council and Commission, because we in this House had to do a huge amount of work to reach this compromise. I am pleased with the outcome, particularly the fact that we are assuming an exemption position that is compatible with that of the United States and Australia. This is how we, as the western civilised world, can stand united against the nasty way certain countries deal with their pets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to endorse what Mrs Lucas said. When will there be a ban on seal fur? I should like to take this one step further still, as I believe that there are many more things the civilised world should take to heart where animals are concerned. I do not want to enter into detail about it at the moment, but I think there is much to say on this subject, and the Commissioner may already have ideas on this for future proposals.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Even though this ban may be at the expense of a number of Dutch expressions, such as de hond in de pot vinden [find your dinner in the dog] or de kat in de zak kopen [buy a cat in a sack], this does mean that we are keen to protect the animals that are dear to us, and it is unacceptable for our children to be faced with parts of their pets incorporated in their toys.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I should like to stress that the ALDE Group supports the compromise proposal as a whole; we do not have any problems with it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to mention the other side of the coin, though. In China, dogs are served up for dinner on a regular basis. To the Chinese, their fur is a residual product with economic value; this ban will have the effect that the economic value of the fur will take a significant nosedive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Taking this one step further, this means that if pork and beef are part of our staple diet, it should no longer be possible to use their skins/hides either. We may have to give this matter some more thought, to see what we can do about this in future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I fully support the ban on imports of cat and dog fur. At the moment, it is the least that we can do to combat cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Dogs and cats have a particularly close bond to humans. They serve us and are devoted to us. Cruelty to these animals is particularly hurtful. We know that killing dogs and cats for fur is cruel and European Union Member States should not be indifferent to this practice. We cannot influence how animals are treated in other cultures, but we can at least say ‘no’ to goods bought at the price of unimaginable suffering caused to animals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should say ‘no’ to any kind of cruelty, irrespective of the victim involved. Sensitivity is universal. A sensitive person would never condone the suffering of another being, whether it is another human or an animal. The Union will have a purpose when it becomes a community of people who are sensitive to all pain, to all suffering.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's position.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen. I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur. It is thanks to Mrs Svensson’s persistence that Parliament will be able to adopt, as early as tomorrow, at first reading, a Regulation banning the trade in and processing of dog and cat fur. In the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, Mrs Svensson successfully fought for a complete ban on the trade in and processing of this fur and thus said a clear ‘no’ to the derogations originally proposed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must now ensure that the Member States implement this Regulation properly. This represents a great success for animal protection. This Regulation will eliminate once and for all the situation in which millions of cats and dogs have been kept and killed, sometimes in atrocious conditions, so that their fur can be processed and exported to Europe. This is also a triumph for democracy in Europe, as numerous citizens have called for this ban in the form of signature campaigns and petitions. This Regulation is also in the interests of consumers, as many citizens were completely unaware when purchasing products such as soft toys, clothing or keyrings that these contained dog or cat fur. All too often, traders have circumvented the existing voluntary code of conduct and placed dog or cat fur on the market mislabelled or with no labelling.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is high time Europe took this important step for international animal protection, and thus followed the example of other countries, such as the USA and Australia, who introduced a similar ban years ago. Now, by means of tighter customs controls, new methods of analysis and criminal measures, we must ensure that the provisions adopted today are enforced effectively throughout Europe and all legal loopholes eliminated.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It was in fact high time that the Member States were reminded that dogs and cats are companion animals and that the trade in their furs and in products derived from them must not be accepted or even tolerated. Imposing, by law, such a ban in Europe, and making provision for effective and deterrent sanctions in the event of its being infringed, is the very least one can do today. There is no end to the fraudulent and deceitful practices that one finds going on, particularly in Asia, with the labels of most clothes made there – be they coats, hats, handbags, gloves, and shoes, not to mention toys, decorations and small leather goods – bearing the deceptive description of ‘leather’ or ‘real fur’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If a stop is to be put to this ignoble trade, each and every European citizen must adopt a responsible and ethical attitude by demanding, specifically, the labelling of all leather, skin and fur goods and of all food and pharmaceutical products whose origins might be a matter of doubt. Let us unite in refusing to encourage those countries in which human rights and dignity are disregarded and which, moreover, have no sense of having a duty of care for animals.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() I would like to begin by observing that the fur industry has always been important in Slovakia, but it did not really start to expand until after 1990. Following Slovakia’s EU accession, Slovak furriers have been exclusively importing fur materials from buyers in EU Member States. Being direct importers, these buyers can ensure the full legality and legitimacy of the imports, including the relevant certificates.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I understand the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, and share her opinion that the large number of petitions and concerns expressed by consumers and citizens throughout the EU means that the Commission cannot remain inactive over the matter of banning the trade in cat and dog fur. It is indeed necessary to clarify existing legal requirements in all Member States. We must respond to the ethical concerns expressed by citizens over the possible presence of cat and dog fur in the Community, particularly in view of the indications that these animals may be being raised and killed in an inhumane manner.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Consumers are concerned that cat and dog fur cannot be readily distinguished from other furs or synthetic materials imitating fur, and this may give rise to unfair and fraudulent practices involving fur products, including fraudulent or misleading designations. There is no tradition in the Community of breeding cats and dogs for the purpose of manufacturing fur, and in fact the vast majority of products from cat and dog fur present in the Community come from third countries. In order to protect the internal market, customs supervision over the movement of goods from third countries to the European Union should be tightened.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Illegal imports could be addressed by stricter penalties against perpetrators, including heavy fines or the withdrawal of licences. I firmly believe that it is necessary to adopt European legislation that would unify market rules in the EU Member States At the same time, however, EU initiatives must not become a brake and cause the fur industry problems by disrupting legitimate fur trading. We must avoid putting up obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and ensure the free movement of legally traded fur and fur products in general.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, like my fellow Members, I wish to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for an outstanding piece of work and for her excellent cooperation on this matter. The regulation we are debating today is a good, important and very necessary piece of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is good legislation because it enables us to send a clear signal to the many EU citizens who have asked us to do something to prevent dogs and cats from being used for fur production. In this way, we are showing them that we are in actual fact listening to their concerns and making an active attempt to put a stop to cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is also an important piece of legislation because it has emerged that we cannot stop the sale of dog and cat fur solely by means of bans in the individual Member States. During the committee reading of the regulation, Mr Stevenson of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection showed us many dog and cat skins bought in Europe, including a skin made from four golden retrievers and bought in my own home city of Copenhagen. In Denmark we already have a ban, but it is clearly not good enough. We therefore need an effective ban at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="da">The proposed legislation is also necessary because huge numbers of dogs and cats lead wretched lives that end in the most terrible suffering imaginable, and all because they have to provide fur for clothes and toys. By devising a common EU ban, we reduce the market for the sale of dog and cat fur and, at the same time, send a powerful signal concerning the repugnance we feel towards cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am therefore delighted that we have managed to devise as strict and sound a ban as this. The exemptions provided for will be so rare that they will each have to be justified and approved individually. We are as close to a total ban as is legally possible at the present time, and that is to be welcomed. However, the legislative text is not enough in itself. It is crucial that we continue to work on developing methods to enable us more effectively to identify where fur originates and to stop the traffic in illegal fur, which shady and unscrupulous characters will otherwise not hesitate to sell.</p>

      <p sl="sl">None of the assertions usually made as a justification for cruelty to animals can be made in the case of the trade in dog and cat fur. They are not being killed for clothing or food, and not even for the purposes of hunting.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The incentive for this slaughter has been provided by the global market; in other words the demand of certain industries for raw materials that are cheaper than synthetic ones, since people living in extreme poverty on other continents receive very little for the sale of such items.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European market is now generating world supply through its demand. And it is time now for us to put an end to this, both for ethical reasons and also so that we can put an end to the deception of consumers, who do not realise that they are buying garments or toys made from dog or cat fur. It would be better if there were no exceptions to the ban on imports. Yet if we remain focused on the main goal, then a compromise also makes sense.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Effective implementation of the regulation will be extremely important. Here we expect great things from the Commission and especially from Mr. Kyprianou, whom I thank, as I do the rapporteur Mrs Svensson, for their efforts.</p>

Most cats and dogs growing up in Europe can count on being stroked, fed, exercised and well cared for. However, those people who buy cuddly toys or fashionable handbags made of cat or dog fur contribute to a trade that causes animals to be tortured, beaten and flayed alive.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This legislative proposal is unusual. Firstly, the EU has finally listened to the voice of the people, who wish to ban this repulsive trade. Secondly, the internal market was considered to operate best if we banned the trade. For once, animal protection has taken precedence over the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I wish to emphasise the importance of not allowing the exemptions to undermine the ban. Finally, we have a precedent that points the way to trade based on values other than market fundamentalism. I hope and demand that, once we have brought this matter to a conclusion, the next topic will be a ban on the import of seal skins.

On each occasion, whether we were talking about seals, dogs, cats or foxes, I am sorry to have to say that the Commission played for time and allowed the trade to continue to the greater glory of the Market Almighty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us never forget that, in March 1996, despite proof that mad cow disease was capable of being transmitted to humans, the Commission threatened four German Länder with sanctions for their refusal to allow the importation of suspect cattle. The lesson one can learn from all that is that the logic of the market demands that everything be capable of being bought or sold or used as a means to making a profit, whether it be dogs, cats, kidneys, eyes, women, children, slaves, or workers. That is why the economy must be subject to political constraints, in order that those great values that are beyond price may be re-established.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, over one million Europeans have lobbied in favour of banning the import of cat and dog fur into the EU. The Commission listened to the European Parliament and reacted by taking legislative action to ban the import of cat and dog fur. I welcome this and hope that we will see an end to the barbaric trade which accounts for the slaughter of over two million cats and dogs each year.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we do not just want warm words. Some constituents have raised concerns that loopholes in the Commission’s proposal may allow imports via the back door. I recently tabled a written question asking the Commission about derogations that might allow the trade to continue. The reply that I received gave information on two derogations, one relating to fur that was part of personal or household effects being brought into the EU, and the other relating to fur or products containing fur that have not been bred or killed for fur production.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the fact that several EU countries – France, Italy, Denmark, Greece and Belgium – moved unilaterally to ban the trade. However, there are differences in the approaches of other Member States, ranging from bans on rearing and slaughter to labelling requirements. These differences can cause problems for consumers, retailers and traders alike. That is why, as we all know, an EU-wide ban is so important if we want an end to this vile trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already heard that 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their fur and that it takes at least 10 dogs and up to 24 cats to make a single coat. These animals live in horrific conditions and many are skinned alive. Since the US brought in a ban, more cat and dog fur is coming into the EU. The problem is that many customers do not know what they are buying, as cat and dog fur is quite often labelled as fake fur. It is also included in a variety of products other than clothing, such as some homeopathic medicines, children’s toys and accessories.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, before making a few points, I should first like to briefly mention two practical issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I appreciate the need for monitoring and reporting, and that is why we are in agreement with Parliament on this. Effective and analytical methods are in place, which will be very helpful in implementing this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on labelling, it was always debatable whether labelling would be enough. We decided – and I think Parliament was in agreement – that labelling was not enough and therefore we proposed legislation. However, on the general issue of labelling, we are following very closely voluntary initiatives, programmes and schemes that already exist to cover other fur products and ensure that consumers are properly informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of seals, I have to say at the outset that it is not my responsibility. My colleague, Mr Dimas, has already made a statement to Parliament on this issue. I was expecting this question, so I can tell you that EFSA has already been asked by the European Commission to provide a full objective assessment on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals, which was what Commissioner Dimas promised you.</p>
      <p sl="en">We expect to have this report in November, and based on that the Commission will assess in the shortest possible time the options to respond to this issue. I am sure my colleague will be very happy to discuss this issue with you once he has received the EFSA report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to make two or three points. I understand the frustration of many of you who were here before I was. You have talked about ‘a long time’. I have been in office for only two and a half years and I have already produced a proposal. I do not know what happened in the past, but I think we would all appreciate that this Commission would not only make a commitment but also deliver this proposal within a reasonable time. I would just like to mention that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I appreciate that the support of the European citizens has made a great impact; it was a great issue for us and it helped me convince those who needed convincing. However, you have all had a chance to talk with me privately on this issue and you know that I personally did not need to be persuaded or convinced about this. As soon as I was informed about this practice, I immediately gave instructions for my departments to start working on it. Therefore, credit me with the fact that I did not need any convincing as soon as I saw the films and knew what the practice was.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, let me mention the derogations. I know your views. From the very beginning I said that I was not happy with them either. However, you must realise that we started with a completely negative approach and then we managed to present a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the Commission wanted to allow loopholes, we would never have brought the proposal in the first place. We are just trying to find the best possible way to make it legally sound to be able to withstand any challenges before the court. That was our approach. We proposed several derogations; these were not agreed upon. We have found a very positive outcome with a compromise. Trust me, we never intended to allow any loopholes. What we were trying to do, based on legal advice, was to make this as effective and as solid as possible. The principle was upheld by the other two legal services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I am very happy that we are having this debate and that we are competing with each other as regards who wants more – what more could one ask? This is the right approach and your support gave me enough strength to convince whoever needed convincing. Therefore, I am looking forward to working with you on many other issues that touch upon animal welfare.</p>

      <p sl="fi">First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Eva-Britt Svensson, for having done a splendid job, and for having added certain elements to the Commission initiative, in particular that violation of the ban will result in prosecution and that derogations to the ban are unacceptable. She has been able to see through the entire process diplomatically, so that now we only need to adopt the long-awaited ban in plenary without further ado.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The whole process has also been an exemplary indication of how decisions and legislation at EU level can be influenced by citizen action. There would hardly have been an initiative for legislation on the matter but for the petitions by citizens and active lobbying. I do hope that this example will encourage the citizens of the Union to take a more active part in EU decision-making.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the Union’s proposal on a complete ban on the trade in cat and dog fur because I believe that it is unacceptable that around two million dogs and cats are butchered every year for this purpose. 12-15 dogs need to be killed to produce one dog fur coat and 24 cats for one cat fur coat. The vast majority of European consumers condemn the barbaric slaughter of our favourite domestic animals and do not wish to buy these products. This is why importers often give cat fur products various invented names to mislead the well-meaning customer. We need to have a comprehensive EU ban and put an end to this barbaric practice permanently. As so often happens, company self-regulation has proved to be ineffective in this case too. Retailers do not even label which animal the furs originate from. At the moment, fifteen Member States ban the trade in dog and cat fur, but there has been no general ban in the other countries until now. A comprehensive ban is an important step towards a more humane, animal-friendly society in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Commission, on the Multiple Sclerosis Code of Best Practice (O-0028/2007 – B6-0124/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-206" speaker_id="24087" name="Marcin Libicki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Parliament has dealt with health issues on a number of occasions. However, the view is often expressed that Parliament should focus on general health issues, such as medical treatment, insurance and appropriate care for those both ill and healthy. People sometimes say that it should not concern itself with specific diseases. However, I think that the disease being discussed today, namely multiple sclerosis, is a problem on such a dramatic scale that Parliament’s involvement is justified. Neither is it the first time that the European Parliament is taking action in this field.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A few weeks ago, on 29 May of this year, a conference was organised in Brussels by the European MS Platform. This conference was held under the auspices of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert Pöttering, for which we thank him, and was organised by Mrs Uma Aaltonen. I would like to remind you that Mrs Uma Aaltonen was once one of our colleagues. She was a Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman. Mrs Uma Aaltonen suffers from multiple sclerosis herself. She is a writer, a journalist and a teacher, and particularly supports this cause.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind you that the Committee on Petitions dealt with the issue of multiple sclerosis in petition 842/2001. As a result of this petition, the Committee on Petitions produced a report which was discussed in Parliament during the December plenary session in 2003. Thanks to our cooperation with multiple sclerosis associations in all the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, a code of best practice was drawn up on the basis of this report and the resolution which accompanied it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The matter is really extremely important as the tragic situation facing multiple sclerosis sufferers is not reflected in statistics. As the participants at this conference pointed out, and as we heard during our previous debate on the subject, mortality statistics often state as the cause of death the failure of the pulmonary or the cardiovascular system, but do not mention that the primary cause of the pulmonary failure was simply muscular paralysis and that the patient suffocated, or that the cause of the cardiovascular failure was multiple sclerosis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, the statistics often do not provide us with the relevant information about how many people are seriously ill, how many suffer and how many die as a result of this illness. Multiple sclerosis sufferers are ill for many years. In the end, the cause of their death, statistically speaking, it pains me to say, is an entirely different disease. The Committee on Petitions met multiple sclerosis sufferers, we participated in these conferences and, during our mission to Berlin, we met the Minister of State of the German Government, Günter Gloser, with whom we discussed the matter, as the petitions committee of the German parliament is also dealing with the issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, I would like to put a question to the Commission and to ask it to state the means, methods and efforts that it has undertaken to implement the European Parliament’s resolution and the code of good practice that was drawn up on the basis of the resolution. I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could answer this question.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-207" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that we acknowledge, understand and appreciate the seriousness of this disease. Not only is it a serious disease, but it also affects young men and women in Europe and all over the world in the most productive period of their lives; people who have usually already formed their own families, have young children, have all their life ahead of them and then have to go through these difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, we appreciate the importance not only of the European Parliament’s resolution but also of the code of best practice, which was drafted by the Platform.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have already said, the Commission also participated in the first European conference on multiple sclerosis last month, and that conference was organised in the context of our public health programme. It was a project funded by the programme ‘Multiple Sclerosis – the Information Dividend’ and led by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, many of the aspects relating to this disease have to be dealt with by the Member States, so it is a gradual process that will take some time, but the Commission is there to help, support and encourage.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the conference, many essential points were presented concerning the follow-up to Parliament’s resolution of 2003, especially regarding the discriminatory treatment afforded to people with multiple sclerosis. The Commission is taking action in the main fields covered by the proposal regarding a code of good practice on the right of people affected by multiple sclerosis to quality of life. Some actions target multiple sclerosis directly; others are of a more general or, let us say, horizontal or generic nature but, again, they are of benefit to the issue of multiple sclerosis as well, for example, the issue of equal rights and access to treatment and therapies for multiple sclerosis. The Commission, within its more general framework of safe, high-quality and efficient health services, is reinforcing cooperation between Member States. It is helping create reference networks for diseases, exchange of best practice and centres of reference, and the objective of these will be to ensure equal rights to patients and equal level of treatment all over the European Union. So, once these networks are established, they can cover multiple sclerosis as well, especially with centres of reference and exchange of best practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">On research, on the other hand, we have a more directly targeted agenda and initiatives. The seventh Framework Programme includes collaborative activities on research into brain-related diseases, human development and ageing, with particular emphasis on how to turn basic discoveries into clinical applications. One first call proposal for this topic was neuro-glia interaction in health and disease, which is of direct interest to the multiple sclerosis research community. Also, under the preceding programmes (the fifth and the sixth), the Commission funded 18 projects on multiple sclerosis, the largest of which, in the sixth programme, totalled EUR 11.4 million and related to neuro-protective strategies for multiple sclerosis.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of employment and discrimination, which is important for us, Directive 2000/78/EC already prohibits discrimination based on disability in employment, occupation and vocational training, and requires employers to put in place reasonable accommodation tailored to the individual case to enable a person with a disability to work or undertake training.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to encouraging actions and promoting strategies for the adaptation, and reintegration into working life, of affected persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of participation and empowerment, the project I mentioned earlier, ‘Mutliple Sclerosis – the Information Dividend’, will facilitate consensus on agreed European quality standards on information about multiple sclerosis, which has to be accessible, delivered in a timely manner by appropriately skilled and experienced professionals and provided in an equitable and efficient way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission intends to discuss with Member States a proposal for a large European consensus conference on neuro-degenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, to be held in 2009 or 2010, and the Commission will be able (on the basis of conclusions endorsed both by public and private stakeholders at that conference) to propose a communication or other relevant policy initiative, including specific actions in all the fields of disease prevention, research and management of this group of diseases. We will, of course, keep Parliament informed of all the next steps.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed three and a half years ago that Parliament, in a resolution to both the Council and the Commission, asked for important measures to support European citizens suffering from MS. As the Commissioner already pointed out, much progress has indeed been made. Whilst on behalf of Parliament, I expressed our support at this conference on 29 May, I would still like to put three specific questions to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The code of good practice should indeed be circulated and adopted in all Member States as quickly as possible. Is the Commission prepared to make information on MS available in a similar form on the EU’s health portal for all patients?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second question is about the MS concept project that was launched recently within the framework of the health programme and funded by the Commission. This project must lead to an MS register that can be used by everybody. Will the Commission be supporting this financially?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I should like to ask you whether the Commission will be taking any further initiatives in terms of framework legislation, in which priority is given to safeguarding MS patients’ jobs?</p>

    <intervention id="1-209" speaker_id="1289" name="Proinsias De Rossa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Libicki for taking the initiative of bringing this matter before the House tonight. I welcome also my own opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis, and indeed the prevention of their marginalisation from society, there is a huge disparity in the way in which people affected by multiple sclerosis are treated across the European Union. Consequently, many thousands of people and their families suffer unnecessarily a poor quality of life. Access to essential drugs, therapies and services, are too often not driven by need, but by where a person happens to reside and whether their government invests sufficiently in those needs. It is a sad fact that it is not always the case of Member States not having the resources to provide such care and services. My own country, Ireland, is a prime example. We have had 10 years of enormous economic growth and wealth, and yet we still have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients among the EU’s wealthy nations. We need more research to advance our understanding of the illness and how best to treat it. Regrettably, in this House we constantly face opposition to such research, particularly embryo stem cell research, which offers the best hope for making advances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it is not appropriate to allow a situation to continue in which citizens of the European Union are treated unequally. While I acknowledge that it is primarily a responsibility of the Member States to deliver health care, it is also a responsibility of the European Commission to ensure that equality is applied across the board. I would like to see them sponsoring a ‘race to the top’ in terms of services for people with disabilities generally, but certainly people with multiple sclerosis. I believe publication of the progress being made by Member States signing up to this code of conduct would help drive that race to the top.</p>

    <intervention id="1-210" speaker_id="4541" name="Elizabeth Lynne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, there are approximately 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis within the EU. Louise McVay’s petition brought our attention to MS in 2003 and it is only right that, three and a half years on, the Commission reports on the progress it has made in ensuring that the code of best practice, in particular, is implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">The 2003 resolution called for equal access to health care for people with MS, but some drugs, like beta interferon, are still not uniformly available. In the UK we have a postcode lottery for this drug, with availability depending on where someone lives. In Poland only 1% of people with MS are treated with disease-modifying drugs, compared to 50% in Sweden.</p>
      <p sl="de">People with MS should be cared for in the best way possible, as called for by the code of best practice. It also calls for people with MS to be able to retain their jobs and obtain sufficient help and support to remain in mainstream society. That is why, as the Commissioner said, it is so important for the Employment Directive 2000 to be implemented equally across the EU. This year is the Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Let us hope that it is also the year that we get a firm timetable for specific directives to outlaw discrimination in access to goods and services as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This debate on measures to assist EU citizens with multiple sclerosis is of the highest importance. It is important to point out that measures have been taken on the basis of the December 2003 resolution aimed at giving greater visibility to the disease and at preventing discrimination against the 400 000-plus sufferers in the Community alone.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is vital that the Commission attach major importance to research aimed at speeding up the development of more effective treatment of all forms of multiple sclerosis and that it take into account the code of best practice on this matter drawn up by multiple sclerosis societies in the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what he intends to do to ensure equal opportunities for multiple sclerosis sufferers and to raise awareness among the Member States so that they pay greater attention to the problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU. Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my own country of Ireland, we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients: 17, where we should have a minimum of 39, a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to correct Mr De Rossa: stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have, to date, produced no treatments, whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments, and it is to be hoped that, some day, there will be a treatment for MS.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to point out that, in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water, the burden of disease in the EU is increasing. Why? Because instances of MS and every other autoimmune condition, of which there are many, are on the increase. There is a widespread breakdown in the functioning of the human immune system. This is a crisis that we should not ignore. It is time to take an honest look at the unnatural and constant way in which modern life bombards the human immune system from its earliest stages, resulting in problems like poor immune development and immune collapse …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in 2003, the European Parliament adopted, by a decisive majority, a resolution on the unequal treatment of multiple sclerosis sufferers in the European Union. At the time, the blatant discrimination affecting many multiple sclerosis sufferers in Europe resulted in Parliament asking the Commission to draw up a code of best practice to which all Member States should adhere.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Four years have passed and the problem of MS has returned with double the impact as a result of the appalling situation facing sufferers in the new Member States. In terms of the number of MS sufferers living there, Poland ranks third in Europe. However, in contrast to the first and second place countries where 30% of sufferers have access to standard treatment only 2% of MS suffers in Poland have access to standard care. The situation is similar in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary. If we also consider the fact that MS is an illness that affects young people and is the second most frequent cause of disability in Europe, the conclusions are obvious. I would therefore like to ask you to compare Parliament's common position on MS with the results of the Commission’s work, particularly taking into account the situation faced by MS sufferers in the twelve new Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, multiple sclerosis should – and must – be recognised through better support for sufferers and by finding practical solutions. This can be achieved through equitable access for citizens to health services and through the equitable provision of all effective means.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are broad differences between the Member States in the quality of care. The adoption of the Code of Best Practice proposed by the European Parliament is an expression of our political will to determine uniform methods of care and rehabilitation activities. This will support the right to an independent life, which depends on the provision of prompt and suitable health and social care for dignity and independence.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, the aim is to have more, better coordinated research. The McBay case illustrated how even one citizen fighting alone is enough to turn the attention of the decision-makers to cases which may be unheard of sometimes or overlooked.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, almost everybody knows that true equality in the 27 Member States is but an elusive dream. This is particularly so in the field of health care, and it is most obvious when dealing with complex neurodegenerative disorders such as MS, which require highly specialised diagnosis and treatment centres. Yet, in this most important area for citizens’ wellbeing, namely their health, our Treaties let us down disappointingly, as they place this area under the sole competence of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Strangely enough, those responsible for making and maintaining the EU Treaties seem to care more about equality in business and marketing matters than about our health. Perhaps this debate on MS will lead to some wiser thinking and be the catalyst for changing this unsatisfactory and, in many respects, shameful state of affairs for the benefit of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there are around 60 000 MS sufferers in Poland, which ranks Poland in third place after Germany and the United Kingdom. However, in those countries, around 30% of sufferers have access to immunomodulating therapy, whereas in Poland barely over 2% of patients can obtain this treatment. This is mainly due to a lack of funding and it is a problem that also affects the treatment of many other diseases, including cancer.</p>
      <p sl="pl">MS is currently an incurable disease, resulting from an impaired immune system, which leads to damage of the myelin sheath. Immunomodulating treatment is expensive, as is physiotherapy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Poland, any resolutions passed are not implemented mainly due to economic reasons and the crisis in the health service, the transformation of which has resulted in poor organisation and privatisation. The costs of medicines produced by Western companies are also prohibitively high. In my opinion, the European Parliament could try to influence these companies to prevent them from exploiting poorer patients and taking away their basic human right, namely the right to protect their health and to have access to medical treatment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like very briefly to thank the Members for this interesting and very useful debate. It will give us ideas and inspirations on how we can proceed with this important issue in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to give some information on the questions that have been posed. First of all, creating the link to the health portal is already under way; as we speak, it may have been done already. So, access to this information through the health portal will be made available to all citizens very soon, if it is not already available.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will support the creation of a European register on multiple sclerosis, which will mostly be based on the existing registers in some Member States and expanded to include the other Member States. More importantly – because we have to be practical as well –funds to support this initiative will be provided under the seventh Framework Programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">On other issues, of course, many pieces of legislation are already in place, such as the issue of discrimination and access to work. However, based on the outcome of the conference which will take place in the future, which I mentioned in my opening speech, and on the discussion with the stakeholders, we will see if there is also a need for new legislative initiatives and consider what steps have to be taken. We will then, of course, be ready to proceed with new initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, as you know, we are dealing with inequality; it is a difficult issue. It was a priority of the UK Presidency and has been taken over by the Commission and the other Presidencies as well. But we have to live within the realities – the existing legal and Treaty realities of the European Union, the issue of competences, how much the Commission can oblige Member States in certain areas of health. Most is done through guidelines and recommendations. Even under the proposed Constitution as it stands, provision of health care remains the sole competence of the Member States. So, we try to encourage, coordinate with and support the Member States, and we will raise this issue with them whenever possible but, at the end of the day, this specific area of health care provision is the responsibility of the Member States. That does not mean that we will not continue encouraging them to proceed, to follow the code that has been mentioned and to take other steps, but I believe that, through our health service initiatives (we will be presenting a proposal before the end of the year), we will be able to tackle some of these aspects and, of course, I will be happy to continue discussing these with you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, however, there is tangible, genuine hope thanks to the important and encouraging progress made through scientific research, with determined work day after day taking new steps towards identifying causes, mechanisms and cures for the neurological collapse brought on by multiple sclerosis.</p>
      <p sl="it">At this stage our chief duty is to promote, support and encourage this research, including financially; it must be free from conditions and from limitations and fears, which are often bigoted and promote other agendas.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, all the commitments made by the European Commission in its 2003 resolution must be honoured, in particular with regard to drawing up a code of best practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe that it is the specific duty of the Community institutions to promote and support the work of all associations, such as the AISM [Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association] in my country, which, with dedication and professionalism, do commendable work and provide targeted help for those affected by multiple sclerosis and their families.</p>
