      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I want to say something about the interpretation of Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure. As there has been no announcement, I gather that there has been no opposition to that interpretation. For the sake of democracy in our Parliament, I wanted to be sure that it had no retroactive effect, that it did not affect the current mandates and political agreements within the committees, and that this rule would apply to the renewal of future mandates in the parliamentary committees concerned.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Audy, I have heard your comments; indeed, you informed me of this in advance. Unfortunately, retrospective application of that interpretation would not be possible under our Rules of Procedure, so please understand that we must proceed as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has determined in accordance with the wishes of the plenary. The interpretation of Rule 191 is unambiguous. Do please understand that this is not something that I can change retrospectively. Unfortunately, in politics as in life, you generally cannot change anything after the fact. That is something we have to live with. I am very sorry about that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, if I may, I wish to make a minor correction to what you said, Mr President: Ms Jensen from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is also a member of the negotiating team.</p>
      <p sl="de">There we have it, Mr President: that is what budget experts are like, they look at every tiny detail. May I say that I greatly welcome the intensive work that you have done, in your capacity as President of this House, to increase democratic accountability in European budgetary policy, notwithstanding possible differences of opinion about the interview you gave on Saturday evening. That is for another time and place, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Kalfin and I are today presenting an interim report which is ultimately intended to speed up and facilitate the multiannual financial framework approval procedure. We do so on the basis of the work done in the past by the Special Committee on policy challenges – the SURE Committee – chaired by Ms Jutta Haug, with Mr Salvador Garriga as rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would like to express my particular thanks to the present and previous Presidencies, for what we have here is a pilot project: before and after the meetings of the General Affairs Council (GAC), a briefing and debriefing are held on the negotiating boxes discussed there, and the European Parliament’s negotiating team was also invited to attend the informal GAC meetings. Hopefully, this will result in greater mutual understanding and a way forward which is based on actual content, not prejudgements. It goes without saying, however, that this pilot project – this working method – does not, in itself, guarantee any outcomes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our analysis is not just about a magic number, incidentally. We worked very hard on content and on the challenges facing the European Union in the globalisation process. We looked at the existing multiannual programme and compared the Commission’s proposals to it, and considered how we should proceed. For us, of course, it is about numbers, and about the right numbers. It is about content, and it is about comprehensive flexibility for the annual budget procedures. It is about safeguarding own resources which are worthy of the name. At this particular time, it is also about the unity of the European budget: the Treaty is quite clear on that point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us face facts: some Member States have been talking about a magic number and yet they want to see the cohesion and agricultural policies remaining as they are; they are not interested in anything else. That does not contribute to growth and employment at a difficult time of budget consolidation. If Member States are not willing to provide enough money for the European budget, then they really need to tell us which of the political priorities that they themselves have set will be off the table in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot have successes like Erasmus, which benefits 2.5 million students, and then possibly make cuts there because we want to keep other things in cohesion or agricultural policy! We cannot say that 3 % is reserved for research and development and then cut the Commission’s proposals for Horizon 2020! We cannot claim that Europe must prepare for a new role in foreign and development policy and at the same time fail to achieve our own 0.7 % GNI spending target for official development aid. That is not how it works. This cannot enhance our credibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to focus on better spending, of course taking due account of the budget consolidation processes under way in the Member States. To that end, we have made many detailed proposals on how we can work together, on the basis of comprehensive analyses of administrative aspects and the management of the programmes, and how we can achieve better implementation. At the same time, however, we point out that programmes such as Connecting Europe and lifelong learning should not become casualties as we move forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are other issues which must also be addressed as part of this process: the debate about synergies between national and European administrations, the question of what should be regulated on the basis of subsidiarity, and where there is excessive bureaucracy which we must dismantle. For example, the Member States have 3 164 embassies and consulates around the world, with an annual budget of EUR 7.5 billion and around 95 000 employees. That is 15 times greater than the 2012 budget of the European External Action Service. So again, let us face facts: these figures should also be mentioned in the interests of truth and honesty, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we say that based on our analysis and the new challenges created by the Treaty of Lisbon, we are in favour, in principle, of contributions being set at a higher level than envisaged in the Commission’s proposals, this also has a firm basis in our analysis. That is something which the Council must understand. However, if no agreement is reached, we will not fade out of sight. What we will be left with, in that case, are the ceilings for 2013 – the ceilings, not the budget – which will remain in place until a solution is found.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, our offer, which maintains an appropriate balance between figures – and the more difficult the figures, the more comprehensive flexibility is required – means that we must send out the same clear message that Jean-Luc Dehaene and Anne Jensen have incorporated into our report. We need own resources that are worthy of the name. During the final phase, the Commission made an interesting proposal which also involves the use of the Financial Transaction Tax and, accordingly, a reduction in the national contributions of those Member States introducing this tax. In this context, it is important, in any discussion of a euro capacity or euro facility, to understand that the euro is the rule, not the exception. We cannot outsource the rule. We have to focus on the unity of the European budget so that we have a strong European Union in future too.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we take the view that the Financial Transaction Tax is an interesting option for the euro facility, for example, but we would prefer not to introduce it in the context of the European budget, I fail to understand the logic. We are maintaining these core elements of our offer and are in a position to negotiate swiftly and achieve a result as soon as possible – but not at any price!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to tell you that Parliament’s report on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) does not have a small script. We have said very clearly here everything we wanted to say to the Council at this stage. The role of this report is also very clear: to inform the Council, because the Heads of State or Government will be gathering at the end of November – and before Mr Van Rompuy begins consultations with the Member States – and to explain Parliament’s position on the next financial framework, because the Treaty says that the European Council can only adopt a decision with the agreement of the European Parliament. So we have prepared this report to facilitate the debates in the Council and to provide advance information on Parliament’s position, and we hope this is going to be voted for by a vast majority today.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is very clear and consistent and generates very significant support, as have all Parliament’s positions on the next MFF for nearly two years now. We have been working in the Committee on Policy Challenges (SURE), as Mr Böge mentioned, and have adopted different resolutions in Parliament. We have demonstrated great cross-party unity on the major principles of the next budget. The major principle is that this is an instrument. This is not an accounting exercise but an instrument to achieve political goals, to apply the provisions of the Treaty and to make the European Union viable.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to thank the Commission, especially Vice-President Šefčovič, Commissioner Lewandowski and the Presidency. The Cyprus Presidency, like the presidencies before, has done an excellent job of including Parliament in the decision-making of the Council this time – or at least we had the opportunity to express our opinion very clearly. My thanks also go to you, the President of this Parliament, and to all my colleagues who have been working on this issue, because it is an issue which really unites this House and makes our voice stronger.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want very briefly to touch on four points relating to the budget. The first is the size of the budget. I must begin by saying that the Commission’s proposal is not sufficient to finance all the political ambitions that the European Union has set. This is very clear. We have to be aware that the procedure for the next multiannual financial framework is taking place in a very difficult context. We have two challenges – confidence in the European Union and the ability of the European Union to solve these problems, and the need to make fiscal cuts and achieve fiscal consolidation at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let us see what the rationale for the European budget is. Firstly, it is not generating a deficit. This means that all the rationale for consolidating national budgets due to overspending in previous years does not hold true at European level. Furthermore, the European budget does what national budgets cannot do in these difficult times. This is an investment budget. It does everything that the national budgets are not able to do because of constraints.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, regarding confidence in the European Union, this budget has a meaning because of leverage, the additional funds that it attracts into investment in the Member States. Ninety-four per cent of the budget goes back to the Member States, and it attracts several times more investment. So a cut of one euro by the European budget would mean a cut of several euros for national, regional, agricultural and competition policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to be clear when we speak about the size of the budget. We hear very often from representatives of governments that citizens will not accept a higher European budget. We have to point out to them that we have the same voters. Citizens expect European institutions and national institutions to work together and to put forward a mechanism that will propose an exit from the economic crisis and the creation of growth and jobs, using all the instruments both at national and European level. So I would not set national institutions in opposition to European ones in this case. We have a common interest – we are working for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">If some governments need to go back to basic questions such as whether we need more Europe, whether we can do something better at European level than at national level, and whether we are able to set common goals and to fulfil them, then we are ready to re-enter this debate if it is not clear for some governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course – and Mr Böge mentioned the flexibility of the budget – in a constrained budget, flexibility is not a technical term. It refers to the possibility of really deploying resources in the most efficient way in order to achieve the goals that we have set.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will say a few words about the priorities and content of the budget. We have the traditional policies here, but we have to make sure that for the next seven years the European budget stimulates growth, the creation of growth and the creation of jobs across Europe. This is the function of the European budget. We are ready to take on board all ideas relating to better spending – to a more efficient spending of the European budget – but we need this budget in order to create jobs and growth, especially for young people. We have on many occasions heard the President of the Commission speaking in this House about youth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, just one sentence about the procedure. I want to say here in the plenary something that we have said many times to the presidencies. The MFF considers two procedures: the consent procedure for MFF-related issues and the codecision procedure for nearly 70 legal-basis documents. We do not want to see the Council taking the decision on the codecision procedure, which is the right of Parliament. We will insist on the right of this House to negotiate properly with the Member States and with the Council on all the documents related to codecision.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thank you for your kind words about our delegation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, in addition to what our rapporteurs have said, I would like to highlight two crucial points for Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, as far as Parliament is concerned, there can be no agreement on the multiannual financial framework without a political agreement on resources reform: an agreement on the principle of this reform, on the adjustments to the correction mechanisms, on the new own resources and on the calendar for implementation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone agrees. No democrat can continue to defend the European budget’s current financing system. The rebates that certain countries receive are not just. They simply reflect old balances of power. The annual decision-making procedure is devoid of any political debate and any parliamentary control. None of us here today, irrespective of the institution to which we belong, can explain to the voters how their national contribution is calculated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Eighteen months ago, the mere mention of this topic was seen as utopian. Today, the burden of proof lies with those who defend the status quo. We must thank the Commission and the Cypriot Presidency for that. Unfortunately, the real negotiations on the substance of the reform have not really begun. There is still a huge amount of work to be done to reach a global agreement on the multiannual framework in a month. That is a key point for Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second key point that I will mention is the preservation of budgetary unity. Last week’s European Council gave President Van Rompuy a mandate to develop the idea of – and I quote – ‘a fiscal capacity’ for the euro area at the December European Council. It stated that it would not be tied in any way to the negotiations on the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have to say this: for us, this issue completely overlaps today’s negotiations as we are talking about exactly the same thing. We are talking about the same thing when it comes to spending. According to those who promote this idea, we would give additional assistance to the Member States that are applying tough fiscal consolidation measures. Excellent. We can reinvent the Cohesion Fund or the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are talking about the same thing when it comes to revenue. If the revenue from this new fund comes from national contributions, then the countries that finance the fund would clearly use it as a pretext to freeze or even reduce their current contribution to the EU budget. If we think about the own resources that would be directly involved, again they will come from our EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we are talking about the same thing when it comes to the calendar. We are told: ‘it is an idea for the future, do not worry’. Of course, it will not apply on 1 January 2013, but I imagine that in the midst of the debt crisis, the European Council is not dropping everything to meet in order to take decisions that would apply after 2020, in other words, that would be applied by our successors’ successors. We are thus talking about the same calendar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, and I must be clear on this, the European Parliament will not give its agreement on the multiannual framework if it does not have a guarantee that all funds that may be created to strengthen European solidarity are integrated in the EU budgetary procedure. That is the basic principle of budgetary unity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There may be annexed budgets, annexed tables. There may be special funding for certain policies. What we cannot accept, however, is for the European budget to be frozen in time, like some sort of historical monument, at the symbolic figure of 1 %, and for all of the funds that are needed for new requirements to come from intergovernmental sources, avoiding any form of appropriate parliamentary control.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first thank you for the invitation to participate in this important debate. We all know how critical it is that we get the future multiannual financial framework right.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council attaches the highest importance to the timely conclusion of this agreement. It will give the Union the means to act and the capacity to implement its policies. The timing of the agreement is crucial, but so is the quality. We also welcome the very close cooperation on this issue with this Parliament. I am particularly grateful to Mr Lamassoure and the two co-rapporteurs for this file, Reimer Böge and Ivailo Kalfin, for their commitment to this dossier and for their determination to ensure that we reach an outcome which is acceptable to both institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cyprus Presidency has attached particular importance to continuing the practice of meeting regularly with you, and we will continue to do so until we have an agreement. I would also like to thank Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene and Ms Anna Jensen for their work on the revenue side. The Cyprus Presidency is also working very closely with the President of the European Council as the dossier moves up to the level of the Heads of State and Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last few years, the European Union and its Member States have taken important steps in response to the challenges raised by the economic and financial crisis. Looking to the future, the next MFF must ensure that the European Union’s budget is geared to lifting Europe out of the crisis in a sustainable way. We all agree that the budget must act as a catalyst for growth and jobs across Europe, in particular by leveraging productive and human capital investments. Within the future multiannual financial framework, spending needs to be mobilised in order to support growth, employment, competitiveness and convergence, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time we are all aware of the constraints under which we are working. At a time of exceptional fiscal discipline it is essential that the future MFF reflects the consolidation efforts being made by Member States to bring their deficits and debt onto a more sustainable path. We must ensure that every euro spent brings European added value and that particular attention is given under the future MFF to the quality of spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work is advancing well. You have seen the revised version of the negotiating box which we produced for the General Affairs Council in September. We also had an informal discussion in the margins of the General Affairs Council last week in Luxembourg. Your contribution through your representatives on that occasion was highly appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Later this week we will issue a revised version of the negotiating box. This will put forward an overall approach which will provide a range of figures for various qualitative elements in order to make proposals for the qualitative issues which are linked to the various spending areas. Concerning own resources, the Presidency yesterday released a non-paper to stimulate the discussion, particularly on the very sensitive issue of corrections. Discussions are of course continuing within the Council, and I am therefore not able, at this stage, to give you a clearer position on how the debate on the MFF or own resources is likely to evolve, but the Cyprus Presidency remains confident that, together with Parliament, we will soon be able to outline the parameters of agreement with greater certainty.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the President of the European Council has convened a Special European Council on 22/23 November and has announced that he is ready to prolong the meeting, should it prove necessary. The Cyprus Presidency very much shares this objective, and it is with this in mind that we are continuing to work intensively with all the Member States and yourselves in the run-up to the November meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, we have been following closely your discussions on the interim report drawn up by Reimer Böge and Ivailo Kalfin on which you will be voting later. I wish to thank both of them for their work on this report. It contains a number of important points, which we will bring to the attention of Member States. The same applies to the revenue side and own resources, Mr Dehaene’s report and the work of Ms Anne Jensen. I want to thank them, too, for their excellent work and cooperation. We have had throughout – and we hope that this will continue – an outstanding level of cooperation with committee chairman Mr Lamassoure and the whole negotiating team of the European Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally, Mr President, for your personal involvement and assistance and, most of all, your strong commitment to providing the European Union with the most important instrument in our hands for living up to our ambitions for growth and jobs for the young generation, in order for all of us to honour the contract between generations. Achieving the best possible result on the MFF for the common good of Europe is not just a priority of the Cyprus Presidency, it is a joint endeavour involving this Parliament as well as the Commission and the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the award of the Nobel Prize to the European Union, we must more than ever show European citizens that we are able to unite around a fundamental part of the European project by doing everything to make the European Union more relevant, to prove that the European Union is part of the solution and to offer to each EU citizen a better future. I look forward to hearing your views on this issue.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-018-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly we would like to thank you for the opportunity to respond to the European Parliament’s interim report on the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all agree that this proposal is probably the most important item on the agenda of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Through the decision on the MFF we are clearly sending a message to the outside world on whether we are able to deliver on Europe 2020, have enough resources to fund our common policies and can play our important role on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also all aware that, for the first time, the multiannual financial framework is being negotiated under the new treaties. Both Janusz Lewandowski and myself have been strong supporters of the clear will of Parliament to exercise its right fully. I would like to thank the Cyprus and Danish Presidencies for having established a very good framework and excellent cooperation with Parliament’s negotiating team and with the Commission. I would say, in particular, that the informal exchange of views before the last General Affairs Council was very important in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the General Affairs Council is the place where the discussions on the MFF are taking place. It is where Janusz and I have been defending the Commission’s proposals and where there is also active involvement of the European Parliament in the whole process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have studied your interim report in great detail and we very much support your starting point that this is an investment budget. We have to repeat this message again and again, because this is the message we have sometimes lost in the negotiations and in the Europe-wide discussions. We have a very strong argument on our side, because even the European Council recognised the catalysing role of the EU budget when it adopted the Compact for growth and jobs in June.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you allow me, I shall make a couple of comments on the more horizontal issues before I hand over to my colleague Janusz Lewandowski, who handles all budget questions for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, on the question of the volume of the budget, we are convinced that our proposal of 1.08 % of GNI represents a credible budget and is a balanced figure which would enable us to stabilise the financing of the CAP and the cohesion policy and allow for a noticeable increase in the EU 2020 strategy priorities. We very much appreciate the focus Parliament has put on the improved quality of the spending of the EU budget, because we would like to achieve a qualitative leap in terms of EU funding and European added value. We would like to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and simplification of their delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of the application of macro-economic conditionality, I take note of the report’s opposition to the Commission’s proposal, and I would just like to underline that the Commission’s proposal has been conceived not as coercive measures but rather to incentivise structural reforms and thus optimise effectiveness and absorption capacity. They are not meant to penalise the Member States or regions that need financial support most urgently, but rather to ensure that precious capital will actually help address the very deficiencies identified in country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On specific points raised in the report on administrative expenditure, I can confirm that the 5 % staff reduction over a period of five years is a major effort in the face of the crisis. It is an effort to which all institutions and agencies should contribute.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the issue of timing. I know that most of us in this Chamber are convinced that we need a decision before the end of the year so that we can continue with efficient spending after 1 January 2014.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-019-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start with the own resources issue. I would like to thank the European Parliament right away for giving real impetus to the reforms and discussions. After the unhappy and rapid end of previous attempts, it was the European Parliament, through its resolution, and Alain Lamassoure personally, who again initiated the attempt to reform the revenue side. Alain was the person most insistent at the time that we should go ahead with a reform of the revenue side.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s interim report contains a very forceful message – namely the unity of the budget. Unity can be understood in different dimensions, but it is essential to understand the unity of the European budget as the complementary nature of expenditure and revenue. Expenditure and revenue should reinforce each other and not stand in each other’s way. So we are agreed as to the deficiencies of the present system and the remedies. It is important to know that the Commission today decided to authorise enhanced cooperation on a Financial Transaction Tax. So the ball is now in play, as it is also with the VAT system which will replace the current – very complex – statistical VAT system.</p>
      <p sl="en">To complete the revenue side of the story: if one wants – and as London, for example, has said we need – a more transparent, simple and fair system of revenue, then we have the system of annual corrections, which is very transparent, simple and fair for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now make a few points on horizontal issues, starting with flexibility. If there are more constraints, we need more flexibility. That is clear. What is less easy to foresee are unforeseen events, so therefore the emphasis on flexibility in our package has been increased. There is also a very clear signal in this respect in your interim report, and I would like to underscore the use of the so-called contingency margin. This has been useful on several occasions under the current financial framework – for example, the economic recovery plan was made possible through contingency margin decisions – but we are basing this on the acquis accumulated in this financial period and the experience of this financial period. So we are leaving things open on how to shape flexibility properly in the 2014-2020 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the so-called ‘large-scale projects’, our decision to place Galileo in and GMS ITER outside was based on the different nature of those large-scale projects. But what is essential is to ensure their proper financing, perhaps by ring-fencing, so again here we are in agreement. We are also in agreement, I am happy to inform you, as to the infamous ‘reste-à-liquider’ (RAL). RALs are generated through annual budgeting, and the only real solution to the issue of these outstanding RAL commitments is through proper annual budgets and not through artificial devices that kill the predictability of commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">A final point concerns simplification, which is a universal request that has come from every corner of the European Union and on which we have to deliver. We have to deliver, and we have a new Financial Regulation. Inga Gräßle was a very tough partner in this negotiation, but it was very much conducive to the final goal of simplification. Now, the second stage is to ensure against the propensity to make it more complex at the level of 57 spending programmes. So we need a scan of what is sectoral, in order not to allow a watering-down of the simplification proposal under the Financial Regulation. With such important and experienced players as today’s speakers, I am sure that we can offer the European Union a decent 2014-2020 budget that provides predictability of investment for that seven-year period.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the multiannual financial framework will, quite rightly, remain in place for seven years. However, the information coming to us about the negotiations with the Council is not at all encouraging. It appears that the Council is asking for significant reductions which are out of step with the actual state of the Union and the economic crisis, because the multiannual financial framework can help indirectly.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the ‘Global Europe’ arm of the External Action Service, the European Commission has rightly proposed higher funding, and this funding is needed because the Union has to play its international role and respond to unforeseen political or other situations which arise every day. In other words, there has to be the scope and potential for the Union to use all of the available instruments to fund various interventions in relation to the countries concerned, particularly those where democracy is being restored, and to fund the External Action Service itself.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, Parliament ought to give full support to an increase in the multiannual financial framework, exactly as proposed by this House, and ought to insist on it, because if we retain the framework as the Council wants it, this will give an unacceptable message to the citizens of Europe as to how the Council of the European Union would address the substantial problems facing the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Malthusian theory, according to which we can only live in prosperity if others life in poverty, has had its day. The current stalemate poses a real risk to our commitment to the official development assistance of the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Committee on Development is very aware of this and is calling on the governments of the Member States to strongly oppose any move to treat official development assistance as a balancing item in this difficult economic climate. This would undeniably diminish the European Union’s capacity to be a strategic player in the areas of cooperation and humanitarian action, areas in which it is undoubtedly the largest, and by far the most effective, global player. It would sow doubts among our partners about the EU’s reliability in its role as a cornerstone for those who are still unable to manage by themselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, so here it is. Governments across the EU are having to tighten their belts and reduce their debt and reduce their deficit, but the solution here seems to be to increase the debt and spend even more taxpayers’ money to increase that debt; to continue with wasteful subsidies rather than focusing on the better use of existing resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the Committee on International Trade we asked for a better use of existing resources to help SMEs in the EU to access markets overseas, in order to facilitate trade. We also asked for help for entrepreneurs in developing countries to meet EU standards so that they can access our markets, create growth back in their own countries and reduce their reliance on aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, I think we should remember that spending is only one very small part of the picture. How do we return to growth? Let us ask the question: how many large EU companies which compete at the top level globally have been established in the last 20 years? Where are the Googles and the Facebooks of Europe? We should focus on completing the single market, promote entrepreneurs and make way for growth and prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the keystone of the European Union, the dimension that was lauded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is solidarity. However, there can be no solidarity without money, without a budget. We know today that over the past 14 years the national budgets have increased, on average, more rapidly than the European Union budget, and now the Member States want the EU budget to decrease more rapidly then theirs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, President Barroso wants the social model to be the spearhead of our competitiveness. The International Monetary Fund tells us that the austerity policy that we are implementing is counterproductive. Day after day, we ask the Member States to carry out structural reforms. The first of these involves investment in human capital. I do not like that expression but it is what it says. Our greatest asset is the quality of our men and women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In that regard, in the next budget, if we do not succeed in building a wall to consolidate social spending, allocating 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, we will be on the wrong track and we will not be preparing the European Union to cope with the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

The time has come to create a framework for growth, a structure that will drive our economy forward. We need investment, a uniform internal and external market, and legislation to promote growth. By taking significant steps, Europe can restore confidence. In the spirit of the 2020 strategy, as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would also particularly like to highlight the importance of creating financial resources for investment as part of industrial policy. We cannot allow the cannibalising of research and development funds to resource the ITER, Galileo, and GMES policies to continue.</p>

Young workers will only be able to find jobs if Europe is strengthened by a new industrial policy.

We therefore request increased financing for the proposals intended to strengthen public health in Europe. We request a 25 % increase in the amounts intended for climate policy, which is so important. We request that we go beyond the European Commission’s proposal with regard to the preservation of nature and conservation of biodiversity in the LIFE programme. We also request financing for civil protection. We are making these requests because the multiannual financial framework is the test that will determine whether or not the European institutions have learnt from the crisis. It is not only the amount that is in question, but also the policy orientation of this amount. What we need to know is whether the future will be austerity or solidarity, sanctions or social progress. That is the question.</p>

Firstly, the need to stimulate growth and jobs is the cornerstone of the EU’s recovery plan and its 2020 vision, and transport and the provision of much needed infrastructure can be crucial in delivering jobs and growth as part of those plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we welcome the Commission’s proposal on the Connecting Europe Facility as providing an effective tool in delivering cross-border transport infrastructure that is both sustainable and achievable.

Member States who need these solidarity instruments also benefit, but the countries which contribute more to the European budget also benefit from this money.

Although this is evidently the majority position, at this sensitive point in the negotiations I am in favour of giving full support to the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin, who have done an excellent job, providing Parliament with a strong, cohesive and united negotiating position.</p>

Indeed, the budget must be equal to the challenges posed by the agriculture of the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the proposed multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 represents a reduction in relative terms by comparison with the current MFF. This financial perspective will not result in economic and social cohesion, but in greater divergence. The intolerable cuts that some in the Council wish to impose mean that the Commission’s proposal is not sufficient or even acceptable. With regard to fisheries and maritime affairs, the proposal makes provision for an overall allocation of EUR 6.685 billion for the main financing instrument in the sector, namely the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This represents an annual average of EUR 955 million for the duration of the financial framework, which is even below the amount set aside for 2013, the final year of the current financial framework. The sums set aside for each of the years covered by the future financial framework all fall below the amount set aside for 2013. In other words, even though the current multiannual financial framework is highly insufficient, the proposal for the next one is even worse. The proposal also suggests that the already limited amounts for cohesion should be diverted to other purposes. This suggestion is reiterated by this report, which is sufficient reason for its rejection.</p>

As the spokesperson for the Committee on Culture, I have had the difficult task, at a time when we are trying to save, of calling for more funding in the areas represented by the committee, namely young people, education and culture, as well as the cultural sector. Fortunately, we have been able in our statement to lean on the Commission and the Commissioner in the area where a very ambitious plan has been proposed – an ambitious proposal – and naturally we are pleased about it, on behalf of the committee. This concerns the programmes for education, training, young people and sport, as well as the creative and cultural sector; if all goes well, they both have a chance of receiving a boost in a time of savings, and naturally this is also necessary so that we can have the necessary growth and contribute to the 2020 strategy. Today I must appeal to the Member States that have also made their feelings clear on the Commissioner’s motion and on our support, but now we must see what the finance ministers will say about it, and in any case I must urge the Council to support it too, when we come to the difficult negotiations concerning the budget.</p>

Monitor lizards have forked tongues. Perhaps that is too complex a metaphor for the Member States, so let me simply say that they have a split personality. They want to impose more and more new tasks on the European Union – and to some extent we support that with our priorities – but they are not willing to equip the EU with the capacities it needs, in terms of adequate personnel, to perform these tasks.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have heard our fellow Members talking about the different policy areas, such as agriculture, as Mr De Castro has mentioned, but also cultural policy, research, environmental policy, social policy and regional development. These are tremendously important areas for all of the Member States and for the regions which we represent. What strikes me, however, is what the Member States are not doing. They are not considering who is meant to do the work on all of these policies. Who is supposed to process the applications? Who will ensure that the projects are implemented properly and funding is channelled to where it is needed? For that to happen, we need enough staff, and these staff must be properly qualified, highly skilled employees. We need the very best people we can find! We need a multicultural workforce from many different European Union countries, with more geographical balance and outstanding language skills. What does the Council want? What do the Member States want? They want to make cuts here!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in the discussion within the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, it was unanimously concluded that the current proposal for the next multiannual financial framework does not reflect the importance of increasing investment in this area, inter alia, as a necessary and sensible response so that social rights are not further harmed in times of economic crisis. Rather than reducing financing for those specific vertical policies aimed at women’s rights, at this crucial moment we need greater intervention in these areas, by maintaining specific programmes such as the Daphne programme, by keeping gender equality as a specific objective in the Rights and Citizenship programme, by continuing to earmark funding for the European Institute for Gender Equality, and by financing small-scale women’s organisations which are carrying out crucial work in this area. In this area of women’s rights, as in other areas, what fundamentally stands out is the Commission’s desire to reduce the financing in this framework, by allocating only 0.37 % of the EU’s gross national income to the objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion.

      <p sl="es">We are not talking about expenditure, but about something political. This is a profoundly political debate; it is a debate about expenditure ceilings and political objectives, and the amount of shared resources – resources belonging to the European Union as a whole – that should be used to finance the political priorities that we, in this Chamber, have set as our objectives for the coming years and which are fundamentally linked to the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">I find entirely natural that we should be focusing on how to readjust these priorities in line with the scant resources available, because Europe is in the midst of a severe financial crisis, but it makes no sense for us to be shooting ourselves in the foot and blocking the only common instrument we have to carry out our priorities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a budget is the programme and charter of an institution since it shows what it is, what it does and above all what it intends to do in the future. We are faced with a crucial choice between a budget for mere survival or subsistence – with a little less for everyone – or a courageous budget with selective decisions, with investment in job creation, innovation, youth, in other words in the future of the European Union and its development role. It must be emphasised that, as has been stated very clearly by Mr Kalfin among others, today Europe can do what the individual Member States cannot do for the economy, for regional development and for the regions – where social cohesion will either be strengthened or die – in other words, for the lives of the very citizens we mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="it">The great European choices are today in danger of being suffocated by accounting-based disputes – within the Council and elsewhere – between net beneficiary countries and net contributors. It should be underlined that this as a false problem, because it is easy, taking account of what happened in the past, to demonstrate with figures and numbers, rather than with words, that the contributor countries actually gained, often more than the others, from the convergence of economies and growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council is currently working to add figures to the various headings. The war of positions has started: statements, stances taken by certain countries that view the budget as a mere expense item to be cut mercilessly, and even used to appease anti-European sentiment, easy to fuel at a time of crisis. This is a mistaken position that does not help the integration that we are struggling to achieve in other areas.</p>

We can see from the paper that came from the presidency yesterday, which serves as an illustration, that there are great problems with own resources. It is not a transparent system, and it is not a fair system. It should be changed, and it has also not been planned very well. However, I fear that the Cypriot Presidency is placing a great deal of emphasis on net contributions. This is the way of thinking that we must move away from. The expenditure that we put into the EU budget must reflect genuine needs and sensible policies that we implement at European level, not what the Member States should get back. To a certain extent, this is what will decide it, and so we will readily save on common expenditure on research so that we do not ultimately have to touch expenditure on agriculture and that lovely money that easily comes back to the national coffers of the finance ministries. It must not be like this. The report by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin contains six points concerning new own resources.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, President-in-Office, first, let me say that having listened to the speech by the Cypriot President-in-Office, I am shocked to hear how little passion it conveys for Europe. I simply do not get the impression that your heart is in it and that your proposals for the next multiannual financial framework reflect any genuine determination to work for the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all in the same situation in Europe. On the one hand, we understand that the Member States must consolidate their budgets. At the same time, we all know that we need to stimulate sustainable growth and that this is in our shared interests. We need to combat climate change, we have to move our economy towards a low-carbon pathway, and we have to offer our young people new prospects and, with that, new hope, which means building confidence in the European project as well. However, we cannot do so if we allow the budget to contract to the level now being proposed by the net contributors on the Council. That sends out the wrong political signal and does not reflect the spirit of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is it so important to have our own resources and above all to introduce proper regulation of the financial markets and expect them to contribute to overcoming the crisis? Because this is just. The banks must shoulder their share of the responsibility. It should not simply be the taxpayers and ordinary people who have to cover the costs of the crisis. The banks must make their contribution as well, since they speculate on the financial markets. That is why the Financial Transaction Tax is the right way forward politically and economically. It is a contribution to a social Europe and it is needed to fund the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Lewandowski has now cleverly proposed a system of incentives. The Member States would pay a lower percentage of their GDP if they participated in a Financial Transaction Tax. One-third would go to the Member States themselves and two-thirds would accrue to the EU budget. This would be a win-win situation for the Member States and would be in Europe’s interests as a whole. Hopefully, the Council will show some movement on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make one final comment, if I may: a eurozone budget has also been proposed in the political discussions. I think there are indeed good reasons for additional incentives, also in relation to the European budget, but this is about the indivisibility of the EU budget. We will not relinquish any rights of democratic control over the budget. This issue has arisen before, and regardless of whatever bright ideas some heads of state and government may have, you can be sure that we will defend our parliamentary rights with self-confidence here, and that we will continue to campaign for a genuinely and truly democratic Europe, and that applies to the budget as well.</p>

However, with resources strictly limited, is it not time that we revaluated our spending priorities for the European Union budget? It is clear that we are going to have to take tough choices in the future, and I want to stress to this House that those choices must be based on the target of achieving true, European added value.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has.</p>
      <p sl="de">So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this interim report on the multiannual financial framework offers some interesting points that we agree with, such as the need to maintain expenditure at a moderate and sustainable level and the need for greater flexibility in the use of resources. The crucial point, however, is how to finance all of this. The current mechanism is not sustainable and introduction of new forms of correction and compensation for the Member States is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last decade Italy’s average annual net contribution has been about EUR 5 billion. Northern Italy must at the same time support a country that is falling apart and a Europe that acts only in the interests of Germany and a few other countries. The United Kingdom, Germany and other countries have obtained corrections they now wish to retain. This is not possible, unless we are also to introduce a correction for the Po Valley area, in order to compensate for what the citizens of Northern Italy contribute to central government in Rome and to Brussels, with very little in return.</p>

Fortunately, the British Prime Minister has already threatened to use his veto on the ‘billions budget’ and I advise our Dutch Premier, Mr Rutte, to do the same. Why?</p>
      <p sl="nl">To teach the Commission that it cannot threaten national parliaments with impunity. To remind the Commission that it is those same national parliaments that make the decisions on the European purse and not the Euro-clique here.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the report by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin reflects and highlights the priorities decided by Parliament in the report of the Special Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Resources for a Sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE report). The European Union budget represents an indispensable tool in solving the effects of financial crises. We are discussing here a budget of which 94 % is reinvested in Member States and which needs to be used for creating economic prosperity through investments and creation of new jobs. The austerity measures were necessary, but to be effective they need to be complemented by measures that catalyse the economy. For this reason the budget enlargement is indispensable and freezing ceilings at their 2013 level is not an option. The perception of the Union’s budget and the gridlock created in the new multiannual financial negotiations can only be changed by an in-depth examination of the own resources system. A new system for collecting VAT and the taxes on financial transactions are two innovative directions that must benefit from our unconditional support.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Referring to our activities in the European Parliament I believe that the strategy authorised by the contact group is leading us, in the case of a proposal under the threshold proposed by Parliament, to a negative vote. In the event that there is no certainty that a sufficient number of members will vote against the Council’s decision, there will be a delay unfavourable to the European Union. The strength of the European Parliament is in its co-decision procedure. Trust must be extended to all members of this Parliament so as to allow the normal negotiations within the European political files, horizontal files. It is possible that such an approach will change the position of many Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the next multiannual financial framework and the amount of funding and the policies we want to finance are the focus of our discussions and disagreements here as we seek to reach a consensus, but this is only one side of the coin, namely the expenditure side. However, we must work on the other side of the coin as well, namely the revenue side. That is nothing new. For almost 20 years, the European Parliament has been calling for a more transparent, fairer and simpler system of own resources. Now, for the first time, we can lend weight to this demand.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the SURE report last June, we called for a system of own resources which would abolish all of the rebates and make the revenue side of the EU budget completely independent of the contributions made by Member States. The Commission took account of these demands, at least to some extent, by proposing a reform of own resources from valued added tax and the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax. We support this proposal by the Commission, even though it only amounts to a 40 % reform. It is at least a step forward, and what is more, it moves in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was intended to be an expression of gratitude but also an incentive to go further. A more peaceful approach could also be achieved if the constant bean-counting between the net contributors and the net recipients were consigned to the past following a reform of the revenue system. A genuinely European revenue stream would also highlight the European value added of the EU budget. Then this constant small-minded national bean-counting could finally stop.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my UK Liberal Democrat colleagues and I support a great deal of what is in the resolution here today. We support a move to own resources allowing Europe to raise more of its own funding while reducing Member States’ GNI contributions. We support a more flexible budget allowing Parliament to switch spending in-year and, most importantly, allowing end-year under-spends to be rolled over into the next financial year instead of being handed back to Member States. We also support spending on growth and jobs and the objectives of the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also want to see a genuine mid-term review of the MFF budget in 2017 so that the ceilings can be looked at again if and when – as we all hope – growth has returned and austerity is on the retreat.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where we cannot agree is on the size of the budget. In my own Member State, welfare benefits are being cut, health and education spending is frozen and wages are frozen or declining. It is therefore impossible to justify any significant increase in the EU budget.

Those in favour of a ‘small budget’ stress the need to cut all public spending, while advocates of a ‘large budget’ underline how this expenditure will boost growth for Europe as a whole. What interests me, however, is something entirely different. I would like someone to explain to me how it is that the Christian Democrats and Socialists in this Chamber are talking about a ‘large budget’, while in Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg and, finally, France and Germany, these same political parties intend to cut this budget. Is it not the case that it is very easy for Christian Democrats and Socialists to talk about a large budget in this Chamber, when they know very well that their political interests and a reduction in European Union funding are safeguarded in the Council as a result of the pressure exerted by their own parties? If that is true, the European Parliament risks damaging its reputation and attracting ridicule, while the defence of European solidarity staged here is nothing more than play-acting at negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this House is stretching the meaning of the word ‘investment’ beyond elasticity. Can any MEP claim that the many billion euros of taxpayers’ money spent on the Lisbon Agenda have delivered any return? Let us look at the evidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat. We should also not forget that the Court of Auditors has not given EU spending an overall clean bill of health for over a decade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The MFF has been built around a legacy of failed projects, and the 2014-2020 MFF simply seeks to top up those failed projects.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to mention four risks which I think are related to the MFF negotiations. Firstly, the decision on the multiannual financial framework is not taken in November. How can we explain to citizens that they cannot count on the EU budget as a catalyst for jobs and growth? We have to make it very clear to the Member States – who will come to the negotiating table to say no – that the Treaty allows us to have the budget even if they block the decision. The only challenge will be to identify the legal basis for launching new investment programmes, and we will find it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, corrections. I agree that they are crucial for the process. So far the debate has focused on expenditure. The corrections should be transparent, temporary and few in number. The debate begins only now, and I believe that it would be irresponsible to move to a growing number of national corrections. This will make the decision in November impossible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the risk of the traditional VAT system – which deserves retirement – not being replaced by a new, feasible system is rather high, so we might end up with an increased role for GNI and a vague commitment to own-resources reform in the future. It would be a shame if we could not afford it any more.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, on behalf of my committee, let me say regarding cohesion policy that we should not depart from the major mission of the policy, which is investing in growth – but with a view to reducing the structural disparities, which means that the national and regional allocation criteria should respect the Berlin methodology.</p>

It would be good if what Vice-President Šefčovič said about the seven-year budget being a budget for development and investment were true. I have my doubts, however, when I see the way the future of the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds is shaping up, and especially their internal organisation. I have to say that this is one of the biggest challenges for the new Member States, given that a great deal of the development and investment that has taken place has come from the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.</p>

Firstly, an appeal to get the MFF sorted by the end of the year and, secondly, a challenge. Mr Böge, the rapporteur, put this well when he said that, if they want reductions, they had better justify them and tell us where they want them. Is it CAP? Is it cohesion funding? Is it Horizon 2020? And on what basis? Our funding here in Europe is always justified on the basis of adding value. If they can show that it does not add value, then we have no argument, but I think they will find that very difficult to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I want to make is that the second part of our discussion this morning is on own resources.

Have they already forgotten the Lisbon Strategy objective of becoming the most dynamic and competitive economy by 2010? Can they remember the regrettable state in which we found ourselves in 2010? Are they forgetting that we are setting out a strategy for 2020? Or are these only words?

At a time when all of the countries of the Union and their citizens are having to make substantial savings, the Commission, too, must make a contribution to the consolidation of Union savings and be flexible in reassessing the priorities in line with the current economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I personally support solidarity within the European Union and I am convinced that there is a need to look for model solutions not only to bring about a fair redistribution of financial resources, but also to prevent such financial resources being squandered on projects that, in a spirit of solidarity, do not bring the developing parts of Europe bonuses that might help them to achieve economic growth.</p>

The budget for the common agricultural policy is 12 % lower in real terms, while the proposed CAP reform reduces its competitiveness and imposes additional objectives for which there is no funding. The report misguidedly proposes dealing with Pillars I and II jointly when assessing the CAP. The Pillar I budget is based on old, historical calculations – on criteria that have long since lost all relevance. The budget for Pillar II is based on objective, coherent criteria.

If there were to be a reduction in financing in this area, we would not be able to achieve the Council’s recently adopted ambitions and objectives or the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

I would very much like the Council to consider the current state of the budget and what will happen if we do not keep our promises.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the multiannual financial framework must reflect the political ambitions of the European Union set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and respond to the expectations of citizens of the European Union. The budget should remain clearly reasoned, stimulating and, above all pro-growth, so that the economic crisis is definitively overcome as quickly as possible, and the Union can increase employment and the prosperity of its citizens, and cement its standing on world markets.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The cohesion policy therefore requires appropriate financial resources. These resources should in any case not be less than in the current programme period. Just the opposite, the budget for the cohesion policy should be further increased, since the disbursements represent strategic investments in the added value field.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, colleagues, thank you for your comments. There is no multiannual financial perspective without the consent of European Parliament – that is clear. Therefore your voice and your vote are important and should be helpful in the very exceptional circumstances in which Europe finds itself today. It is also a sign of good institutional cooperation, with each institution having an important role to play – including the national parliaments – with regard to the issue of own resources and taxation: no taxation without representation. That is my answer to Mr Hartong, who usually makes critical comments and leaves the room instead of listening to the answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a part of this rational construction I admired for so many years from behind the Iron Curtain. It is absolutely right to place the multiannual framework in the context of the realistic growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda for Europe. It makes a difference whether this is just a political announcement or an agenda equipped with money. The European budget is about the multiannual predictability of investment in Europe with a shortage of investment money in the national budgets. The European Parliament has a clear role to play when it comes to the proper level of budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our technical update for cohesion was not very fortunate, given the recent figures, but we cannot make the other basis for the ‘Berlin methodology’ in relation to cohesion. The recent figures, as updated, which are not fortunate for cohesion, are the only ones on which we can base our calculations with safeguards for countries like Hungary, which have experienced some problems in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding own resources, your important message is on the unity of the budget. We can understand unity as also not being a fan of the second budget for the European Union, but this is a unity of a complementary nature of revenues and expenditure. The proposal on the table, supported by the European Parliament, is really a fair, transparent and simple response to everybody who wants a simple, transparent and a fair system of own resources. If we manage to achieve real reform where revenue is concerned, we deserve another Nobel Prize. The same goes for simplification, which has been requested in the soon-to-be 28 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Parliament has an important role to play at the level of expenditure. This is a modest proposal: comparisons with national budgets are not fair. No single Member State has in the past had to accommodate such a major enlargement in terms of geography. We are to be 28, not 27, in the next financial perspective, and we are to have many more powers and areas of responsibility at European level. Therefore I cannot resist several comparisons. Yes, our annual budgets are less than the annual budgetary deficits of some Member States. I cannot resist pointing out that the UK’s contribution to the European budget is on a par with that country’s contribution to its fire service, and less than it contributes to its prison service. It is 14 times less than the servicing of the UK debt. That is not the problem of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members very much for this debate. I fully understand that some of you – and of course this is just a euphemism – do not support an approach which would reduce the overall size of the MFF. I very much appreciate, however, your frankness on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are well aware that there is also a divide between Member States on this issue. I hope you appreciate that there are valid and strong arguments on both sides and different approaches regarding the best way to achieve our targets. I would like to reassure you that we are working hard on the revenue side and will soon come forward with more details regarding our approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some very important institutional issues with regard to the EU budget in the aftermath of last week’s European Council were raised by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, and other distinguished speakers. I will refrain, if you will allow, from commenting on them, especially since later this morning we will have the opportunity to discuss them directly with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I will comment briefly on what Ms Jensen had to say. With all due respect, I do not think that in our paper we either expressed support for the ‘juste retour’ or referred to direct payments as a holy cow. We just raised issues and questions for consideration. But maybe I did not fully grasp the gist of your point.</p>
      <p sl="en">On FTT, we all know that it has proved impossible to fly at the level of 27. Now we are advancing with enhanced cooperation, and the Presidency is fully committed to moving this forward. But we need to be aware that this enhanced cooperation is not about an own resource but rather a national resource. It is not FTT as an own resource. What we are trying to do in the current exercise on the MFF is to find a way to establish a link between the revenue accrued in Member States participating in enhanced cooperation with own resources with a corresponding reduction to their GNI contribution. But we need to be fully aware that there are both legal and political obstacles in some Member States which otherwise would like to participate in the FTT-enhanced cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to emphasise – and reassure those Members who spoke on this issue – that a focus on less-developed regions is one of the few non-controversial issues in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we say that the level of the MFF will unavoidably have to be revised downwards and that all headings and sub-headings will have to be affected, we are not expressing a wish. We are trying, as honest brokers, to provide radiography – an accurate presentation of the current situation. The same applies to questions regarding staff, raised in particular by Ms Roth-Behrendt. There again we need to get the right balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me once again insist on the fact that the Council has not yet come to a decision on the MFF and that discussions are continuing in a pragmatic way and with the full commitment of all – I stress of all – Member States towards reaching a timely compromise. Of course we all work on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will study very carefully and give full consideration to your interim reports, both on MFF and on own resources based on value added tax.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also listened very carefully to the views expressed here this morning and I can assure you that I will bring them to the attention of colleagues within the Council. Osmosis between the work of institutions is a key word for the Cyprus Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for your contributions to this debate, which to a large extent have supported the positions presented in our interim report. I would ask you to continue to support our report in today’s vote. I would also like to reiterate my thanks to everyone who worked on this text. May I say on a personal note that the cooperation with Ivailo Kalfin, the members of the negotiating team and the contact group has been one of my most positive experiences as a rapporteur in this House, and I hope that we can sustain this to the end so that we have the chance to achieve a positive outcome together.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the Cypriot Presidency, the Presidency of the European Council, now unveils a new negotiating box – a range of figures, as Andreas Mavroyiannis has said – this will take us into a new phase in the negotiating process. So let me be quite clear: after the vote on this interim report, we are willing to negotiate from now until 22 November on all of the issues relating to the multiannual financial framework and on all of the details of the interinstitutional agreement, wherever this is necessary to work together to identify solutions which result in an acceptable compromise. It is up to the Presidency to make use of this offer so that it can be integrated into the Conclusions and the debate at the European Council meeting on 22-23 November. Ultimately, and this needs to be reiterated, the outcomes or agreements reached by the European Council are a political agreement, and nothing other than a negotiating mandate for the Council so that it can finally achieve a positive outcome with Parliament in the weeks thereafter. First of all, Parliament must give its approval, by a majority of its Members, so that the Council can then make a unanimous decision. That is something that this institution should never forget in this procedure!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to thank all colleagues for the debate today. With this debate, and hopefully with the vote a little later, Parliament will give a very clear signal to the Council. I am sure that the Presidency will take that message to the Council itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three important issues that we have to take from the debate. First, the budget needs to be sufficient. Therefore, any decrease in the budget will be accepted with difficulty. We have mentioned several times that we will not accept a haircut approach to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the budget has to be highly targeted. We are ready to discuss any ideas on better spending of the monies under the European budget, and we want to see these being used exactly for the purposes for which the EU budget is needed and expected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, this budget has to help the Member States do something that they cannot do on the basis of their national budgets, which is to help them with additional instruments to create growth and jobs in the Member States, because all taxpayers have an interest in this happening. These messages have to reach the Council and be understood before the Council takes a decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also insist on the possibility of negotiating all the instruments contained in the legal basis. Again, whatever the Council decides will be taken into consideration, but we will not give up our right to negotiate on the legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word on own resources. I am very happy to hear from Commissioner Lewandowski that the Commission is going to start the procedures for enhanced cooperation for the FTT, but the FTT has to be an own resource and has to make it easier for the Member States to reduce their GNI-based contributions. We do not want a bigger European budget; we want a more stable European budget, and we will fight for it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the tougher the negotiations and the more parties around the table, the greater the temptation to agree to continue what has already been done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unanimity is necessary. Indeed, there is one thing on which we all agree: the previous agreement. We just need to continue. No one will win, but no one will lose. Everyone will keep their slice of the cake and everyone will avoid losing face. That is what we did previously, despite the efforts of Reimer Böge and our rapporteurs at the time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, in fact, the Cypriot Presidency is publishing a document on the ‘resources’ part of the budget. Its reference is the Fontainebleau agreement, approved by the European Council in 1984. That was 28 years ago. The European Union did not exist then. Cyprus and Poland, for example, were not Member States. The economic community was limited to 10 Western states. The Iron Curtain had torn the continent apart. China was struggling to combat widespread famine. The idea of a single European currency was raised only at academic conferences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are in a new century, we are in a new world, we are in a new Europe. Four successive Treaties have resulted in a significant increase in the competences of the Union, which now has three times as many members. Everything is new, expect the budgetary framework. We have a historic responsibility. Our generation of heads of government, ministers, Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament would be disgraced if Europe found itself in 2020 with a budget whose amount, financing and distribution had been designed to cope with the needs we had 30 years ago.</p>

In the present economic context we have to concentrate on measures that can improve the economy and overcome the economic and financial crisis facing us. Part of the solution is having an internal market that functions properly, and the only way to make this possible is by appropriate financing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are well into the process of implementing the Single Market Act. I believe that the MFF should provide the necessary financial means for implementing the commitments made.</p>
      <p sl="ro">SMEs are another important element for economic growth and job creation, which means that the MFF should provide strong support for an EU policy aimed at improving SMEs access to finance. No less important is the consumer protection policy, with its ultimate objective of empowering consumers. It is not possible to have a properly functioning internal market without adequate infrastructure; the Connecting Europe Facility represents an important step towards creating a single energy market and a digital single market while enhancing free movement of goods, services and people.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Parliament has taken a decisive stance against reducing the 2014–2020 European Union budget since inadequate levels of funding could jeopardise, among other things, the EU’s new strategy for growth, the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and economic growth. I would like to stress that not only must the overall budget remain intact, but within it, so must the budget for regional policy for the period 2014–2020. Cohesion policy plays a vital role in achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as being essential if we are to overcome the economic crisis. It is a key pillar of the ‘intelligent growth’ which the EU considers so important, a strategic tool for investment and competitiveness, and one of the main embodiments of European solidarity. For these reasons, funding for cohesion policy needs to remain at least at the level of the 2007–2013 period. In view of this I think it is unacceptable that the Commission’s proposal would mean that Hungary is the only EU Member State where per capita GDP in the period 2014–2020 will consistently be less than 75 % of the EU average, while its cohesion support could fall by nearly 30 % relative to the current budgetary period. I consider the low growth ceilings set and the growth projections used to determine support levels unfair and counter to the spirit of the EU Treaties because they hit countries with the lowest growth levels hardest and hence keep them trailing behind in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The next budget of the European Union should reflect the increased range of functions and ambitions of the EU: it is impossible to finance closer cooperation, and economic, financial and political union with fewer resources. The budget must be geared towards growth and employment, enhanced competitiveness, and cohesion for less developed regions. Reducing the European budget would inevitably impede growth and competitiveness, goals reinforced by common agreement and which we need to achieve if we are to overcome the crisis. In many Member States today, EU support represents the only basis for economic growth. Expenditure cuts would increase the gulf between the developed and less developed regions, between affluent segments of the population and those living in poverty, undermining one of the EU’s most important fundamental principles, solidarity. For this reason it is vital to make our position clear: the European Parliament opposes freezing the budget at its current level or reducing it. Of particular relevance here is the demand put before Parliament by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that in the next EU budget commencing in 2014 a quarter of the Cohesion Fund resources should be spent on projects aimed at promoting employment, social inclusion and poverty reduction. Equally vital in my view is providing more generous support in the 2014-2020 budget for programmes aimed at promoting human rights and enforcing the rights inherent in European citizenship. We must resolutely reject any attempts to produce a future budget for the eurozone that is detrimental or counter to the interests of the EU27.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Parliament’s position on the multiannual financial framework must be clear and rigorous: the budget amount recommended by the Commission should not be reduced. A reduced budget in the European Union would have a negative impact on economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU, and would weaken its cohesiveness, solidarity and ability to overcome the crisis. Any reduction would restrict opportunities to ensure a fairer distribution of direct payments and proper financing of the cohesion policy. I can only support the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who recently, in Bratislava, stated at a meeting of the Friends of Cohesion group that Europe needs political unity – the wealthier countries must agree to a wide-ranging policy, which provides for support for the less wealthy regions of Europe, since this is an investment in the growth of the European Union as a whole. I understand the political difficulties in many Member States when the EU budget is discussed. However, together with the rapporteur I would like to remind you that the EU budget represents only some 2 % of total government expenditure in the Union, and is hence more than 45 times smaller than the sum of government expenditure in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would first of all like to say that the macroeconomic measures for the financial stabilisation of the EU adopted since 2008 have not yet been found to be adequate and effective in overcoming the economic crisis. We also have the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy. For these reasons, it is appropriate to put forward the MFF 2014–2020 as an essential condition for strengthening European economic governance and for supporting the objectives set in the above mentioned strategy for smart and sustainable growth in support of social inclusion. The MFF and the EU budget together are one of the instruments that should both help in allocating investment into activities increasing growth and employment and help Member States in their structural reforms. The correct identification of investment priorities (human capital and education, development of the knowledge-based society, infrastructure, research and innovation, small and medium enterprises, green and new technologies) and coordination of them in the Member States should kick-start economic growth in the EU. Among other things, the report stresses the importance of supporting research and innovation, the policies of cohesion and general competitiveness in the EU, including financing of large infrastructure projects (ITER, GMES, Galileo) and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. It can generally be stated that the report submitted by Mr Böge and Mr Kalfin provides a clear analysis of the MFF and reflects the comments of the EP, and I therefore recommend that it be approved as it stands.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament is an institution that represents all European Union citizens and, as such, must play a specific role in determining the next multiannual financial framework. In particular, it is worth actually thinking of cohesion policy as an EU investment policy that helps to achieve a systematic rise in the population’s standard of living. That is why it is also better to avoid earmarking as much as 25 % of regional funds for the European Social Fund, as, however important its role in promoting employment and tackling social exclusion, it is cohesion policy that serves more effectively to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. At the same time, special EU support programmes benefiting the poorest should be maintained. The multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 should also bring us closer to achieving full convergence of direct payments across the EU under the common agricultural policy. However, even rural development measures financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) differ in nature depending on the size and state of development of rural areas in the individual Member States. For that reason, country-specific allocations of EAFRD monies should be retained. Parliament must also firmly oppose all attempts to reduce rural development funding as contrary to the objective of social and economic cohesion within the EU.</p>

      <p sl="el">As regards cohesion policy, here, too, the message is very clear: this policy is the only European growth policy and as such it must continue to be available in all regions of Europe. Cohesion policy is the main part of the response to the crisis, because it contributes decisively to growth and job creation, and it deserves and is entitled to adequate funding. For this reason, the European Parliament maintains that the financing of cohesion policy must be maintained at least at the 2007-2013 level. By maintaining the current budget level and with an up-to-date, targeted, results-oriented cohesion policy, I am confident that we will achieve much more.</p>

      <p sl="en">A democratic, stable and prosperous neighbourhood, sharing the values of the EU, is clearly in the EU’s interest. To achieve this goal, we should take political and financial responsibility and be prepared to offer Eastern Partners further support and clear prospects for an enhanced relation with the EU. The Commission has committed to grant additional support to those neighbouring countries undertaking significant political, economic and social reforms. In the time-frame of the MFF several Eastern Partnership countries could have in force an Association Agreement, including a DCFTA. Association Agreements would contain strong commitments by the Eastern Partners to legal approximation and structural reforms in many areas, like trade, for which the EU has promised to provide financial and technical assistance. Political association and economic integration of the Eastern Partners will be successful only if the necessary financial support is provided. In this context, and in the light of the latest ‘MFF negotiating box’ presented by the Council Presidency, I demand again that the level of financial resources envisaged in the proposal of the European Commission for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework is at least maintained to enable the EU to play its key role for the development of these countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after a brief, but heartfelt, welcome of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which was felt by all to be a tribute to past work and an invitation to redouble our efforts for the future, the focus of last week’s European Council was on the economic issues, namely the implementation of the Compact on Growth and Jobs approved last June and the discussion on the interim report on deepening economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
      <p sl="en">We also spent time on some foreign policy questions and touched on a matter which I know is of concern here, the appointment to the vacant seat on the Board of the European Central Bank, which was raised both by me and by your President in his speech at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Union’s commitment to promoting the equality of women and men is an objective laid down in the Treaty. Yesterday’s vote by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the appointment is an understandable expression of concern that a great deal remains to be achieved, notably regarding the European Central Bank. But I note also the committee’s recognition that the candidate’s professional competences are in no way in dispute.</p>
      <p sl="en">For my part, at last week’s European Council, I made a strong appeal to all Heads of State or Government to identify and propose female candidates for vacant posts at European level, in particular in the economic and financial sectors, where the under-representation of women is blatant. I underlined that we need to be active in encouraging this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that, with such renewed commitment to gender balance, Parliament will base its final decision on the current candidate for the ECB executive board on the sole criteria of professional qualification and experience. It is urgent to fill that vacancy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now let me move on to the economic questions which were at the core of our discussions. First, growth and jobs. We are still suffering from a lack of growth – 25 million people are unemployed in the Union, many of whom are young people. Overall growth projections for next year are at best modest. I am painfully aware of the toll this is taking on our societies. In several countries, the adjustment is more severe and lengthy than many had expected. Reining in budgetary deficits and restoring competitiveness would have been necessary even without the crisis in the eurozone. It is therefore all the more necessary to share the burden of this adjustment fairly and to have policies especially targeted at reducing unemployment. Here, the EU instruments can and should assist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Creating jobs and boosting socially-inclusive growth remains our utmost priority and our ultimate goal. The commitments made under the Compact for Growth and Jobs cannot wait: they must be followed by decisive action and translated into concrete results. This is particularly urgent for the implementation of the EUR 120 billion package we agreed in June, for progress on the single market issues and on our EU-2020 goals. It is also urgent for measures supporting social inclusion, promoting research and development, developing the competitiveness of our industries, and harnessing the potential of international trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meanwhile, we will discuss in November the multiannual financial framework at the European Council. We need a growth-oriented EU budget. Although it represents only 1 % of European GDP, it can, as an investment budget, have a huge impact on growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, restoring confidence in the eurozone is a key part of bringing back internal demand and growth. On this, we can now witness the first results of our cumulative actions. Let me give a few examples. The so-called spreads are decreasing significantly in almost all eurozone countries. Public deficits are now lower in most countries. Competitiveness and export performances are stronger in all countries. The upcoming common bank supervisor is a major breakthrough and we launched two weeks ago the European Stability Mechanism so that our ‘firewall’ now amounts to EUR 700 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the specific case of Greece, significant progress has been made. The eurozone Heads of State and Government issued a statement welcoming the determination of the Greek Government to deliver on its commitments and also commending the remarkable efforts of the Greek people. The Eurogroup will examine this progress in light of the forthcoming troika report and take any necessary decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our second major debate was on the interim report which I drew up in collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank – a group of four presidents who also met with your President, Martin Schulz. My office also consulted Member States and the European Parliament’s delegation, whose contribution was significant. I also personally met some of your rapporteurs, coordinators and committee chairs. This was an interim report seeking to clarify concepts and test the level of support for various ideas that have arisen, with the aim of reaching conclusions in December. It highlighted points of convergence and outlined areas that would require further work. The European Council gave a mandate to continue this work and propose a specific and time-bound roadmap to be presented at its December meeting so that it can move ahead on all the essential building blocks on which genuine EMU should be based.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our immediate priority was progress on financial integration. In June, we agreed to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. The urgent element now is setting up a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) to prevent banking risks and cross-border contagion from emerging. That is why the European Council called for swift progress, with the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework by 1 January 2013. Once this is agreed, the SSM could become effectively operational during 2013. This places a huge responsibility on all of us to meet this ambitious timeline. We cannot afford to risk losing momentum.</p>
      <p sl="en">When establishing a Supervisor, several aspects need to be taken into consideration. First, there must be a clear separation between the monetary responsibilities of the ECB and its supervisory functions. The ECB should be able to carry out supervision directly in a differentiated manner, meaning using national authorities in supervisory tasks as much as possible. The SSM will be designed and implemented with the integrity of the single market for financial services in mind. Finally, the mechanism should be inclusive and transparent: all Member States are free and invited to join. This openness should be reflected in the governance structure, with appropriate rights and obligations for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">The SSM is a first, essential step towards a complete, integrated framework for the financial sector. Other steps also need to be taken quickly, starting with harmonising national resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, following which the Commission will propose a single resolution mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">As agreed in June, direct recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism will be possible once an effective SSM has been established. We asked the Eurogroup to draw up the exact operational criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">For a stable economic and monetary union, we also need stronger integrated frameworks for budgetary matters and economic policies. On both these fronts we have already done a lot. Let me put it this way: if we fully use all our tools – the six-pack, the forthcoming two-pack, the European Semester with its country specific recommendations, the new macroeconomic imbalance procedure and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance – then we will have already taken a major step towards fiscal and economic union. Yet to secure the eurozone’s long-term stability, we also need to be able to better deal with economic shocks and spur economic convergence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, some new avenues in my report attracted attention. I received a mandate, together with my colleagues, to explore them further between now and December. One of these is that Member States could enter into individual arrangements of a contractual nature with the EU institutions on the reforms they commit to make, in response to the country specific recommendations of the Council, to promote growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another is the possibility of an appropriate fiscal capacity for the euro area. This new idea requires further exploration and it was agreed that this is unrelated – I emphasise ‘unrelated’ – to the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will be crucial for the new EMU to be fully legitimate and accountable. As a general principle, we all agree that democratic control should occur at the level where decisions are taken. It is also important to build this deeper economic and monetary union on the EU’s institutional and legal frameworks, and to make sure that it remains open and transparent towards Member States outside the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in all our regular European Councils, I wanted to devote some time to strategic discussions on our external relations and our foreign policy. We focused on two main issues. First, our relations with China – taking a step back and looking at the long term. I debriefed the European Council on the September Summit with China, a very positive one. As you know, this key partner is undergoing a ‘once in a decade’ leadership change. We exchanged views on how to engage constructively with the new leadership. We must pass on the same messages to Beijing, both the easy and the difficult ones, in our contacts at all levels. China presented a package of proposals for future cooperation between the EU and China. We will respond in the same spirit with our own proposals. We will come back to this issue to prepare the next summit, which should take place in China in autumn 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we addressed crisis areas in the world: Syria, Iran and Mali. This was indeed the first time that we had discussed developments in Mali at European Council level. The situation has a security, humanitarian and regional impact on the Sahel. It could also become a threat to our own societies and to our own security. The Union is contributing to the international efforts led by the United Nations to stabilise the situation. We decided to accelerate our own planning for a possible European military crisis management operation and support for the international military force, in accordance with the recent UN Security Council Resolution 2071.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, this was a positive summit. It is good for Europe that we will have a single supervisory mechanism up and running in the course of 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Between now and December we will work on further progress to reinforce our economic and monetary union. The biggest contribution to growth in the short term is restoring confidence in the eurozone.</p>

    <intervention id="2-085-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, last week’s European Council was the first in a series of three summit meetings this autumn. Our objective in these meetings is to reach decisions which will have a significant impact both on short-term stability and our longer-term objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">First and foremost, we must deliver on the Compact on Growth and Jobs agreed in June. The reality is that the crisis is still with us: too many of our Member States are facing recession; unemployment remains worryingly high (with the potential to further undermine social cohesion), and I am painfully aware of the difficult situation in which many European citizens find themselves. Implementing the growth compact is, therefore, much more than a demonstration of our political will; it is a question of fairness and equity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some of our Member States, citizens are making major sacrifices because of the situation resulting from excessive debts in the public sector and irresponsible financial behaviour in the private sector. This is why we need to provide citizens with hope, and a realistic prospect that growth and jobs will return and that the most vulnerable in society will not suffer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has delivered a great number of proposals and inputs to underpin the Growth Compact. However, the reality is that this Growth Compact, including an important investment package worth EUR 120 billion, has not yet been fully implemented. Some progress has been made, but frankly it is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">I presented to the Heads of State and Government a detailed report describing what is on the table, where the blockages exist, and what the next steps are. It is high time that proposals on negotiation tables became reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give some examples. Agreement is within reach on the proposals on venture capital, accounting and alternative dispute resolution in the next two months. But work on several other proposals that are crucial for growth and fairness in the single market needs to be accelerated. Public procurement reform; a tax on savings, including mandates for agreements with third countries; professional qualifications; e-signatures: we need to give a new political push in all these areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week I urged the Member States’ governments to do their utmost to bring the Compact on Growth and Jobs to life. Likewise, I count on this House to assume its responsibility and play its part in finalising legislation on its elements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us demonstrate to our citizens that Europe carries a message for growth and jobs. When talking about growth, it is clear that the financial sector must also make a fair contribution to recovery. I welcome in particular the recent progress on a European Financial Transaction Tax. Following the requests we have now received from 10 Member States, this very afternoon the Commission will make a proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation. This will be the first step in the process. We will also present an action plan on tax fraud and tax evasion – including tax havens – before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to confirm to you that, following the adoption of the employment package, the Commission will introduce a Youth Guarantee Scheme before the end of the year. This will aim to ensure that young people are presented with either the offer of a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of being unemployed or leaving formal education. This will be supported by the European Social Fund. We will also introduce a quality framework for traineeships to help young people in their transition from education to work. We are taking these measures to prevent a ‘lost generation’ in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not just the Compact on Growth and Jobs where we have to turn political will into reality. It is essential that by the end of this year there is agreement on the single supervisory mechanism for banks. This is also a pre-condition for the direct recapitalisation of banks under the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">By reaching agreement on this, the European Union has a huge opportunity to restore confidence, demonstrate its capacity to take difficult decisions in times of crisis and send a message of stability. Let us not fail to seize this moment. And let us also be clear about one thing: reaching agreement on these issues is a fundamental precondition if we want to be credible in our further deepening of economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Single Supervisory Mechanism for banks, without prejudice to the ongoing legislative process, the European Council confirmed many of the key principles on which the Commission proposals were grounded. This includes being as open as is legally possible to all Member States who want to participate. As we have stated time and time again, we do not need new walls in Europe between the euro area and non-euro area members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need proper accountability at the level at which decisions are taken, which for the Commission clearly means to this Parliament, and maintaining the level playing field and the integrity of the single market. This also includes tasking the ECB with responsibility for prudential supervision and the power to intervene, if needed, with any bank in the euro area, as well as a clear separation of this supervisory function and monetary policy. We will continue to work closely with the European Parliament on all these matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">One important element is the political commitment of the Heads of State and Government that agreement should be reached by the end of this year. I hope that the governments will now respect the commitment they have taken at the highest level. Let us not forget why we are acting here: we are advancing in our response to the crisis. We need to definitively break the negative link between bank debt and sovereign debt – and this is urgent. That is why the Commission put its proposals on the table within weeks of the June European Council. Delivering the single supervisory mechanism will give a very important signal to our citizens, but also to our international partners and to investors in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council also spelled out the need for rapid adoption of the provisions relating to the harmonisation of national resolution and deposit guarantee frameworks based on the Commission’s legislative proposals on bank recovery and resolution and on national deposit guarantee schemes. It also called for a rapid conclusion of the single rule book, including agreement on the proposals on bank capital requirements. This House has a decisive role to play in all these matters, and the Commission will work closely with you in the coming weeks to move ahead quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before I look at the other, longer-term elements of deepening EMU, let me start by underlining how crucial it is to finalise the legislation known as the ‘two-pack’. The prior coordination of national budgets is one important pillar of our crisis response, and it is in the interest of the European Parliament, I would assume, that we incorporate as many elements from the Fiscal Treaty into the Community method as is legally possible. This is what we are doing with the two-pack.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now that the European Union institutions and Member States have embarked on a reflection process which will cover all aspects of a deeper EMU (including issues of solidarity), I am hopeful that we can agree that the two-pack goes ahead and not deal with other issues covered by the further deepening of the EMU.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as these other aspects of EMU-deepening are concerned, the summit was also an occasion for the Heads of State and Government to look in more depth at the issues on the basis of the interim report prepared by the President of the European Council, myself, and the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup. I would also like to underline the very useful contributions that the European Parliament and President Schulz have made to this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming to the next steps, I had already informed this House last month that we will deliver a blueprint for EMU in time before the December European Council. This blueprint will set out the Commission’s own thinking on all the building blocks of a deeper, genuine EMU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me a specific word about the issue of the fiscal capacity of an economic and monetary union. As I said in the State of the Union address before this House, to deliver lasting results, we need to develop a fully-equipped Community economic governance, together with a genuine, credible Community fiscal capacity. This would complement our efforts for a stronger and more binding framework for the implementation of key economic policies, in particular in the euro area, as one important means of preventing imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">While much has been done here, for instance through the Six-pack and the country-specific recommendations, further steps are crucial to combine specific conditions with specific incentives and to really make economic and monetary union sustainable. One interesting idea in this context is that of contractual arrangements between the Member States and the Commission. Such arrangements could underpin the commitments taken under the country-specific recommendations with specific support for their realisation. We must, however, be clear that this has nothing to do with the decisions on the next multiannual financial framework, which we will, hopefully, be able to take in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank this House for its important contributions and the cooperation with it on all these matters. It is very important to have the views and the involvement of the European Parliament at every stage in this process. We are designing a new system whereby more decisions will be taken at European level. We therefore need stronger accountability. Fixing accountability at the level where the decisions are taken will be one of the fundamental principles which will guide our discussions on economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we need to make sure that more democracy means more transparency and not more complexity. We already have a very complicated system of decision-making in Europe. A proliferation of institutions, mechanisms and procedures would make Europe more opaque and less readable and would distance us from our citizens precisely at a time when we need to draw closer together.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also a few more key principles for these reforms. First, we need to build on the existing institutional and legal framework based on the Community Treaties. We must support the deepening of integration in the euro area as the basis for strengthening our currency, the euro. We must ensure convergence between the existing and future euro area members. And we must respect the integrity of policies conducted at the level of the current 27 (very soon 28) Member States of the European Union, particularly the integrity of the Single Market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our tasks are mapped out. Let us not forget that, beyond the Growth Compact, the two-pack and banking supervision, we have other tasks and responsibilities this autumn. I am speaking in particular about the MFF. I expect those governments which are always talking about the need for investment to promote growth and jobs to contribute their support for the instrument for investment at European level. Once again this will be a critical test of our commitment to these policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the summit we also had an opportunity to send a very important message regarding Greece at the level of euro area Heads of State and Government. I welcome the conclusion of that meeting, when we said: ‘We expect Greece to continue budgetary and structural policy reforms and encourage its efforts to ensure swift implementation of the programme. This is necessary in order to bring about a more competitive private sector, private investment and an effective public sector. These conditions will allow Greece to achieve renewed growth and will ensure its future in the euro area’. It is very important that the Heads of State and Government have expressed this willingness and this commitment and their hope about keeping Greece in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Council discussed the external dimension of our actions, with a focus on our strategic partners, including China, and the need for a proactive agenda for trade. It is crucially important that Europe defend its interests in this globalising world. But openness is a vital element in facing the challenges of growth, and we must not miss out on the opportunities for further trade liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is significant that, at a time when many of our citizens have doubts about the ability of Europe to meet the challenges we face, the international community, through the Nobel Peace Prize, has sent us a clear message: the world needs a stronger European Union. It is indeed an honour to have this recognition for the project for integration and unity of this continent which has, over 60 years, brought us so much. But it is also a responsibility and a challenge for us to show the ‘courage de chaque jour’ – the everyday, mundane, courage – to do the right thing and take the decisions we need to take.</p>
      <p sl="en">By advancing the deepening of economic and monetary union and progressing towards a political union, let us make sure, together, that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 will not be awarded to an idea of the past but to a project of the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President Van Rompuy, I would like to start with the same issue that you began with, namely the European Central Bank and gender equality. First of all, I have a rather different view on the substance of Mr Mersch’s comments. I was extremely disappointed by them. However, I am even more disappointed by your position and your explanation here today. Mr Van Rompuy, it is simply not good enough!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We are not prepared to accept this kind of evasiveness. We have shown personal commitment because we believed that we could move forward, and we have built bridges. The President of this House built bridges, and yet all you have to say about gender equality is that, yes, we do not have enough of it! What we wanted was not a description of the situation but a commitment from you on how to move forward, and I am very sorry to say that we did not get it!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">As for the Council, I believe that the outcome was half-hearted. I would not go as far as to say that it was negative, but it lacked substance. As for the Compact for Growth and Jobs, we do not need 27 or 28 countries to meet in order to determine that, so far, it has had no effect. The Member States must play their part in ensuring that it is effective. Indeed, that is the critical task for the Member States. However, the problem is not only the Compact for Growth, of course. I think it is very regrettable that we have no opportunity to discuss in more detail today the reasons why the Commission and the majority on the Council still do not accept the World Bank’s findings, namely that their calculations are wrong and that the policies which we are pursuing are leading us into recession. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and, indeed, the Liberals are blocking any discussion of this issue. It is not about the Compact for Growth; it is about changing our policies for growth. We need policies at last which do not lead to recession but promote growth and employment. That is what I am demanding from the Commission and from the majority in the Council!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Do you not see that as unemployment rises, so does Euroscepticism and even outright rejection of Europe? That is the problem we have today. Chancellor Merkel and Mr Schäuble are throwing up a smoke screen, and there is a lot of talk about eurobudgets and a super-commissioner, but this is not going to solve the problems we face today. Even with the banking union, we can see how important it was that François Hollande said that we need the banking union now, or relatively soon. That is not just a question for France and Germany. It is a question of two fundamentally different concepts. The one says that institutional issues are important, so we will think about a convention which we want to appoint as soon as possible, perhaps as early as December, and we will think about a super- commissioner. However, as for thinking about the social problems which our policies are creating – no, they do not want to do that, nor do they want to think about the problems facing Spain and Ireland with the banks and their recapitalisation. Let me assure you that as Socialists and Democrats, our Group will not leave Spain or Ireland to fend for themselves. We will fight to make the banking union a reality soon – with sensible rules, of course – and to ensure that the ESM can finally progress with recapitalisation. Those are things that we agree with, Commission President. Indeed, that is why we are resisting these delaying tactics. In-depth consultation? Yes, by all means, but we need a solution soon, for we do not want any further deepening of the crisis in Spain and Ireland and other countries, with even more people losing their jobs. That cannot be our goal. For us, that is an intolerable situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I would like to mention the social question again. Mr Van Rompuy, we need this fifth sector, this fifth pillar, on social issues. That is an urgent necessity. We cannot have a situation in which social issues are simply mentioned in passing and dealt with in a few sentences. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said at the press conference that they can see the misery within society. Let me say it again, gentlemen: your job is not to describe what is happening. Your job is to change the situation and to work for a social Europe. That is what we need!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We are very proud of the Nobel Peace Prize. We are handing out badges because we are so proud of this achievement; that applies to us as a Group as well. However, we were not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for social peace within the EU. We do not deserve that yet. If we are awarded a Nobel Prize on that basis some day, I will be very satisfied with what we have achieved in Europe. However, we have not achieved it yet. On the contrary, many of the measures being agreed today move us in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final comment concerns Mr Cameron. We should make one thing very clear to Mr Cameron, who wishes to veto the budget. Mr Cameron, the fact is that we have a stronger veto: if you veto the budget, there will still be another one, namely the budget for 2013 and 2012! I would be very happy if Mr Cameron were to pursue that course of action, if he showed that he is not interested in Europe, and if he issued an even stronger rebuff to countries such as Poland and so on. We have more leverage than he does. If Mr Cameron does not want to give us his support, we will simply take the 2012 budget as the basis for the future budgets. That is the message that Mr Callaghan should be taking back to Mr Cameron!</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final comment on this subject: it is not acceptable for Mr Cameron to steadily withdraw from Europe while still wanting to have a say on every issue. Mr Cameron and the Conservatives, but also the Liberals in the United Kingdom need to make a decision. If you want nothing to do with Europe, then act accordingly, but do not try to have a say on every issue or contribute to decision-making on what happens in the Europe that you reject. Decisions on Europe should be taken by those who are committed to Europe. In my view, that is a fundamental principle which Mr Cameron needs to understand.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me first welcome the decision of the European Council on the banking union. Nevertheless, I have to tell you that I thought it had already been decided in June – but better a European Council that decides the same thing twice than nothing at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also glad to see that the Council finally agrees with the position of the European Parliament and that of the European Commission. We said from the beginning that this system has to be applicable to all banks, and it was an absurd idea to supervise only some banks.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second remark is also what our colleague Mr Swoboda said on the timetable. I have to tell you that I am less positive, because this timetable that they agreed on is firmly linked to – what? To the electoral calendar of Germany. I find it irresponsible that we first of all have to wait nine months before we can start to implement something that we will approve here through legislation by the end of the year. Nine months to wait for what? For the electoral calendar and the outcome of the elections in Germany. This is the intergovernmental method; if every time you have to wait for the electoral calendar of France, then Italy and now Germany, you will do nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the Paper. I think there are many good ideas in the Paper, and there are also ideas with which I have some difficulties: the idea of individual contracts, for example. I do not think that our European Union is what I would call a private law concern, based on contracts between the Member States and the European institutions. No: we want common policies and binding legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point on the paper is on mutualisation of debt. May I ask you, Mr Barroso – you know, I will do it every time – every month I will come back to you and ask you: where is your proposal on the redemption fund and on the start of a Eurobond market? Because you know that it is the only way that interest rates can go down in the European Union. Take, for example, Slovenia. Slovenia is a country with less than 60 % public debt; at the same time it has a fiscal deficit of more or less 3 %, and it has an interest rate of 6 %, because it is a small market and nobody is interested today, with this crisis, in buying Slovenian bonds. The Eurobond market is the only way to solve it. I can tell you I have talked about the necessity to approve the two-pack, while Parliament’s position is clear: if there is no proposal on the redemption fund on the table, we will not approve the two-pack. It is the same for Mr Schäuble’s proposal. Mr Schäuble can say, ‘I want the Super-Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs’. We will not go in that direction – even if I am in favour of that proposal – if there is no proposal on neutralisation of the debt as a first step towards the redemption fund or a first step towards a Eurobond market. We are firm on this within Parliament because we know that it is the only way to end this crisis, besides all the other measures which need to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, something completely different, Mr President: Syria. It is time for the European Council to do something, for the Nobel Peace Prize winner to do something. We all know what is needed in Syria. We need, as fast as possible, a no-fly-zone so that Assad can no longer do what he is doing now: using his air force to massacre his people. Aleppo, dear colleagues, is becoming more and more like Dresden. Daily bombardments, shelling by the Syrian air force and a whole city in ruins. I find it a scandal that neither the European Council nor the other European institutions are taking their responsibility regarding that scandal together with the international community.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, let me comment on the issue of women in the European Union and congratulate Ms Reding. I think she has hit exactly the right note with her proposal for quotas. I would also like to send a message to all her female colleagues and the other female Commissioners. I believe that every woman who has achieved power and influence in today’s European Union should be aware that on the one hand, this is of course due to skills and qualifications; on the other, however, it is also due to the fact that other women have campaigned for instruments such as the quota. This awareness should guide all those who are tasked with decision-making or who are in leadership roles, such as Ms Reding’s female colleagues at the Commission. Mr Barroso, I urge you not to undermine a positive initiative that enables the Commission to stand out as a beacon. On the contrary, I urge you to give Ms Reding your support.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards Mr Mersch, it is a great shame that Mr Mersch, of all people, appears to be undermining Ms Reding’s strategy. Indeed, let me make it clear to Mr Van Rompuy that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not support this under any circumstances. Perhaps it is enough for you to know that women have a future at the European Central Bank from 2018 onwards. However, this knowledge and prospect are not enough for us! We want a woman at the centre of power in the European Central Bank today, and we are not going to be fobbed off by you.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, the Nobel Peace Prize has been mentioned in passing in today’s debate. I was starting to think I was mistaken. When I first heard about this decision, taken in Europe’s northern-most region, I was deeply and genuinely moved. As a European politician, I almost took it personally. I felt that this came close to being an unexpected declaration of love for this great shared European project. Of course, it also meant that I looked forward to the summit with very different expectations, Teflon-coated, perhaps. So what happened? Where was the moment of reflection? What happened to the Nobel Committee’s appeal for reflection and for ‘thinking big’ in the European Union? From my perspective, that is the crucial aspect of the award: it makes us think about what we have achieved by working together, and what we may achieve in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Van Rompuy, it has been agreed once again that we should give ourselves more time to deal with the banking union. We can afford to do so because the European Central Bank has bought itself some time under Mr Draghi, as it did before under Mr Trichet. Once again, we have seen the crisis pass from an acute to a chronic phase. However, you should not take too long, nor should you be under any illusions, as you were once again with your speech today. In my view, at the end of December, we not only need to have the clear contours or a legal framework for supervision in the banking union. We also need to have the other two pillars in place, the two pillars which are never mentioned in the front row, namely deposit protection and the possibility of bank resolution in the European Union, which must take place in a process which is not only subject to democratic controls but also inspires confidence. In other words, there is a lot to do before the end of December.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me take up a point made by Mr Swoboda. Mr Van Rompuy, you said earlier that things are improving. You obviously consult a different set of statistics from mine. Perhaps we should swap. I have figures from the IMF and the World Bank which clearly show, once again, that single-minded and aggressive austerity policies do not improve matters. They do not even support the recovery of public budgets. In our crisis countries, we have higher deficits, and we also have an ailing economy, not only in the crisis countries but Europe-wide. We also have higher unemployment, especially among young people. Knowing this, I then came across a further publication from the IMF which says that fiscal consolidation can only be successful in the context of economic recovery. This requires very serious consideration, and highlights all of the shortcomings in the present policies to overcome the crisis. Economic recovery can only take place on the basis of better growth policies. I am interested to see what will happen now. I regard the comments made by Mr Tajani and Mr Oettinger almost as a threat. As for Europe 2020 – which, incidentally, they appear to have written off entirely – let me say that I cannot imagine being able to achieve sustainable economic recovery with industrial policy strategies of the kind proposed by Messieurs Oettinger and Tajani.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, was it President Hollande or Chancellor Merkel? After the summit, everyone was asking who had won. If we needed any further proof that the two of them did not merit the Nobel Peace Prize and did not match up to the Nobel Committee’s expectations, it can been seen in this particular issue. Political union and deeper European integration have to be dragged out of them. Chancellor Merkel should go to the German public long before the election and explain why financial solidity on its own makes matters worse. President Hollande, for his part, should explain to the people of France why even France has to transfer sovereignty to Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there were some good things to come out of last week’s Council meeting. For instance, there was the support for the single market of 27 Member States, developing more open trade, the cutting of some red tape and the withdrawal of some pending Commission proposals. These were all good things. However, we need to see more action on all of those initiatives and my group will certainly support Mr Barroso in taking these initiatives forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, when it comes to the main topic of debate – yet again the euro crisis – we can see that the summit manifestly failed to deliver. Both Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso spoke in this Chamber after the previous summit in June. They spoke about balancing solidarity with responsibility and described the results back then as ‘significant’. They said that these took Europe a few more steps down the road to recovery. Well, of course, over the summer it became clear that some key Member States had had second thoughts about what they agreed then, and the few small steps forward were overwhelmed by some pretty giant leaps backwards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only significance of that summit, with hindsight, was that it represented yet another missed opportunity. The window created by the actions of the ECB to enable political leaders to get ahead of the curve in reassuring the markets was lost then, and it is lost now. No amount of fudging over the timetable for the supervisory mechanisms or the carefully chosen words about mutual support can cover up for the fact that this summit simply backtracked on what had been agreed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a lot of sympathy for both Mediterranean Europe and Northern Europe, but we cannot go on with this stalemate, with one side unwilling to hand over budgetary sovereignty and the other side unwilling to hand over its chequebook and its cash. It seems to me that, as Mr Verhofstadt observed, we now have no chance of making any headway towards a solution to the crisis before the elections in Germany. The problem that we face is quite simply one of leadership. To take a topical example that has been mentioned in this debate, when the EU was awarded this famous Nobel Prize, the bickering began immediately about who was going to collect the prize, who was going to make the speech and who was going to talk at the dinner. I started thinking about all of those political leaders and organisations who actually really deserved to collect that prize for delivering peace in Europe, for holding firm during the Cold War and for challenging the might of the Soviet Union. I thought about the contributions of General de Gaulle, President Reagan, Prime Ministers Kohl and Thatcher, NATO, and Pope Jean Paul II. No doubt everyone in this Chamber has some figure that they want to put forward as contributing to that list. It seems to me that they had one thing in common – they had political courage, the courage to stand firm, to take political risks and to make sacrifices for what they believed in.</p>
      <p sl="en">What a sad contrast to the modern day Europe of today, where difficult decisions are delayed, timetables slip, and political realities are ignored. It was sobering to note that that Nobel Prize was awarded to the EU, not because we are dealing effectively with the current crisis, but because we are failing to do so. It is not a message of congratulations to Europe’s leaders, it is an act of charity. The prize has not been given to the EU because it is strong and doing well. It has been given now because the EU is weak and doing badly. That was made clear in the citation itself – in the announcement – if you read it.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let us put aside the self-congratulations and let us forget the mutual backstabbing. Let us get on instead with the difficult task of making the urgent decisions that are required to make the European economy competitive and to launch the project again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Rebecca Harms and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the decision taken yesterday evening that a recommendation be made not to elect Mr Mersch this week. I think this is the right decision. I also see it as sending out a signal which, hopefully, when the time comes, will secure majority support in this House, because it really does send out completely the wrong message to tell us that Europe should continue to be run solely by men, and to say that everything arising in the various policy areas dealt with by the European Union, whatever is necessary to safeguard social and indeed regional cohesion, can only be dealt with by male representatives. I think this is the wrong form of representation, at least in the majority of cases, although I admit that there are exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The results of the most recent summit are relatively limited. A previous speaker said that at the end, two victors appeared in front of the microphones and cameras and went through the usual ritual of saying that there were no losers. There are losers, however. Ordinary people are the losers. People within the European Union have lost out because once again, we are playing for time, because no one has given any thought to the fact that European policy needs to be corrected as a matter of urgency!</p>
      <p sl="de">I will come back to the example of the Compact for Growth and Jobs in a moment. You surely cannot seriously be proposing in your recommendations or in the Council’s decisions that, ultimately, the Structural Funds must be reprogrammed to fund the Compact for Jobs and Growth. This would mean that 25 % of the ESF would be under threat. With that proposal, you are also putting a question mark over the future of the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion. In the fight against poverty, we are talking about the fate of 120 million in Europe. Then you say that the Nobel Peace Prize for Europe is well-deserved. It simply does not add up!</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, which signals should the summit have sent out? Firstly, there should have been a recognition that austerity policies do not automatically lead to more growth. If the International Monetary Fund can do it, it should be child’s play for the European Union to admit that these policies have plunged hundreds of thousands more people into poverty and social exclusion. We do not need an undemocratic fiscal pact which erodes the rights of the national parliaments and especially the European Parliament. We need a solidarity pact, one which is designed for 99 % of the people of Europe, to replace the austerity pact from 1 % of the people. We need sustainable growth which can only be achieved with decent work, equitable redistribution and appropriate contributions from those who caused the crisis in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take a look at Greece again: the next tranche will amount to EUR 600 million and is supposed to be spent entirely on repaying the national debt. That means that almost EUR 30 billion have now been earmarked solely for the banks. Portugal was in a similar situation: of the EUR 78 billion allocated, only EUR 8 billion were actually earmarked for the public budget. What you are talking about, and what is being practised here, is certainly not the right balance. That needs to change, and that is what we are demanding. The timetable – the roadmap – for the banking union is really only a brief moment. Why will you not admit that this is simply about splitting up the national banks? You do not mention the ECB’s mandate and role as a lender of last resort or the ancillary roles which could be played by the European investment banks in this context. You need to change your approach. You need to change course – and then perhaps we can talk about the Nobel Peace Prize being well-deserved!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President: Mr Van Rompuy, when you first appeared here, in what proved to be a rather expensive speech I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy – and sure enough, in your dull and technocratic way, you have gone about your course. But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown … But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters.</p>

David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the bottom-up approach, step by step, during a period of four years, the jigsaw puzzle for fencing the monetary union with an economic, budgetary, fiscal and now banking union is gradually being completed. But the decisions are hesitant and sometimes ambiguous, the implementation very slow, while the markets are reacting with a speed we cannot match.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main necessity for the banking union is the moral hazard which exists in asking taxpayers to shoulder the recapitalisation of private banks, and even their rescue. The idea is for banks to borrow directly from the EMS, under conditions to be established in the coming months and through a supervision mechanism at European Central Bank level, and thus to decouple the burden of Member States’ sovereign debt for the sake of banks. If a number of banks now need direct support, this is due to the necessity of capitalisation at the new levels required and to the non-serviced loans as a consequence of the economic crisis. That is why this new mechanism should apply retroactively, covering banks that are now in this difficult situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the October Council decided on a timetable for the implementation of June’s decisions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate.</p>

What I mean by that is that, contrary to popular belief, I do not believe that the European crisis is behind us. Thus, we do not want proposals for tomorrow or the day after, we want actions for today, and I will give you a few examples.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first relates to the banking union. We are all in favour of it. The key is to make it effective and make it operational now, not in a year’s time, in order to allow recapitalisation of the banks; otherwise, of course, public debt will increase, and that would not be very smart.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, alongside the banking union, we need a solidarity mechanism, the creation of a European bond market. Once again, we need to do it now, before the countries in difficulty are completely ruined and, indeed, need more support from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, as regards the budget and the economic and investment policy, we need to implement the necessary public policies now; otherwise, there will be a recession tomorrow. It is better to do this before there is a recession than when in the midst of one, because then it will be too late.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, as regards gender equality in the European Union institutions and the ECB in particular, Mr Van Rompuy, we need to act now, not in 2018. Otherwise, what kind of credibility will we have if we are defending women’s rights outside the European Union yet having to teach a lesson to the governments of certain countries that do not respect those rights themselves?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as regards the political union, democracy and democratic legitimacy, which accompanies them, we need to put these issues on the table now and make progress on them now; otherwise, we will lose the confidence of the European people once and for all.</p>

Call upon your Vice-President to apologise to this House, to apologise to the Catalan people and to resign. He does not reflect the dignity of his position and he is not worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. I would say to Mr Vidal-Quadras ‘verguenza – shame on you’!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it was announced in advance of the summit that no decisions would be taken; it was simply about setting the policy course. In my view, this policy course is merely a continuation of the wrong approach, the centralist approach, pursued to date, which has led the eurozone into a dead end. Instead of giving the bankrupt countries the opportunity to leave the eurozone if necessary, the discussions focused on a fiscal union, with Brussels in control of the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">More robust supervision of systemically important banks is undoubtedly to be welcomed. After all, uncontrolled speculation has created a situation in which bank after bank has had to be shored up with taxpayers’ money. Nonetheless, banking supervision, no matter how effective, cannot contribute substantially to ending the euro crisis; for that, what is needed is a comprehensive reform of monetary union. However, instead of applying the brakes at last, the eurozone is apparently to be further centralised, with talk of a single budget for the eurozone and, indeed, Eurobonds, which would amount to nothing less than the irreversible ‘communitisation’ of debt.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a single currency requires genuine economic union; not merely a system of rules and regulations but economic government based on democratic institutions and equipped with adequate resources. Parliament insists that there can be no effective and legitimate ways of achieving this aim unless developed within the Union framework based on the institutions of the Union, and that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro because the euro is the currency of the Union. It is right that these principles should be recalled in the European Council’s conclusions, but they need to be stated tangibly and coherently.</p>
      <p sl="it">Greater fiscal capacity is required to absorb the shocks caused by the crisis and to sustain growth and social inclusion, but clearly such fiscal capacity can and must be made a part of the EU budget and must be based on additional own resources; above all it should not distract from the need to have a joint capacity for issuing and managing debt.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we are opposed to individual contracts: they are ineffective and risk bringing about an asymmetric transfer of sovereignty, which would accentuate the democratic deficit. Parliament proposes a different model: binding and general social and economic objectives defined in ordinary legislative procedure at EU level, with national governments and parliaments competent to decide how these might be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="it">This approach reflects a vision that is at once more ambitious and more realistic of a Europe in which stability, growth, social cohesion and democracy go hand in hand – and for this reason a fifth social pillar is essential – and of a federal transition aimed at building consensus among citizens on the basis of a clear road map. This would involve: 1) correcting a policy based on austerity and the inter-governmental method with swift Decisions that take maximum advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties and prioritise growth and employment; 2) rendering the upcoming European elections genuine elections for the government of the EU. Finally, a convention should be called to complete the building of real democratic government for Europe and its currency. Parliament calls on you to act, and Parliament will exercise all of its powers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, how many really understand the implications of the single supervisor? It looks to me like banking union ‘lite’ – getting the taste without the commitment. But, like monetary union, the ‘lite’ version will tie Member States together with de facto mutualisation in the event of systemic failures. Of course, we hope that stays theoretical, but citizens should know. Meanwhile, to avoid mutualisation, the ESM is out and recapitalising Spain’s current bank debt is out. Bond buying is linked to other conditionality. So what is the hurry? Is it a question of pushing through a good news story before the citizens get to understand it or before Parliament finds a better way, leaving the substance to never never?</p>
      <p sl="en">We are working to this mad timetable, but I see this as ‘legislate in haste and repent at leisure’ when a few months more could actually deliver the real deal. For all the gung-ho about banking union, I see no sign of it in CRD IV, which is still an exemption fest. Is it the intention for the ECB to stop all that? I think we should know and we should know up front.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on women in the ECB, we need more than talk that falls short of promises. That is no different from all the promises on gender equality that have so universally failed.</p>

      <p sl="nl">You can hold all the meetings you want but as long as you stick your heads in the sand about the fundamental problems of the European Union, the situation will go from bad to worse. A common currency for a continent with so much diversity is doomed to fail. We should cherish this diversity and not ruin ourselves with even more centralisation and control from Brussels. The euro is not worth that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I want to make a point of procedure to the members of the Conference of Presidents under your authority, Mr President. I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you said, President-in-Office of the Council, we need to restore confidence. We need to use politics to restore the confidence of the people.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it would be unfair to deny that this Council has resulted in some progress, but it is also correct to say that it has not been immense and has been slow to materialise, meaning that, although we are moving forward, if we fail to do so at an adequate pace, we will fall further behind on the objectives we are pursuing.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my opinion, it has not been an especially successful summit, and this is because of the following: the repetition that sees some decisions taken and then taken again, the slowness with which some measures are put into practice and their vagueness once they are, and, finally, the failure to achieve a balance between strict austerity and real social content.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the reiteration of agreements, it must be said that, now that we are approaching almost 30 summits, it is hard to tell one from the next; we remember the summit of May 2010, because it was the ‘Austerity Summit’, and that of June 2012, because it was the ‘Growth Summit’, but while austerity has certainly materialised, we have yet to see growth to the same extent.</p>
      <p sl="es">In terms of the slowness and vagueness of the measures adopted, the European Council conclusions usually state that it is essential that the measures agreed are implemented swiftly, but, looking at the conclusions of the recent summit, it is phrases such as ‘in the coming weeks’ and ‘work is under away’ that predominate, while the only thing that really is under way since the ‘Growth Summit’ is the EUR 100 million for a political programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the lack of balance, the fact is that the Council’s work does not include a significant amount of social content or social dialogue, and there is a danger, for instance, that it will fall to the Member States to find solutions for the problems arising from poverty. We need a European response to help Europe’s poor. It is the only way to lend the European Union legitimacy.</p>

      <p sl="es">By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed.</p>
      <p sl="es">We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented. The euro’s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with or without a summit, Europe is still in recession. There is a lack of growth stimulus and a shortage of jobs. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, you will have to launch some fresh initiatives before your term in office comes to end, otherwise there will be no end to this crisis in Europe. A summit, no matter how intensive the debate, cannot change anything. Europe’s young people have no jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, you have instruments at your disposal. Mr Andor and the Commission could utilise the available instruments. Why are we not making cuts within the framework that we already have, within the framework of the commitments made in the European Semester, tying the Member States into this process and starting straight away? Why are we not focusing on the young unemployed based on a specific annual percentage proposed by the Commission? Why can we do all kinds of things on a binding basis but we apparently cannot combat youth unemployment this way? The European Parliament is waiting for you to take the initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need more economic policy competences at the European level, that is absolutely right. The basic question is this: who is doing the regulating here, and what are they regulating? Every time the German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, comes and talks to us, he says that he would like to have a strong Finance Commissioner. We say, fine, let us give the job to Mr Rehn. That is the Mr Rehn who is possibly listening now to what this House has to say. Mr Rehn, it would be wonderful if you were given more competencies. However, let us make a deal, and let us be quite clear about it: you would then negotiate your mandate with the European Parliament. Life would be very different then. You would not have to ring round all of the European capitals to find out what they wanted at that particular moment. You would not have to negotiate any bilateral agreements with people who have no idea what it is all about. No, you hammer out your mandate with this House. Europe has all the means at its disposal and all the techniques it needs. We should be strengthening the European Union in its present form. We do not need another Europe. We do not need any new institutions. We need to strengthen the existing institutions, and that means strengthening the European Parliament. That is the only way to move out of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, facts are extraordinarily stubborn things. The most recent Eurostat statement shows unambiguously that our crisis management is inadequate. In spite of this, decision-making at the current summit continues to be erratic. No decisions have been arrived at, only a direction. At the same time, I think it is important that the new banking supervision should be able to start operating on the basis of the current EU institutions and treaties, and that in future a clear separation will be made between the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and its supervisory responsibilities. We have wasted a great deal of time, but this is not a good reason to make irresponsible decisions now on the pretext that time is short, and which could result in flawed supervision.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am referring to the sort of decisions that will be detrimental to non-members of the eurozone, or indeed to those who voluntarily sign up to the new supervisory mechanism. It is a well-known fact – we have stated this several times and we will not deny it – that the crisis does not respect borders. This is why it is clear to me that we must also have cross-border crisis management – while of course taking into account the interests of the Member States. In other words, saving the euro requires maximum integration. For those of us who have stated that we want to join the euro in future, it is unacceptable to hear talk of a multi-tiered Europe in connection with banking supervision. Those who say this are flying in the face of the fundamental principle of European solidarity. They have not read the signs of the times and they are refusing to learn from the bitter lessons of the past.</p>

      <p sl="el">The citizens of my country, and other countries too, who are experiencing the harsh reality of budgetary adjustment, should soon come out of this situation. As regards the single supervisory mechanism, this is indeed an element in the deepening of monetary union, and its creation must be expedited. All too often, the banks are part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, comments have been heard here about whether or not there is equality between the sexes. We must move on from talk to action.

      <p sl="nl">A great many measures have been taken in the past few years to address the multi-faceted crisis: standard measures and non-standard measures; measures within the Treaty and measures outside the Treaty. Despite this, confidence has not been restored and it is confidence, above all, that is necessary to recreate a financial and economic climate that is conducive to economic growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, complex structural problems require structural solutions, in the Member States, but also in the Union. That is why we are anxiously looking forward to the final road map to a strong economic and monetary union that you, Mr Van Rompuy, have been working to complete with the Presidents of the other institutions, and that you plan to use to eliminate the flaws in the economic and monetary union. It has to be an ambitious plan, a plan that is implemented without delay, because the crisis will not wait for politics. That is also the reason why we in Parliament are not sitting around doing nothing.</p>

This has apparently not been accepted. However, we heard statements yesterday from the highest German and French authorities that Ireland would be treated as a special situation.

From the outset, we agreed, firstly, that in all of the Member States, we must make more sparing use of our financial resources; secondly, we agreed that we urgently need structural reforms; and thirdly, we agreed that we need to stimulate growth. We have done all this. The truth is that things are moving forward. This is happening slowly, but we are making progress. Sometimes, I do not understand why there are these agitated speeches, as if we were constantly expected to reinvent the world. We are on the right track. Mr Van Rompuy, I am most grateful to you for being such a staunch advocate of an approach which relies on steady and systematic work. It is not about introducing something new every week. It is not about producing a new instrument or investing hopes in some other marvellous innovation week after week. What we need is a systematic approach. That is the only way to move forward. Indeed, progress is being achieved, slowly but surely. Thoroughness and reliability are better than speed and a hectic approach. That is why implementation and systematic controls are more effective than a constant stream of new ideas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very happy with the way we are working now. In fact, let me say this on the topic of banking supervision: it does not matter which day we introduce this system of banking supervision, as the two Presidents have said. What matters is whether it works. We ourselves adopted all manner of decisions in connection with the European Banking Authority and we wanted more. Today, we are doing things differently, more systematically. What matters is whether and how the new structures work, not when they work. So I would like to thank you for this systematic and somewhat calmer and more dependable approach. I think it is the right one. What ultimately counts is not who talks a better game but whose actions speak louder than words.</p>

Consistency in enforcement is a principle which must apply at national and European level. You underlined this in the case of Greece, and rightly so, but to achieve consistency in enforcement, government commitments are not enough.

      <p sl="sl">The European Research Area must remain a priority that we should implement more rapidly in line with the Ljubljana Process. We must facilitate mobility for researchers, and in particular proper working conditions and comparable pay for the same work.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If we compare ourselves with the United States, we need to do more primarily in the area of designing a suitable environment for researchers and private investors.

Then it will be able to supervise the banks, provided the banking supervision and monetary supervision are functionally separated, and provided the separation does not mean that the banking supervision has to be brought under the political control of Parliament. The Stability and Growth Pact has shown that political supervision does not work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all regarding the assessment of this European Council, some of you have probably noted that in my initial statement I mentioned three European Council summits. I did that on purpose because this summit was important in terms of confirming some earlier decisions. That represents some progress already because the reality is that, unfortunately, doubts existed as to the commitment of some governments regarding decisions they had taken previously. In fact, though, the final decisions on some of those most important matters will come later, namely regarding the EMU in December and regarding the MFF, hopefully, in November.</p>
      <p sl="en">So my assessment of this European Council is that it was certainly a step forward in terms of previous decisions being confirmed, but it was not yet the comprehensive response needed for the current challenges in the euro area and in the European Union. I consider this a fair assessment of the results of this European Council. Of course we have to know that we are working on extremely sensitive matters where, to be frank, the initial positions of our Member States are very diverse and where the interest, I believe, of all the European institutions is to create the right conditions for consensus and operational decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One point where there was some progress was on the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and I am also glad that this debate today has shown a broad degree of consensus on the principles set out in the Commission proposals and reflected in the European Council conclusions. These include, most importantly, that the SSM should cover all banks, that there needs to be openness – as full as possible – and to have as full as possible participation by the non-euro Member States which so wish, and that the SSM is a key element in proving that the European Union is capable of moving forward, of restoring confidence, deepening the EMU and opening up the way to decisions on bank recapitalisation by the ESM.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly welcome the determination expressed by Parliament, namely by rapporteur Ms Thyssen, to advance the SSM work so that we can reach a quality result by the end of 2012. The Commission will work closely with you to further improve the SSM proposals and open the way for the operational phasing-in of the system in 2013 – as had in fact been proposed by the Commission – starting with systemic banks and eventually extending to all banks in the euro area and participating non-euro area Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important issue that was mentioned here – I think it was a question by Mr Mauro – was the sense of urgency. I want to tell you that I made that urgency clear. The reality once again, if you want to be honest in our assessment, is that not all Member States feel the same degree of urgency. This is probably due to the fact that they are in different financial and fiscal positions, but I believe that it is important for the credibility of our response that this response is properly prepared. Some of these issues are extremely difficult from a political and technical point of view but the decisions should be as urgent as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue that was raised concerned a social pact for Europe. How can we complement some of these decisions with proper consideration of the social dimension? The elements proposed in the social pact are, to a large extent, already reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy. That is, let us not forget, a strategy for inclusive growth, and in fact the macroeconomic imbalance procedure has been an integral part of the implementation of this strategy during the second European semester. This has implied a number of new challenges for all of us, notably in terms of ensuring that the labour market and social issues are adequately reflected and assessed within this new framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">This integration results from the fact that economic growth and employment and social aspects are two sides of the same coin. It was interesting to see in the debate that many people are speaking about having a real minister for finance in Europe. They should probably also be thinking about having a real minister for the economy in Europe, so that we complete the work on financial stability with a commitment to sustainable growth and also to the economic and social dimension. Employment and social cohesion are not just an outcome of economic growth but are also an important determinant. The Commission strongly believes that our values of social justice, solidarity and equal opportunities must remain at the heart of European integration and continue to be understood as prerequisites for our future economic prosperity, for the well-being of European citizens and for European cohesion. They must also appear in the European Union’s growth agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the beginning of 2013 the Commission will present a social investment for growth and cohesion package which will also address various aspects mentioned under what some of you have described as the social pact. The message I want to convey to you is that, yes, we are doing everything we can with the tools and instruments available at European level to inject this economic and social dimension into the broader response to the current crisis in the economic situation of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the future responses on mutualisation of debt, you know what our position is. The Commission has stated it and we will also address this issue in the blueprint I have mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">One point I want to make clear, and that I do not agree with, is the position of those who say that they are in favour of the content of the two-pack, they are in favour of more integration in supervision of budgetary policy, they are in favour of reinforcing the competence of the Commission and the European institutions, the Community method, in terms of economic governance, but they will not support this – they will not approve it – before decisions are taken on other issues like the redemption fund. This is a mistake. It is a mistake because if you make progress on one very important issue in the European Union dependent on other issues, where you know very well that there is not yet agreement between all our Member States, you are in fact paralysing progress and economic governance in the euro area. That is a choice for you to make, but my strong advice to all the pro-European forces is to support everything that enables us to put as much as possible under the Community method and in the European institutions and this is certainly the case with the Two-pack proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now another issue which was mentioned was the situation regarding some statements made by the IMF. I want to be clear on this aspect as well. The reason we have this crisis today, contrary to what some Eurosceptics suggest, is not because of the euro area. We have a crisis today in the European Union economy because of excessive debt created by national governments and because of the irresponsible financial behaviour in some sectors, including outside of Europe. So Europe was not the cause of the problem, Europe is indeed the victim of the problem and is now trying to be part of the solution. This is the reality.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">It was irresponsible behaviour in terms of the excessive debt of public authorities and the sometimes completely irresponsible behaviour of some actors in the financial sector which created the problem. The proof of this – that this is not the problem of the euro – is that, for instance Mr Farage, your own country, which is not a member of the euro, is now implementing a very difficult austerity package. The British people are suffering the consequences of past mistakes. It was not the euro that created the Britain’s problems.</p>
      <a text="(Loud applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">So it is intellectually – I repeat – it is politically and intellectually dishonest to pretend that the euro is the cause of our problems. In fact, it is the European Union that is part of the solution because, without the support of other countries in the euro area, some of our Member States would not have the financing necessary to keep their states running, to keep their social services, to keep their national health systems, to keep their public education. This is the reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">So Europe is part of the solution and now we have to do everything we can to stabilise the euro area and to create the conditions for growth. But what growth? Sustainable growth! Not the growth of the past. The growth fuelled by excessive debt is not sustainable. The growth fuelled by irresponsible private credit is not sustainable, as we have seen.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to return to conditions for growth that is sustainable. This why the IMF, like the Commission, like the ECB, is in favour of fiscal consolidation. What the IMF said, and we can completely agree with this, is that the situation is different in some Member States and so those countries which have the margin to promote growth in terms of internal demand can do so, and in some cases there can be fine tuning of the objectives. Indeed I want to make it very clear that it was the Commission which proposed, and we were supported by the IMF, but it was the Commission which proposed one more year for Portugal and Spain to reach the budget consolidation targets. It was our proposal, not the IMF’s proposal. So, first for Spain and then for Portugal, the Commission recommended to the Council that the deadline for correction of excessive deficit be extended by one year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our fiscal rules, the revised Stability and Growth Pact, allow for this: when the economic situation turns out to be worse than expected and the reduction of the deficit in structural terms is taking place, an extension of the period to correct a nominal deficit can be granted. This is not automatic. The situation will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was also the position of Madam Lagarde when she said ‘conseil nécessaire et possible’ which means in English: advice ‘when it is needed and possible’, and this is exactly the position taken by the institutions that are monitoring the situation in some of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, in the case of countries under financial assistance, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal, one must assess the consequences on that sustainability of a possible prolongation of an adjustment period. Prolonging the adjustment period can delay reversing the increase in the government’s debt ratio and put it on a declining trend. This in turn will delay the return of those countries to the market, possibly requiring extra financing, and then comes the question: are the other euro area countries – because decisions are taken by the governments – the Commission makes the proposal in the end but I want to make it clear that the decisions are taken ultimately by governments – are the euro area countries ready to provide extra financing? This is an important issue. This means that for programme countries the possible prolongation of the programmes is subject to the severe constraints stemming from high levels of debt. These are also in fact the views of the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, one thing it is important to note and which people have not paid sufficient attention to, is that some of those who are now saying that we should be more, let us say, flexible in terms of the fiscal targets, are exactly the same people as are proposing hard restructuring of debt; are exactly the same people as believe that the euro area is too big, that southern Europe should not in fact be in the euro area, that it was a mistake to have those countries in the euro area. This is exactly the point I want to make: we do not agree. We believe we should do everything we can to keep the integrity of the euro area because when you accept more flexibility in terms of fiscal adjustment you have to think what the consequences in terms of deficit stability will be and how we can keep those countries going to the market as soon as possible so that they can finance their own state. It is very important to understand this.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why in fact I wanted to respond to those direct questions from you, to say that a lot remains to be done, but I believe that this European Council was an important moment for discussing the difficulties in a relatively open manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not underestimating in any way the difficulties and challenges ahead. I think we are now coming to a moment where, probably because there is less pressure coming from the markets, the sense of urgency in all of our capitals is not the same. That is why I expect Parliament and the Commission, as European institutions that keep firmly to the agenda, to understand that, without a complete comprehensive response to the euro area governance, we will not have the necessary conditions of confidence and confidence is critically important to restore investment and growth and jobs. This is our final and ultimate goal. Growth and jobs, but I repeat, sustainable growth for sustainable jobs.</p>

    <intervention id="2-128-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Herman Van Rompuy" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have said: ‘you need to act, you need to act now’. I have given you an overview of everything that we have done over the last two or three years, with which you are very familiar, and some of you have even said: ‘you have done a lot; now you need to act and implement your decisions’. We thus do not need to create new instruments, as some of you reiterated, before the instruments we already have are implemented. At the same time, we are told: ‘you need to act now’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we have done – and I often say this – was inconceivable a year or two years ago. In fact, when it comes to the economic and monetary union, I must say – and you will also have seen this in Mrs Thyssen’s excellent report – that we have already made a great deal of progress on the economic union, on the budgetary union and even on the banking union. We have to intensify our efforts, but we have already made a good start.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we have underestimated, however – and I think we must all take the blame, both in the Member States and in the institutions – is the breadth, the depth and the seriousness of the crisis in some of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The loss of competitiveness and damage to the sustainability of the debt have been so severe that we need much more time to change course. We cannot think for a second that with a deficit of 15 %, as in one country, or a debt of 160 % we can escape the austerity policy. We cannot think that with deficits of 10 % to 15 % on the current accounts of other countries, we can escape a corrective policy, an amending policy, an austerity policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not imposed, first and foremost, by the European institutions, it is imposed by the reality of the situation; it is the consequence of maladministration in quite a few countries over a period of time. We did not act soon enough, neither in the Member States, nor collectively at European Union level. Therefore, the so-called austerity policy is not a policy imposed from above; it is a policy that was inevitable, completely inevitable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have underestimated the breadth and the seriousness of the crisis. We have done many things over the last two or three years, and that is underestimated, too. We have not finished yet. That is why the four Presidents of the institutions are currently working on more initiatives. One of the key points, and something that we lacked, was sufficient financial integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the start of the financial crisis, we set up three or four institutions, of course, but they focused mainly on coordination. Now we need institutions that are much more European, that are shared more fully by all. In fact, what we are going to do now, with the single supervisory mechanism, is in some ways an unprecedented breakthrough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, there is serious work to be done. We took that decision in June. The Commission put forward its proposal in September and the October European Council laid down the broad guidelines to enable the ministers to complete the work. You, too, have a responsibility in terms of the implementation of this banking union and we hope – and it is an extremely ambitious timetable – to continue and complete the work by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the legislative framework has been determined, there is all of the operational work by the Central Bank to put this single supervisor in place, and that will take a number of months, too. Step by step, but with serious and continuous efforts, we are endeavouring to ensure that this first pillar of the banking union is a truly European pillar. We are told that we need to act. We are acting, but we are acting in a serious fashion, in a fashion that guarantees a certain level of quality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If things are moving somewhat slowly, that is one of the reasons for it. We have done many things and we are in the process of doing things that, in relation to the past, are quite revolutionary, when we talk about certain new institutions that we are going to set up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Have we reached the end? No. That is why we are going to work with December in mind.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the work will be harder than we imagine, because now, after everything we have done – the six-pack, and let us hope that the two-pack will be implemented quickly, too – with the Treaty on Stability and the Stability and Growth Pact, with everything we have done on the financial assistance mechanisms, with everything we have done in all of these areas, now we are really getting to the core of sovereignty and the core of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The next stage will thus be a qualitative leap. It will also be a gradual process and I can assure you that the debate will not be straightforward here in this House, nor in the European Council, nor in other institutions. Indeed, the further we go, the harder it becomes to make further progress without touching on certain taboos relating to the concept of sovereignty and the concept of solidarity. I would warn you then that between October and December the work will be very difficult and we will have to take decisions that affect a number of taboos.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There has been talk of a fifth building block, but the social dimension must form an integral part of every single policy. That is what we did with the Europe 2020 strategy. Mr Barroso and I fought to ensure that this fifth goal of combating poverty was approved. It was not easy; most of the Member States were totally opposed to it. However, we eventually incorporated it in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, what is the Compact for Growth and Jobs but an element of the social dimension? What is more social than trying to create jobs in extremely difficult circumstances? The social dimension can be seen everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The four building blocks that I have proposed are building blocks that are traditional in every economic and monetary union. Moreover, in the European Council, no Head of State or Government, of any ilk or any political leaning, has called them into question. Therefore, we will also work on this social dimension, as I have just said, within the framework of these four building blocks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The social policy is most important at Member State level. When the Member States take decisions on fiscal consolidation – and I was a finance minister for a very long time – they have to evaluate every measure in terms of its social impact. What is needed is a policy where the strongest shoulders bear the heaviest load. That is a general rule; but when it comes to implementing it and making it a reality, it is much more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The social dimension is everywhere, both in the Member States and in the policies adopted at European level. Some people say: ‘we need to act now on growth’. Ladies and gentlemen, the monetary policy – and I do not want to pass judgment – is not a restrictive policy, when we see that the interest rates are, in practice, negative interest rates and that the Central Bank is providing liquidity to the tune of EUR 1 000 billion by the end of the year; EUR 1 000 billion! The monetary policy is by no means a restrictive policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the budgetary policy is concerned, are we once again going to move to deficit spending? No! Where possible, however, we are going to make the path a little easier. We have done it for Spain and for Portugal, and we may do it for other countries, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, if we do not continue with these fiscal consolidation efforts, the markets will, unfortunately, punish these countries immediately. Everything that is gained by making the path a little easier will be lost immediately because of interest rate increases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, we do not have not dozens of different ways to generate economic growth in the very short term. The most important thing in the short term is to restore confidence in the euro area. That is more important than anything else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you do not mind, I will give you some figures because when you say something positive, you need to be careful because it is not really politically correct. If you look at the difference between the bond rates 10 years ago in most of our countries and the benchmark, which is the German interest rate, if you look at the current situation and compare it to the worst situation in the last 12 months, you will see a decrease: 239 points in Italy, 249 points in Spain, 800 points in Portugal, 900 points in Ireland and 270 points in Belgium. It is therefore not right to say that there have been no results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that these results last, and the difficult lesson here is, of course, that we have been wrong on several occasions in the past. Well, perhaps I am the only one who has been wrong and some of you are always right. In any case, I can get things wrong. This result is also a clear sign that we can make progress in terms of restoring confidence. If we continue like this, consumers and businesses will also gain in confidence and that will lead to an increase in growth, albeit too low, at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, and, indeed, we are starting to see the first signs of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Restoring confidence in the future of the euro area is the best way of promoting economic growth in the very short term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This work will take place here and in the European Council, gradually, step by step. Each time, we are comparing completely new elements to the past. We will continue the work in December. In the meantime, I, like you, hope that in November we will reach an agreement on the multiannual framework. To do that, however, we need one thing, without which an agreement will be impossible: we need a sense of compromise and the political will for this to work. Without that, an agreement will not be possible. For our part, like the other Councils that I have chaired, we will make every effort to reach a compromise.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not wish to take up too much of your time. I simply wish to remind my fellow Members of an event of major European significance that began on 23 October 1956. I am referring, of course, to the revolution in Hungary. Unfortunately, it is sometimes misused by extremists, such as today’s demonstrations by Jobbik and by Nick Griffin, a homophobic extremist from the British National Party. This was a major and very important event in European history, along with the Berlin uprising and the Prague Spring, of course. We should not let this day pass without remembering all those who fought bravely in a revolution which, tragically, was crushed by Soviet troops. Even so, it was an important symbol of freedom in Europe. As the European Union is now a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, it is important to commemorate this day.</p>

The plans for greater unification of the euro area and the EU coexist with the tension of the growing centrifugal tendencies, and run up against the insurmountable conflicts among the bourgeois classes regarding the distribution and extent of the destruction of capital and the way out of the crisis, and the problems of management which these conflicts entail.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Most of the topics reviewed at the summit had also been discussed at the previous summit. What is new is that the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, is proposing a separate budget for the eurozone. I understand that there is a great need for more money to save the banks but is the emergency fund not the instrument for that? There is no public support for a bigger emergency fund, but is a new budget not a way to hoodwink our citizens? In Mr Van Rompuy’s proposal a separate budget for the eurozone comes down to ever more ‘Europeanisation’ of social policy. Calling for more Europe at a time of crisis threatens to trample subsidiarity under foot compared with economic, social and fiscal policy. Does the Council not recognise an area of tension here? How will he ensure that subsidiarity is not eroded? I want to warn you about these proposals for an economic and budget union, because I am very worried about them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is laudable that the European Union is maintaining its decision to stimulate economic growth and jobs within the context of the Europe 2020 strategy. The Compact for Growth and Jobs agreed in June, is the general framework for action at both national and EU level, using all the necessary tools and policies.,. Therefore, all the commitments made under the pact must be fulfilled as soon as possible. It is a fact that SMEs offer approximately 90 million jobs in the EU, of which 30 % are in micro-enterprises, while 85 % of the new jobs created between 2002 and 2012 were by SMEs, mainly new enterprises. Access to finance is essential for financing business investment, to guarantee that they reach their full development potential and so to facilitate the creation of new enterprises that can generate growth and future jobs. The Commission must provide even more support to Member States in reprogramming their structural funds so that they are strongly focused on economic growth and job creation, especially for young people, women and vulnerable individuals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At a time when we are still suffering the effects of the economic and financial crisis, it is understandable for the European Council to have focused on economic issues, particularly as regards the need to invest in growth and job creation and the need to extend economic and monetary union (EMU). It is essential that we rebuild European competitiveness and encourage investment and job creation, as the number of unemployed in the EU is around 25 million. We therefore need a growth-oriented budget. It is also vital to restore confidence in the euro area and ensure the EU’s long-term stability, by guaranteeing economic convergence. However, it is not only EMU that needs a boost, but also the Union of citizens. The creation of a common European identity, in an area without internal borders, is under threat. We have to urgently reach compromises in this area, too, as the Europe of which we want to be proud is not limited to the common market, but goes further, by prioritising people within European policies. I regret that, in all of these areas, the Council has simply repeated previous decisions and postponed others, which does not give hope to Europe’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The essential element for the single supervisory mechanism for banking to succeed is to ensure the equal participation of all Member States in the decision-making process. The dominant weight of euro area capital in EU Member States with national currencies requires a balanced configuration of the regulatory framework. Otherwise, not only will the European Union be transformed into a structure made up of 17 decision-makers and 10 victims, but also, the conditions for major systemic risks will be created.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agreement regarding the gradual implementation of the practice for banking control in the euro zone indicates a departure from counterproductive debates on banking and budgetary union in European priorities. The French-German compromise, indispensable for the Union’s cohesion, could be the right solution for reducing the very dangerous interdependence between banks and governments. To reduce the vicious circle of increasing interest rates, the lowering of ratings and liquidity problems, we need more than just measures; we also need a framework that will force the banking sector to become sustainable and responsible when faced with speculative tendencies. The serious effects of the economic crisis, which started in the financial sector, force us to act so that ‘banking ethics’ does not become a contradiction in terms.</p>

      <p sl="sk">On 18-19 October there was another meeting of the European Council. In connection with the ongoing administration of economic and monetary union, there is a need to decide on a proper legislative framework relating to a single supervisory mechanism as soon as possible, and by 1 January 2013 at the latest. The process aimed at deepening economic and monetary union must in particular be open and transparent to Member States that are not part of the eurozone and the integrity of the single market must be respected.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We need a real economic and monetary union. Smooth operation of the economic and monetary union requires more intensive and sustainable economic growth, employment and social cohesion. I agree that improvements should continue to be made in administration within the eurozone. We should adopt legislative proposals relating to budgetary supervision by the end of 2012 at the latest. This involves key legislation that is essential for strengthening the new economic governance in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Council also agreed that it is essential to break the vicious circle between banks and states. We need precise operating criteria directly governing the recapitalisation of banks from the European Stability Mechanism.

      <p sl="pt">This meeting marks an unmistakable deepening of the economic, social, political and institutional crisis in which the EU is mired. Fastidiously repeating general positions and announcements – on growth, employment, reforms, consolidation, single market and other clichés which regularly appear in the conclusions of European Council meetings – is not the way to tackle the growing tensions and contradictions, particularly those between Germany and France, Spain and Italy, among others. Faced with the mass destruction of productive forces, unprecedented levels of unemployment, and deep and prolonged recessions in prospect, growing differences of opinion over the extent (and location) of this destructive process are developing. The contradictions surrounding the banking supervision mechanism and direct financing of the European Stability Mechanism by the banks are a clear example of this. Against this backdrop, attacks are continuing on the rights and sovereignty of the people, and on democracy itself. Following on from economic governance and the Fiscal Compact/Budget Treaty, the idea is emerging of concluding contracts between the Member States and European institutions, forcing the former to comply with a previously agreed plan of reforms, in line with the recommendations of the European Semester. Despite differences of opinion, an agreement determined by class interests has prevailed, which aims to intensify the exploitation and robbery of workers and citizens.</p>

The stumbling of the world economy and the debt crisis strangling our Union have accelerated those harmful tendencies, due to which fewer and fewer people are able to maintain a proper standard of living and for more and more European citizens even everyday subsistence represents an insoluble challenge. The European Council will devote a special meeting in November to reaching agreement on the next multiannual financial framework, which will be a crucial factor in improving the hopeless situation of the poorest Europeans, the marginalised millions of our Union. The Commission and Parliament have introduced proposals to give priority to the integration of the most disadvantaged communities and I truly hope that the fourteen governments of our political group will promote these amendments unanimously in the Council, and enable regional policy to help the most deprived and most marginalised 30 million Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="bg">In recent weeks, many of us have been wondering whether the European leaders would take the specific steps required for the implementation of the lofty objectives that they set themselves at the start of the year. Swaying between gloating and sincere concern, almost everyone agreed on one thing: that there was an evident delay, an increasing lack of clarity and a feeling of a lack of political will. Today we can view matters with more optimism because a decisive step has been taken towards the introduction of a single banking supervisory mechanism. I am very pleased that its development was announced as a priority and that a deadline was fixed for reaching an agreement for its legislative framework, that is, 1 January 2013. There is no doubt now that the European banking union will be realised. Its new, stricter rules will give security to citizens and increase confidence in the markets. However, I must reiterate: the ease with which some leaders make references to the inevitability of splitting Europe into a ‘two-speed’ Europe is frightening. The European banking union and subsequent fiscal union will form the future not only of the eurozone countries but of the entire EU, and their success will depend on everybody, not just the countries that are directly involved in the euro crisis today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the last few years, the European institutions have come up with a series of proposals, documents and pacts. We talk about different unions: economic, monetary, banking and political. We establish new mechanisms, authorities and agencies. Summit follows summit. Some time ago, a strategy paper was adopted on Europe 2020. Meanwhile work has also been ongoing on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 and on reforms to the main policies. For the average EU citizen, the sheer number of initiatives and actions is often confusing. In my opinion, three objectives are the most important right now. First of all, reaching an agreement on the future financial framework in order to ensure the stability of the EU and financing for growth measures under the EU budget from 2014. Secondly, a single banking authority should be set up that will strengthen the banking system in Europe and help establish a banking union. Sound and effective banking will create the conditions for the much-desired growth. We must ultimately make sure that there is no repeat of a situation in which a crisis within financial institutions and the collapse of banks become the cause of a financial, and subsequently economic, crisis, with huge sums allocated from national budgets in order to rescue these institutions. Thirdly, more robust economic management and budgetary supervision and coordination in the Member States must go hand in hand with deeper structural reforms and greater productivity and competitiveness. These measures will help strengthen the EU politically, as an efficient structure bolstered by economic integration and essential reforms designed to tackle the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The countries belonging to the eurozone have committed to ensuring that a future dedicated eurozone budget would not be detrimental to the budget of the 27, but the grounds for having an independent eurozone budget have been recognised. As far as banks in countries outside the eurozone are concerned, the possibility of joining the banking union and applying community regulations is a given, but they will not be able to share in the resources of the planned bank rescue fund. Meanwhile, the countries of the eurozone will be able to offer financial support on a contractual basis to less competitive members for the purpose of structural reforms, while this possibility is not available to countries outside the eurozone. It is becoming increasingly clear that the rules of the common market are being shaped according to the demands of the eurozone, quite simply because the countries outside the eurozone are in the minority (EU17-EU10). Participation in deepening integration is vital to the interests of small, open economies such as Hungary that are stuck outside the eurozone. Being stuck on the outside will mean a steady decline in their ability to service national debt and attract vital capital into the country to ensure a functioning banking system, finance development and enhance competitiveness. It is high time that Mr Orbán’s Government abandoned its freedom-fighter economic policy, which runs directly counter to the European mainstream. It is a policy that will mean the ruin of the Hungarian economy and leave the country lagging behind in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The most recent European Council held in Brussels had the opportunity to discuss three issues regarded as pivotal to the future of the European Union, namely the Compact for Growth and Jobs, and economic and monetary union. In addition, reference was also made to the difficult economic and financial situation of Greece. I support the new Compact for Growth and Jobs being rapidly implemented to the tune of EUR 120 billion, the capital of the European Investment Bank being increased by EUR 10 billion, trans-European networks in the area of energy and transport being adopted, and the internal market being extended or the amounts for research and innovation or industrial competitiveness being increased. I am therefore critical of the lack of agreement between the Member States on the entry into force of economic and monetary union, with the decision having been made that the European Central Bank will not extend its responsibilities for supervising all European banks until next year. I would also stress that, if any Member State in receipt of external financial support manages to make the adjustment period more flexible, or if the bank recapitalisation amounts do not influence the budget deficit, all of the other countries should be entitled to receive exactly the same treatment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the conclusions of the European Council of 18-19 October in which it reinforced its commitment to take decisive action to deal with the tensions in the financial markets, to re-establish trust and stimulate economic growth and to create jobs. Not enough progress has been made in implementing economic growth and job creation as agreed in June and therefore we ask for firm, rapid and result-oriented measures. We ask the Commission to support the Member States in the process of reprogramming their structural funds so that they can be strongly focused on economic growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The competitiveness of the EU and its economic and social development depend on ensuring a modern and efficient infrastructure for transport, energy and information and communication technology. The Connecting Europe Facility will help deal with bottlenecks and the problems with cross-border connections in trans-European transport, finalise the internal market for energy and create a fully functioning digital single market by 2015.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the United Kingdom we are still getting to grips with the ruinous financial inheritance left to us by the last Labour government. We have had to increase taxes and cut spending. I voted against the budget today because it proposes an increase in EU expenditure of 6.8 %. For the EU to demand such a large increase, indeed any increase, is grossly insensitive. It is difficult to think of anything more likely to alienate voters in the UK and across the whole of the EU. Why should Europe be getting more money, when almost every other public service is getting less? Why does the EU lecture Greece to cut spending, tell Ireland to raise taxes, force Spain to accept a bail-out and then demand more money for itself? At a time of austerity it is the height of hypocrisy for the EU to ask for more.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support David Cameron’s efforts to freeze EU expenditure. He is far more in touch with the citizens than the majority of Members of this spendthrift Parliament.</p>

According to Eurostat, fewer than one third of Europeans have a positive image of the EU. In my country, the EU is seen as wasteful and out of touch. If we are to restore credibility we need to rein in excess spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s inflation-busting 7 % increase in the budget is an insult to my constituents. While I would prefer to see a complete budget freeze, the Council’s proposal of 3 % is more acceptable. So why has this House voted to restore the Commission’s unrealistic demands? Perhaps it is because the Commission will go ahead and spend anyway. The Commission recently demanded a 10 billion top-up to its 2012 budget and this is an affront and an outrage. We must send a strong message to the Commission that it can no longer continue to squander its citizens’ taxes.</p>

      <p sl="en">EU governments are being forced to keep an ever-closer eye on their national spending.

It is, after all, the final year of the seven-year financial framework. That is why the Member States are sometimes not entirely fair in their dealings with the European Union. In the final year, for example, a relatively large number of projects are still being submitted and need to be end-financed. The very same Member States which received rebates in previous years are now focusing very strongly on compliance with financial discipline in 2013. In my view, we should deal fairly each other. Most of the funding allocated by the European Union ultimately goes to economic development and innovation; in other words, the funding is put to good use. In that spirit, I trust that we will deal fairly with each other.</p>

In view of that position, I believe that we should concentrate on constantly developing our IT infrastructure. We should strive to ensure that the public are increasingly able to use the internet to manage their affairs. One such example is the SOLVIT system, which is an effective extrajudicial means of settling disputes. However, further action needs to be taken to promote it among businesses and to boost its role in aiding the functioning of the internal market.

I hope that the vote we have held today, in which most people have had to put their name to their vote, will be sent around sites and discussion forums all over the EU, so that people can see who is mistreating their money and who is simply insisting on being given more.</p>

In my own region, EU-funded projects often sound attractive for jobs and skills, infrastructure and research, but the red tape reality is that running those projects often has huge costs and wastes, and these schemes could be better funded through national programmes or local grants.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not just want to tinker with EU funding, I want a fundamental review on how to reduce waste and excess, starting with getting rid of this Chamber but moving on to look at our staffing costs and benefits, so that there is not one set of rules for EU institutions and another for those who work locally. Then I want a root and branch review of every project so that the EU only funds projects where there is added value at international level in areas like our world-class science, where investment genuinely will boost growth and jobs.</p>

I regret to say that the European Union is increasingly seen by citizens as an additional burden to be borne by taxpayers, rather than an important resource.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that this situation is caused by the fact that the EU budget is not in line with national budgets, since it has not been expanded to take account of the duties and competencies assigned to the Union under the Treaty of Lisbon, or of the important political Decisions taken by the European Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU’s multiannual budget must be fit for purpose. Without a proper budget we cannot deliver on agreed aims and policies, in particular those set out in the EU 2020 strategy. Indeed, the budget is one of the most effective instruments we have to help create growth and jobs across Europe. Those who argue that the EU budget should be cut or frozen must spell out which EU policies they would take out.</p>
      <p sl="en">I firmly believe that 25 % of the cohesion funds should be allocated to the European Social Fund. This could help co-fund initiatives to tackle the growing problem of youth unemployment, such as the Youth Guarantee. In that context I welcome the Irish Government’s commitment to prioritising the Youth Guarantee Scheme during Ireland’s Presidency. Youth unemployment is currently running at 30 % in Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the Republic of Cyprus for handling the delicate multiannual financial framework negotiations so adeptly for the 2014-2020 period. This is the island state’s first experience of holding the EU’s rotating Presidency-in-Office. The Cypriots, like the British people, recognise the importance of value for money for the European Union, while emphasising the need for the EU to help create jobs and enable economic growth. Nevertheless, the British Prime Minister David Cameron has made it quite clear that at a time of austerity it is simply unacceptable to the British public to demand either an above-inflation increase or an end to the British rebate, particularly given the fact that the UK is the second largest net contributor. Member States should be warned that he is prepared to exercise the UK veto if necessary and go over to an annual emergency funding on a frozen budgetary basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is plenty of budgetary fat to be cut, and shutting down the Strasbourg Parliament would be a great place to start. Then we need to reform the CAP and reduce Structural Funds, particularly the European Social Fund, so that only things like research and development – both medical and scientific – or major infrastructure projects are given emphasis. At the moment, however, the British public really thinks that the EU is spending far too much money and could do a lot less and do a lot better.</p>

      <p sl="en">I rise in support of this bill, because it is of paramount importance in fixing the euro crisis.

They put on the first hat in Brussels. They are always saying that the European Union, the Commission, must take more vigorous action and that we should be launching new programmes for economic development and innovation, which need more money. As soon as they get home, they put on their second hat, and then the message that comes out of Europe’s capitals is, of course, that the Member States want to pay less to Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact of the matter – and we really do not need to dwell on this point for long – is that if we want to pay less to Brussels, we will also get less in return. That being the case, I would ask everyone to deal fairly with each other, taking into account, on the one hand, the difficult situation in the Member States but ensuring, on the other, that the programmes which the European Union needs in order to stimulate economic recovery in the Member States continue to be effective.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the budget for the current programming period has been implemented with the involvement of the new Member States, including Poland. We can see already how the monies allocated have aided their development and granted them equal economic opportunities. In spite of taking into consideration a series of important demands, this report warns against making cuts to the Commission’s proposal. In my opinion, the priority as far as the economy is concerned is to carry out the initiatives outlined with regard to the internal market. It is vital to guarantee funding in this area. That also involves making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access European Union financing. At the same time, we should take measures aimed at boosting entrepreneurship. An internal market that operates effectively obviously requires an appropriate level of consumer protection. I call for an increase in the resources allocated to this objective, as, in the current proposal, they are insufficient.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I have three comments on the multiannual financial framework. First, the amounts should be a bit lower. The EU should mainly confine itself to its core responsibilities. This was a good suggestion, for that matter, from President Schulz in the Dutch press last week, although I do not agree with his argument for centralisation at European level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another way to make significant savings is to deploy the Structural Funds exclusively in poor regions in the Member States with the lowest incomes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the matter of the EU having its own financial resources. Parliament would like the tax on financial transactions and VAT remittances to be used to finance the EU. This would be instead of the contributions from the Member States. This is not desirable. The Member States are less wasteful, as can be seen from the 2013 EU budget. The Member States have the authority to collect taxes and so it must remain. After all, the Union is here to serve the Member States, even though it may not seem that way in these economically difficult and tense times.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the vote that we held here earlier today on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) was probably the biggest, possibly not the most important, but the biggest vote by far that we will hold as members of the European Parliament. Close to DKK 1 000 billion has been waved through here, because we pushed the buttons and decided how the money in the EU should be spent from 2014 to 2020. The interesting thing was to see the protest in the room against my group – the EFD Group – having insisted on the individual votes having to be on a roll-call basis and in public, naturally so that citizens can see who has voted for what, given that it involves approximately DKK 1 000 billion to be used over a period including the next seven years, which is longer than any Commissioner or any Member of Parliament generally sits, without having to be held responsible to the voters. It is telling of the way in which Parliament and the EU system generally work that the further away from citizens the decisions can be made, and the more secretly it can be done, the less has to be entered in the accounts, and the better it is. This is not worthy of any democracy.</p>

The multiannual financial framework is obviously very important and, as has been said, it will be extremely important in terms of reaching an agreement at the Council’s meeting in November. However, as Mr Van Rompuy has stated, for that to happen, we will need political will and cooperation from all of the Member States, especially all of the Heads of State or Government. I hope that that will happen. My second point is that you, yourself, have taken leadership on the issue of the single seat, Mr President. I voted in favour of the single seat, too, because I do not believe that we should continue in the way we are at present given the carbon dioxide, expense and difficulties involved in travelling here, and especially because of the cost, which totals EUR 180 million.

The multiannual financial framework must offer greater budgetary flexibility in order to ensure that resources are fully used. Romania has difficulty absorbing European funds, and the goals for the end of this year were revised downward.

      <p sl="fr">There are still the same ultraliberal options that are supported no matter what: destruction of the social acquis and confinement within a policy of complete support for the competition that is corrupting our countries.

There is a high risk that Europe will sink further into the crisis, with finance the only beneficiary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is high time that we changed the guidelines completely. We need to give priority to the public services that can shield us from the crisis. We need concrete support for the development of jobs and protection of industry. We need to revitalise social protection by harmonising upwards and putting an immediate end to levelling downwards. We need to stop pitting citizens and workers against one another. Without these essential changes, Europe will not be able to get past the crisis.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the next report we voted on here concerns the EU’s own resources, and I voted against. This was not on the basis of the detailed amendments that will be made in relation to the collection of VAT from Member States, but because, as we all know very well, when we talk about own resources it means that the EU does not only want to prepare for having money sent to it in the form of a cheque from Member States once a year; it wants to put its hands directly into citizens’ pockets. Some people want it as a duty on aviation fuel, some want it as a direct VAT rate, others want it as a direct tax on financial transactions. The crucial thing is that, irrespective of which group we belong to, if we go in for EU taxes, we will eliminate the necessary link that must exist between being directly elected by citizens and having permission to obtain direct access to citizens’ pockets. This link simply does not exist in the EU, because in the EU it is the Commissioners who have the right of initiative, it is they who submit the proposals, it is they who execute the decisions, and in return they have the privilege of not being elected by anyone other than themselves and the government that has chosen to install them. The whole principle of own resources must therefore be dropped. It does not belong in a place like the EU.</p>

Moreover, the new system will bring significant advantages, as well as greater transparency, flexibility, security and predictability. Member States will benefit from equal treatment, and the administrative load will be reduced.

After long negotiations, this report was adopted by 492 votes to 123, with 82 abstentions. I welcome the result. The EU’s budget for 2012 totals just under EUR 150 billion and represents around 1 % of the GDP of the EU27. Even though the EU budget is still balanced, the Council wishes to cut more than EUR 5 billion from the estimated budget for 2013. However, the European Parliament wanted to increase payments by 6.82 % in comparison to 2012. My colleagues and I hope that the increase in payment appropriations will contribute directly to growth and employment in the EU.</p>

I would particularly like to stress the need to take a decision on locating the European Parliament’s seat in one place, and not, as has been the case up to now, in Brussels and in Strasbourg. Firstly, this would be a responsible attitude towards the resources paid in taxes by European citizens. Secondly, just like any directly elected parliament, the European Parliament ought to be entitled to decide on its own seat. Thirdly, this vote sends a clear message to Member States that the issue of Parliament’s seat must be resolved at the next intergovernmental conference, which will at some point be convened in order to review Europe’s agreements once again. Fourthly, this process must be begun, by preparing a guide to the shift to a single seat for Parliament, and by calculating all of the costs and assessing the gains and losses that such a decision would entail.</p>

It would also go against the statements by the Heads of State and Government in June, and this inconsistency on the part of the Council should be underlined. I would like to make a short statement on payments. Bills must be paid. This is a simple rule, as well as a legal obligation, and I hope that during the conciliation process the Council will accept an agreement that takes account, first and foremost, of the demands of European citizens, who are calling on us to invest in growth, the competitiveness of enterprises and above all in the creation of employment.</p>

As the EU cannot carry over monies unspent from previous years, we have been unable to build up any provision for these requests. However, Member States have had those unspent monies returned to their national budgets, where they can carry forward unspent monies: they are now unwilling to restore that money to the EU budget in order to meet commitments made – ironically, largely to Member States. I doubt if they will be willing to forgo those payments and will thus still expect payment. The monies owed are larger than the additional amount requested by Commission and Parliament. I was also angered during the vote by the hypocrisy of some Members who, while arguing for a reduced budget, then voted for additional and continuing funding for the ITER project which is, in my opinion, a waste of Union resources. We also failed to have a qualified majority to end export and tobacco subsidies, when we could find money by ending such damaging projects.</p>

These funds will be used for priority sectors for growth, such as the economy, research, entrepreneurship and employment. An amending budget was also presented to ensure the ‘survival’ of the Erasmus Mundus programme. This programme allows our young people to study right across Europe, enabling them to discover different cultures and languages, and it makes them aware of their European citizenship. As far as agriculture is concerned, most of the budget cuts proposed were also removed, and I am pleased about that.

The prudent approach at a time when there is huge pressure on public spending across Europe and people are under serious financial strain is to aim for a budget freeze if possible. That is why today we oppose Parliament and Commission’s position of a 6.8 % increase in the 2013 Budget. Once all the bills from Member States are presented for payment by next October, if there is a shortfall it can be addressed then through an amending budget. I welcome that Parliament has agreed a real-term cut in its own budget, frozen MEP allowances and cut MEP travel allowances by 5 %. I also welcome Parliament’s vote calling for an end to the circus of travelling to Strasbourg every month, with the largest majority ever.

In my opinion, the Commission’s draft budget (DB) reflects Parliament’s priorities as regards the programmes and initiatives to be reinforced towards these objectives. We are all aware of the severe difficulties arising from the state of the national economies and of the need for a responsible and realistic reading. We cannot accept, however, the approach whereby the EU budget is made the source of possible savings with the same proportion and logic as applied to the national budgets, given their substantial difference in nature, objectives and structure.

As a result, commitment appropriations will total EUR 151.2 billion, with payment appropriations rising to EUR 137.9 billion. I am firmly in favour of the cuts, as it is unacceptable for the EU budget to increase substantially every year while countries and regions are forced to make savings. There is plenty of scope to make savings in the countless agencies and administrations, for example, and this potential must now be utilised. Singling out students and putting a question mark over Erasmus is utterly abhorrent and clearly demonstrates to everyone how the EU does politics. As a result of the planned cuts, Parliament’s budget would face a shortfall of EUR 8.9 million compared with the Commission draft. Admittedly, this corresponds to a inflation-adjusted increase of 1.9 % compared with 2012, but nominally, that is, in real terms, it is a cut, as the additional costs arising from Croatia’s accession to the EU will result in a shortfall in other areas of the budget.</p>

I also voted in favour of a proposed amendment aimed at excluding, from the payment of premiums for the production of beef, bulls specifically bred to take part in bullfights. First, the breeding of these animals is basically motivated by objectives other than the production of beef, which is why it must be considered as falling outside the scope of this premium.

First of all, 2013 is the last year of the current multiannual financial framework and it is now extremely important to achieve a balance between the commitments made and the resulting payments. Otherwise, there may be a threat of legal consequences for the Commission in the event that justifiable claims for payments are not settled. Second, we have here the Europe 2020 strategy, the objectives of which cannot be achieved without financial support for growth, competitiveness and employment, especially with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises and young people. Moreover, implementation of this strategy should not forget regional competitiveness and employment in relation to local environmental conditions. Third, the reaction to the current eurozone crisis should be more Europe, not less Europe. The report reflects the above mentioned points, in other words the EU budget for 2013 should allocate more resources to investment and development priorities, not to administration. The report also warns of the pitfall of the horizontal cuts proposed by the Council. The EP prefers effective management.

As the EU has yet to overcome the economic crisis, the paralysing effect of the social crisis continues. Since a large number of Member States still suffer from a high rate of unemployment, it is essential to restore in the EU budget the means – EUR 1.9 billion – for promoting economic growth and employment. In a situation where the EU has greater commitments, that is to say, expenses, we cannot simply make cuts which subsequently create large budget gaps which must be ‘remedied’ in the future. It is regrettable that the cuts jeopardise useful programmes like Erasmus Mundus, Lifelong Learning and the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research.

As 2013 approaches, accompanied by the strong possibility of budget cuts (the talk is of savings in every possible sector), a situation may arise whereby there is not enough money to finance existing commitments. Already at risk is the European Social Fund, of vital importance because it benefits all EU citizens, whether they are in work or seeking employment, and many other EU programmes, including the Erasmus programme, which may suffer the biggest cuts. At a time of crisis, we should strengthen social protection for the unemployed, while creating growth in various workplaces, in both the public and private sector, which requires a high level of financial assistance.</p>

The common denominator between the two points of view is the strengthening of the competitiveness/profitability of the monopoly groups based in EU Member States, during the relentless conflict amongst themselves and with other imperialist centres and the emerging imperialist powers in their efforts to secure their profits and control the markets. The European Parliament proposes a restructuring of expenditure to strengthen the most reactionary features of the EU, such as the European External Action Service (EEAS), the Galileo space and military programme, centres of excellence in research, etc. The supposed robust opposition of the European Parliament (supported alike by the political representatives of capital and by opportunists) to a reduction in funding is another exercise in the stage management of popular forces, concealing the fact that any increase in funding is aimed at strengthening the monopoly groups and is accompanied by an intensified attack on the rights of the working class and popular strata.</p>

I am of the view that the Connecting Europe Facility aiming to improve Europe’s transport, energy and digital networks should be financed independently and not through the transfer of resources from the Cohesion Fund. If such a transfer does take place, these resources should be used in accordance with the national allocations under the Cohesion Fund. In view of the importance of the EU cohesion policy as a strategic instrument for investment, sustainable growth and competitiveness, I consider it vital that financing intended for the cohesion policy should be kept at least at the same level as in the 2007-2013 period and should continue to be available in particular to the less developed regions in the EU.</p>

I also welcome the more effective orientation of the MFF, emphasis being placed on investment and economic growth. Another new aspect in MFF 2014–2020 is the obligatory on-going audit of financial instruments and direct reaction to the audit results.

Instead of prioritising savings, the Commission and the majority of Parliament have chosen to demand increased expenses and the introduction of EU taxes. This increase is indefensible owing to the absence of priorities and in light of the substantial savings that the majority of Member States are making. The burden on citizens will not be reduced by introducing new own resources. We will help to solve Europe’s problem if the EU and Member States use their revenue efficiently and prioritise the most important expenditure. Large contributions to agriculture will not contribute to growth and new jobs, but investment in innovation and research will. The proposal for the long-term budget does not have any priorities for making a strong contribution to increased growth and competitiveness. The EU’s long-term budget must be modernised and streamlined. Obsolete lines must be reviewed and the money must instead be invested in areas that promote growth, such as research and development. Cohesion policy must focus on encouraging research, developing new initiatives, and infrastructure.

I would like to emphasise that we must avoid cutting not only the overall budget, but also the budget allocation for regional policy in the programming period 2014-2020. It is particularly important for ‘friends’ of cohesion policy, such as Hungary, that the interim report highlights EU cohesion policy as a strategic tool for investment, sustainable growth and competitiveness, as well as the main pillar of European solidarity. The European Parliament insists that this policy area must have a stable, solid and sustainable financial framework behind it and that funding should remain at least at the level of the 2007–2013 budget. In the light of all this, I find it unacceptable that, on the basis of the Commission’s proposal, Hungary would be the only EU Member State where per capita GDP in the period 2014–2020 would be consistently lower than 75 % of the EU average, while its cohesion funding could fall by as much as 30 % compared to the current budgetary period.

This will be the only way to exit the crisis and develop the European economy. In this context, I would highlight the importance of cohesion policy. Every study points to its added value. Given the huge disparities between EU regions, this policy clearly needs to be maintained and must never become an adjustment measure for other policies, such as those resulting, for example, from the emblematic initiatives of Europe 2020. Cohesion policy is the only policy that can simultaneously contribute to the five Europe 2020 objectives in the area of education, research and innovation, climate change, employment and the fight against poverty. Over 80 % of the EU budget depends on direct contributions from the national budgets. This means that each Member State seeks a ‘juste retour’, which leads to an unhealthy distinction between net contributors and recipients. That is why the EU needs genuine own resources.

The majority support the EU budget being subordinated to the Europe 2020 strategy (which favours the processes of privatisation, liberalisation and destruction of public services) and the predictable use of Cohesion Fund monies to extend the single market through the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’, by transferring public funds to large transport networks. In the context of the prevailing relationships within the EU, this will accentuate the dependence and subordination of countries such as Portugal on and to the major powers, which will not only find it easier to sell their products, but will also have access to our country’s resources.

      <p sl="fr">This was a key sitting for the European Parliament, which adopted its position to speed up the negotiations with the Council and the Commission on the multiannual financial framework, which will determine the EU’s actions and policies for the next seven years (2014-2020). The aim was thus to establish the European Parliament’s priorities and ‘red lines’ in preparation for the European Council meeting on the budget on 22 and 23 November. Although the European Parliament’s room for manoeuvre is limited by the Treaty of Lisbon (consent), it is a crucial power that allows it to influence the negotiations. With this vote, the European Parliament is thus seeking to preserve its prerogatives as well as the unity of the budget: now is not the time to fragment financing as this would affect the transparency and predictability of the European budget. The European Parliament recognised, however, that the introduction of some form of flexibility into the European budget would enable it to adapt better to any contingencies linked to the crisis and to any economic and structural changes.</p>

      <p sl="en">The next multiannual financial framework will most probably prove decisive for the European Union’s objectives regarding social and territorial cohesion, and particularly in the social inclusion of marginalised communities. I would like to welcome the fact that the Commission has introduced several instruments aiming at the complex development of underdeveloped regions, in line with the requirement for territorial targeting of the European Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies and I also welcome the proposal to earmark 5 % of the ERDF resources of each Member State for integrated urban strategies. The draft general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund establish the Integrated Territorial Investment, which enables Member States to allocate funding from several priority axes of the Operational Programmes for the purposes of multi-dimensional and cross-sectoral intervention. In this context the maximum extent of place-based approach should be considered, in order to unlock unused local capabilities. Furthermore, the Community-led Local Development, as a set of multi-fund financed strategies with an integrated bottom-up approach may play a significant role in the inclusion of marginalised communities, including Roma, when properly used and may represent an effective tool for the involvement of the concerned communities themselves.</p>

We cannot vote against a policy of growth and investment aimed at improving living standards and education and creating jobs. We set ourselves goals in the Europe 2020 strategy and we must achieve them. We need to remain credible and fight for what we promised 500 million citizens. Limiting expenditure in the EU’s next multiannual financial framework will cause growth to slow and make it harder to recover from the crisis. Let us remember that the EU budget is an investment budget and cannot be compared to national budgets. In view of the need to make a quick decision regarding a budget that determines the EU’s every action, I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.</p>

We feel that the EU’s aims and objectives should be met within the framework of the Commission’s proposal, through clear priorities and strategic reductions, not through an increased budget. Therefore, for example, we voted against the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and in favour of an end to Parliament’s travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg.

As you know, the Commission’s proposal to some extent freezes expenditure at the levels of the preceding MFF, and thus, in our view, it is not a suitable proposal for taking on the global challenges that we will be facing in the coming years. This applies above all to the common agricultural policy, where the Commission’s cuts are not in line with the needs of the sector.

They bow to or even consciously exploit the anti-European sentiments which arose in some countries. However, reducing the European budget means hurting one’s own economy as much as that of the other Member States. The EU budget redistributes 94 % back to the Member States and is largely devoted to investments. Those investments are proven to boost economic growth, not only in the cohesion countries but also with the so-called net payers. The European Parliament has to make a stand for this investment budget and has to oppose any cuts. The budgetary austerity which some Member States also want to impose onto the EU is a self-defeating strategy. The EU does not have any debts to pay off and has one of the lowest rates of spending on its own administration.

It warns EU governments against any attempt to reduce further the level of EU expenditure proposed by the Commission. Members also call for an increase in investment in competitiveness and research, and for the funding available for agricultural and cohesion policy to be maintained, at the very least, at current levels. Other specific proposals include demands for a reform of the EU’s own resources system based on the value added tax which flow directly into the EU budget. Overall, then, the resolution is mainly about a further increase in the EU budget. Such a move must be rejected on principle at a time of austerity. Given that municipalities, regions and countries have no option but to pursue rigorous austerity measures, the EU’s urge to spend more and more money is completely unreasonable. What we need, in many areas, is for competences to be transferred away from the EU and handed back to the Member States. This would dramatically reduce the EU’s demand for funding.

The EU budget is one of the solutions and an incentive for Europe to emerge from the current crisis. For the EU to become a leading economy in the future, once it has overcome the crisis and its consequences, it is necessary to invest in spheres that promote growth and new jobs, education, research and innovative, competitive production.

The largest reduction is in direct payments (from EUR 322 billion to EUR 281 billion (-12 %). The Commission aims to introduce greater fairness in the distribution of payments (by bringing all countries closer to the EU average aid per hectare). I do not agree with the general outline of the CAP budget proposal for allocation of direct payments, which is based exclusively on the quantitative criterion of farmland and is contrary to the objective of growth and employment. I voted in favour, hoping that the reform of the CAP will not go ahead, as it would render it too burdensome.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The EU’s budget must be used on what can offer European added value. This is one of the linchpins of work on the budget and it is also what must govern the allocation of the common resources that the Union has at its disposal. There is no problem in that regard. The interim report adopted in plenary on 23 October places great emphasis on new own resources for the EU. This means the Financial Transaction Tax, which I firmly maintain is detrimental to Sweden and to Europe. Too often, ‘own resources’ means a tax that must be paid directly into the EU budget. More money for the EU in the form of own resources does not automatically constitute an investment that will help Europe with its stresses and strains. Instead, priorities need to be set using the resources available now. It is important to note that a Tobin tax was tried in Sweden and proved to be harmful. Transactions were moved away from Sweden. In addition, it is obviously important for me to emphasise that the cost of the FTT would hit the average consumer and that economic growth would be impeded. Since so much focus is being placed on own resources and requirements for a Financial Transaction Tax, I chose to vote against the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">The multiannual financial framework defines the EU budget for the 2014-2020 period. In June 2011 the European Commission presented a proposal of EUR 1 083 billion in expenditure, corresponding to 1.11 % of European Gross Domestic Product and an increase of 5 % in relation to the current programming period (2007-2013). I would argue that the EU budget must be reinforced, which is in line with the European Commission’s proposal and advocated by the Friends of Cohesion group consisting of 15 Member States. At a time of heightened economic and financial difficulties, it is vital to reinforce European investment in a wide range of areas (such as cohesion policy, agriculture, research and innovation). Only in this way will it be possible to grow economically, create jobs and improve the social situation of European citizens. I wish to point out that I do not agree with the pre-allocation of 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, on the basis that there should be sufficient flexibility for Member States and the European regions to define their strategic priorities. Lastly, I must oppose the sharp reduction (47 %) in the specific additional allocation for the outermost and sparsely populated regions, in the hope that the budget amounts will be amended at the Council meetings.</p>

With budgetary guidelines such as these, there is no chance of Europe emerging from the chaos that it has created. Above all, we need to give priority to the public services that can shield us from the crisis. We need to provide concrete support for the development of jobs and industry, instead of finance, by seeking a public dimension to finance aimed at providing special support for projects and people rather than profit.

It will be difficult to solve this equation if the Member States persist with their double refusal to increase their contributions and approve own resources to take their place. Mr Sarkozy’s France initiated a dynamic that resulted in a Financial Transaction Tax, the revenue from which will go to the EU budget, thereby decreasing the contributions of the countries that apply it, and that is the first positive sign. In these negotiations, Parliament will defend several ‘red lines’: the budget will have to be a catalyst for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth, it will have to be flexible enough to cope with structural and economic changes, and it will have to support the projects with high European added value.

This proposal is even more manipulative as, by invoking ‘the consolidation efforts of Member States’, it is trying to create the idea of inevitability. However, as we have proposed, another method could and should be used, which would improve the current regime.

The draft regulation for making the VAT own resource available is necessary to define the method Member States should use to calculate this new resource as well as the procedures for its transfer into the EU budget. The new EU VAT own resource proposal represents undoubtedly an important improvement to the current system and has serious potential to develop into a stable and reliable genuine own resource for the Union’s budget. The VAT own resource should be part of a general reform of the own resources system, which should substantially decrease the overall level of national contributions by Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Value added tax was conceived as the basis for calculating part of the EU contribution. In the meantime, the system for calculating own resources has become extremely complex, as a number of factors must be considered. A new proposal has now been presented for the calculation of own resources. There can be no objections to making adjustment to take account of the overseas territories or the specific VAT treatment granted in certain regions. The new standard percentages are, in effect, a way of punishing Member States with a lean administration. Furthermore, the largest share of calculations currently done by Member States would in future be moved to the European Commission. Both these aspects constitute a further step towards centralisation and undermine national competences, something which I vigorously oppose.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Own resources for the EU budget and the proper collection of these are a prerequisite for ensuring that the budget itself is effective. Nevertheless, with regard to VAT, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that when aligning the rate of VAT throughout the European Union, we need to carefully consider the opportunities that states currently have to apply various reduced VAT rates, mostly for social objectives. On the one hand, this tax cannot be used as a hidden form of state support for one sector or other, while on the other hand, throughout the EU we need to establish the areas where states can derogate from common rules.</p>

      <p sl="el">The issue of transfer of taxes from the Member States to the EU budget has occupied the Union almost since its foundation. This regulation proposes a specific method which the Member States must use to calculate this new VAT resource and to determine the procedures for transferring it to the EU budget. According to the proposal, the new VAT own resource of the European Union is based on the percentage of VAT on goods and services offered, acquisitions and imports which are subject to a standard rate of VAT in each Member State. This ensures greater transparency and a reduced need for corrections to the VAT base. Nevertheless, the complicated method of calculation is still there, and today a question mark still hangs over the question of paying the tax directly into the EU budget without the need for it to be collected first by the national authorities. For this reason, I voted in favour of this report, which embraces the Commission’s positive proposals while at the same time highlighting the shortcomings and the further action and initiatives that need to be taken.</p>

The draft regulation on the procedure for making the VAT own resource available is necessary to define the method Member States should use to calculate this new resource as well as the procedures for its transfer into the EU budget. At its inception in 1970, the VAT-based own resource was designed as a potentially genuine own resource, under the assumption that a continuous process of harmonisation of national VAT legislation would eventually render the national VAT assessment bases fully harmonised. However, it has gradually been transformed into a complex and opaque statistical device that actually represents another form of GNI-based contribution and is transferred from national budgets. The VAT-based own resource represents 11.2 % of revenue in the 2011 budget. On 29 June 2011 the Commission presented its proposals for a new multiannual financial framework 2014 - 2020 jointly with a set of proposals on the reform of the Union’s own-resources system.</p>

      <p sl="en">The multiannual financial framework defines the EU budget for the 2014-2020 period. In June 2011 the European Commission presented a proposal of EUR 1 083 billion in expenditure, corresponding to 1.11 % of European gross domestic product and an increase of 5 % in relation to the current programming period (2007-2013). In order to reduce the contribution by Member States to the EU budget to 40 %, the European Commission has presented the possibility of creating own resources which are enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this respect, I consider the introduction of the Financial Transaction Tax and the modernisation of VAT to be appropriate, with the current European resource of part of the national VAT collected by Member States being abandoned. I support the creation of these own resources provided that businesses and households do not have to pay more for the goods and services that they purchase. I also support the statement made by the President of the European Commission that this is not about increasing the EU budget, but about giving it a more solid basis and reducing the direct contributions of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The new calculation method uses actual VAT receipt figures as a starting point. To achieve greater simplicity and transparency, the regulation proposes that the Commission establish a uniform percentage at EU level, from VAT accruing from supplies of goods and services by final consumption that are subject to a standard rate in each Member State. The resulting value of the ‘assumed VAT receipts’ is then divided by the actual standard rate applied in the country to give the VAT own resources base. Once this has been calculated, the actual contribution is calculated by applying a percentage that is set out in the implementing Council Regulation on own resources.</p>

I abstained on this proposal by the European Commission because it risks pushing for a harmonisation of increased VAT rates, in line with the proposals to increase VAT, wrongly described as ‘social’ by the right, in France, in exchange for a reduction in employers’ social contributions.</p>

Research is an uncertain process involving a certain amount of inherent risk, and result-based funding might limit the scope of the research projects to less risky projects and market-oriented research, which would hamper the EU in pursuing excellence and frontier research. Unfortunately, a too rigid interpretation of the Financial Regulation has in recent years created a culture of risk avoidance and a zero-trust attitude towards participants in research programmes, thus reducing the efficiency of its implementation. It is therefore important to proceed urgently with a simplification of the financial and administrative provisions relating to the framework programme and other European funding instruments. Simplification should not be regarded as an end in itself, but as a means to ensure the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding, and simplification measures should offer greater potential for avoiding errors. As regards operating grants in the form of lump sums or flat-rate financing, I am of the view that the rule that grants should gradually decrease should be removed.</p>

Despite believing that greater transparency and the presentation of accounts on the implementation of the EU budget are important and necessary, certain articles included in the proposal adopted today do not merit our agreement. The European Financial Stability Mechanism has been included, which thus guarantees its financing. The final proposal extends the possibility of creating public-private partnerships. As a way of tackling the lack of resources, mainly in the areas of energy, transport, research and digital infrastructures, it is proposed that the Commission ‘entrusts the budget implementation to public-private partnerships’.

The amendments made to the Commission proposal, which are supported by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), have significantly improved this text and achieved the universally desired objective of creating a more agile, more dynamic and, at the same time, more transparent European Union in terms of making available and applying the relevant funds.</p>

Taken together, these rules (which include over 500 amendments negotiated with the Council over a period of almost one year) will provide us, from 1 January 2013, with new, more efficient and more effective legal and operational instruments for facing the challenges of an economic and political crisis.</p>

Although the EU is one of the world’s largest donors, it only contributes to existing funds, namely those of the United Nations or World Bank, which results in limited visibility for the EU with regard to its performance and priorities. As a result, these new rules will give the Commission independence to establish investment funds as an international cooperation instrument, which are extremely important tools for disaster and development aid operations. The budget rules also include the innovation of incentive premiums, which are an instrument for promoting research projects. It is also proposed to extend the obligations for EU Member States to present reports, particularly with regard to the use of Structural Funds. The Commission receives further rights and duties over national payment agencies and supervisory authorities. The rules on audits and sanctions for irregularities will also be improved, with a view to harmonising the complexity and number of financial rules. I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe that Europe can successfully meet the challenges of the crisis through its budgetary policies. With the right selection of priorities, starting with growth and innovation for the rural areas of Europe, it can send out a strong message of change. The economic power of those working within the production chain needs to be strengthened through positive budgetary action at the level of the European institutions in the first instance, rather than at local level. Negotiations with the Council will lead to a correct application of European programmes, maintaining a strong common agricultural policy through a stable budget for agriculture. Reforms in the sector can provide an effective reference framework for strengthening the rest of the economy. Growth, which is at the centre of Parliament’s agenda, will be pursued through a series of funding measures aimed at attaining long-term objectives, starting with enhancing the competitiveness of European agricultural enterprises in the global context.

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Sweden in support of those who lost their jobs in the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The Swedish authorities maintain that the pharmaceutical sector is increasingly hard-hit by globalisation. It is clear that the negative consequences of globalisation further highlight the added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as an EU social policy tool. The targeted financial support which it provides for retraining and reintegration programmes for workers affected by mass dismissals is particularly important. Furthermore, the support it provides is a practical expression of the Union’s solidarity. Lastly, the case of Sweden is the best demonstration of the fact that this financial instrument does not confine its operation to countries facing economic and budgetary challenges, but may prove equally useful in helping dismissed workers to reintegrate into the labour market even in economically robust countries. This in turn underlines the importance of the Fund and demonstrates the need to retain it during the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>

I support this report because I agree with simplifying and harmonising the rules and procedures applicable to the European Union’s framework programmes in the area of research, and because I consider that the risk of error should be indicated in order to promote sound financial management and appropriate controls in the area of cohesion policy.

The regulation lays down the rules governing the establishment and implementation of the EU’s general budget and the presentation and auditing of the accounts. The budget is established and implemented in accordance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency. The regulation promotes the use of e-Government, especially electronic exchanges of information between the institutions and third parties. In accordance with Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the regulation strengthens Member States’ basic control and audit obligations where they implement the budget under shared management, since such obligations currently exist only in sector-specific rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to present to this House the Commission’s work programme for 2013, which has just been adopted by the College, which is still in session, because this programme is the culmination of an intense political dialogue and very close collaboration between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had very good collaboration with the Conference of Committee Chairs. The structural dialogue between the Commission and the sectoral committees was much deeper than last year and the debate after the State of the Union address, the recent exchange of views between the Commission and the Conference of Committee Chairs, and the exchange between the Conference of Presidents and myself have all been information sources which contributed to the preparation of the Commission’s work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was quite clear from all these discussions that this programme has to focus on how the EU can best contribute to what is our most pressing priority: reviving growth and creating jobs. 2013 will indeed be a decisive year in turning Europe round to face up to the crisis and to pursue the path of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. As we listened to the exchanges this morning, we could all conclude that there is no one silver bullet, and that all levels of society must contribute. But we are at EU level and we have to look at how the EU level can help to show a lead and make sure the result of our action will be a strong record to put before the electorate in 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this in mind, the Commission’s priorities are clustered around seven key policy areas. The first covers moving towards a genuine EMU. Here it is quite clear that a deep and genuine economic union must be based on political, and hence more democratic, union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second is boosting competitiveness through the single market and industrial policy. The third is building fully integrated networks in telecoms, energy and transport as a prerequisite for competitiveness, jobs and growth. The fourth is growth for jobs: supporting employment services, promoting social inclusion and entry into labour markets, with special measures to help vulnerable groups, notably young people who are faced with a huge unemployment pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fifth is using Europe’s resources to compete better. The sixth priority is to provide greater safety and security to all EU citizens and the seventh – last, but not least – strengthening the EU as a global actor, notably to unleash all our potential in trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">For each of these seven key policy areas, the work programme sets out clearly the long-term vision and objectives, summarises what is missing and explains how the Commission will take up the challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, let me briefly take you through some of the main priorities. The details of building a genuine economic and monetary union are the subject of a deep reflection. As this morning’s debate showed, the discussion will continue but the Commission will present shortly its blueprint, which should be a contribution to this debate. It will show how to have an ambitious approach, based on existing institutions to ensure full democratic control. Making this happen will be the key priority for next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">This also means modernising the ways that we generate public revenue – at European and at national level. The Commission has responded today to the request from those Member States who wish to move ahead quickly on a Financial Transaction Tax. Large and small Member States determined to pioneer a new way to make everybody shoulder their fair share.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will therefore continue to push for a strong and competitive financial sector to restore growth and investment in the real economy. I see, for instance, that good progress is already being made on the credit rating agencies file in Parliament and in the Council. In 2013, we will address shadow banking, and put key indices used in the financial sector on a stronger footing. Businesses and home owners cannot be open to manipulation of the interest rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we are not starting from scratch. The legislation this House has passed has already transformed the financial sector to a great extent. The European Semester is now established as a key pillar of economic governance. But to restore the confidence of citizens and markets we must go further and together.</p>
      <p sl="en">If stability is the basis for sustainable growth and jobs, competitiveness and confidence are the engines. Europe’s economy can only survive with a strong and modern industrial base and our companies can only win away if the home field provides an optimal platform.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we need a strong single market. We need to fill regulatory gaps. We need to unleash the growth potential in networks and the digital economy. We need to exploit mobility and we need to use cohesion policy as a driver for reform, not just as the safety net.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will have seen the ideas put forward by the Commission in its Industrial Policy Flagship and Single Market Acts. Building on the progress made in the first phase, we should all pull together to make sure that these actions are developed, agreed and implemented before June 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">Agreement on the package for the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 is critical. It offers the kind of smart investment the EU economy needs and, subject to an agreement being found, we will need to devote a lot of attention and effort next year to the finalisation of sectoral instruments and programming of the next generation of projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next year will also see new initiatives in key areas: on access to finance, in particular for SMEs; on cutting costs in areas like VAT; on leveraging investment in strategic sectors from aeronautics to pharmaceuticals; on broadband infrastructure and electronic payments. We also need to give investors long-term certainty and long-term vision about the society they live in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Modernising infrastructure in ICT, energy and transport is critical to providing this certainty. So too is a fresh look at European air and waste legislation. This is, in particular, why we need a framework for climate and energy policy to 2030.</p>
      <p sl="en">To build the future, Europe must build on its youth. Youth unemployment is a crisis within the crisis. The human tragedy and the economic loss of leaving a generation on the sidelines is something that we can neither allow, nor afford as a society. While many of the levers are national, there is much that Europe can do to invest in its people, to increase mobility between jobs and across borders, to target education and training in the right skills, and to protect the most vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Semester is proving a key tool to stimulate job creation and to bring closer a truly European labour market. Amongst new proposals will be very practical measures to network national employment services to work together. I hope also that the proposals we are preparing for December of this year on employment packages, especially on youth guarantee, will be one of the priorities for this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are a community of values. At a time when our attention is directed at the economy, we must not lose sight of this: our freedoms sustain our prosperity. To grow and create jobs we must continue to safeguard and expand the freedoms of citizens. The EU must also protect its citizens by adapting to new threats and challenges. Concrete action next year to fight arms traffic, improve judicial cooperation and protect financial interests through a European Public Prosecutor will all help to ensure that citizens and companies can exercise their freedoms and rights in security.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2013, the Commission will also continue relentlessly to defend European values and interests around the world. In external trade this can make a huge difference, with the potential for 2 million new jobs in the medium term. Possible agreements with partners such as Japan and the United States would have a huge impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe must continue to show that it is a positive force worldwide. This was very clearly recognised by the Nobel Prize Committee. Effective development and humanitarian aid will be directed to those most in need and an active enlargement and neighbourhood policy will continue to make the EU an anchor of peaceful development in our region and beyond. Once again, putting the new generation of programmes in place will make a key contribution to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, these are crucial years for Europe. The steps we take over the next few years will decide our future path. We must direct our energies to making the most of the rest of this legislature, bringing all key proposals to their conclusion before 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is looking forward to working closely with Parliament and the Member States to move from programme to progress and to take the next decisive concrete steps together towards a stronger, more prosperous and fairer Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, with your permission, before speaking on the matter in hand I, too, would like to mention, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the struggle for liberation that took place in the revolution of 1956, which began exactly 56 years ago. I would also like to call to mind, however, the sad incident that took place in 2006, when the incumbent government launched an attack on its own citizens, seriously violating their civil liberties. This was a disgraceful way to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution.</p>
      <a text="(The speaker continued in English.)"/>
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would say to Vice-President Šefčovič that the Commission work programme for 2013 is a key strategic programming document. Our Parliament, in the different committees and also in plenary, has been dealing with this for quite a long time. We have not seen the new text, so we can only learn from what the Vice-President of the Commission says, but I would like to welcome the readiness on the part of the Commission to take on board some of the elements which were discussed here in Parliament just a month ago and which were included in our resolution in September.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Obviously at this time of crisis we have to be more aware of programming, but I would also like to stress – as we stressed in the resolution – that the Commission and Parliament have to be flexible and react quickly to the difficult situation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to enumerate some of the points which our group, the European People’s Party, take as a condition for the support of the Commission work programme. Obviously we give our support when the Commission plays its full role in defending the Community method. We encourage and would like to see better use of delegated acts, which is a clear distinction in the new Lisbon Treaty. This must help our controlling role over the Commission’s work and, obviously, the work of the other institutions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also support the Commission when it is ready to further reduce the regulatory burden or to identify the regulatory areas which are really important from the point of view of the crisis. Obviously we cannot say in general that we should deregulate everything. There are areas which the crisis has shown need more regulation, but the regulatory burden as such should be reduced. We also support the Commission when it is ready to improve the implementation and the rate and timing of EU legislation. If we are making laws here in Parliament, it is in vain if the Member States or the application of that legislation is not affected.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would also like to support the political ambition and vision of the European Union in the global world, especially in the light of what President Barroso said at the September part-session in his speech on the state of the Union. Obviously we, as Members of Parliament who are directly elected, are accountable for the European Union’s action and lack of action, so we rightly demand added value. We are also ready to respond quickly to different situations and to use the fast-track procedure whenever it is needed for the good of European citizens. But we are also responsible for checking and controlling the Commission and other European institutions with regard to the efficient use of taxpayers’ money. We would also like to support the line of the Commission in the area of cohesion policy. You mentioned youth unemployment, which was also part of our discussion last time, and also the employability of elderly people and supporting mobility.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would also like to underline and stress – as the Vice-President has stressed – the creation of the necessary measures in order to strengthen the European industrial base. This is a very important point for our party, as is the full implementation of the internal market with a binding calendar.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My last point stems from this: when we are doing something – and the Commission work programme should be exactly about that – showing a roadmap and a binding calendar of how we are going to proceed the next year – it should be with flexibility and reactivity, because our responsibility does not stop at fulfilling pre-designed patterns but also extends to creating an innovative reaction to the different elements and events of the crisis. I would like to express, with these conditions, support for the Commission work programme on behalf of the European People’s Party.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commission Vice-President, in his State of the Union address and in other speeches, Mr Barroso has indicated that the employment crisis is fundamental to solving the broader economic crisis. He has also told us that the reform agenda will work only if it is fair and equitable, because inequality is unsustainable. Finally, he has stated that Europe’s global competitiveness will depend on its social model. I believe that this is a sound assessment of the situation and that the intentions are correct, but they are nothing more than fine words, because between Mr Barroso’s statements and the Commission’s work programme there is a virtually unbridgeable gulf.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us look at how the 2012 work programme has turned out. More than half of the Commission’s programme has not been implemented. Work has yet to be completed in areas such as renewal of the strategy on health and safety, workers’ rights, the right to bodily integrity and workers’ freedom of movement. All of this affects the lives of EU citizens, as does the Tobacco Directive, a revised version of which we hope to see before this Parliament very soon.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has therefore failed on 2012, and yet it disappoints with regard to 2013. Where are the measures aimed at tackling youth unemployment? What can we expect from the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion? Where are the commitments on social dialogue?</p>
      <p sl="es">Youth unemployment in Europe lies above 20 % and, in many countries, is higher than 50 %. The ‘Youth Guarantee’ is to be welcomed, but it requires a strategy that is more aggressive and better coordinated.</p>
      <p sl="es">The biggest problem with the work programme, however, is its failure to address social and employment questions. The Treaties call for the promotion of employment and guarantees relating to citizens’ lives to be coordinated with social protection and economic considerations, but the Commission has opted for an inflexible strategy of price stability and fiscal discipline, a strategy that is not working and is, moreover, self-defeating.</p>
      <p sl="es">If our experience teaches us anything, it is that monetary union is unsustainable without economic and social union. That is why we, like the Vice-President, are calling for this broader social governance to be included as part of the European Semester, for the European Semester to incorporate a more inclusive vision and social investment that ties in with the Europe 2020 goals. We need to realise that economic and monetary union is not an end in itself, but an instrument for ensuring the welfare of citizens; we therefore require a youth guarantee, a social protocol guaranteeing social rights and an active employment policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, we count on the Commission’s support in upholding the Union method and in order to prevent reforms that will undermine the position of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">With my last point, I would like to stress the need for the European Union to undertake to ensure the distribution of food to the millions of EU citizens living in poverty, who are the responsibility of the European Union and not just of the Member State governments or national authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Barroso spoke of publishing his blueprint on all the building blocks that we need for genuine economic and monetary union. I was not clear whether such building blocks would include a draft proposal for a redemption fund, and I would be very grateful for Commissioner Šefčovič to clarify this. It will be extremely problematic for Parliament to agree on the ‘two-pack’ in the absence of progress on the redemption fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, following the unfortunate disappearance of former Commissioner Dalli, what is the fate of the Tobacco Products Directive? This is an issue of great interest to Parliament and Mr Šefčovič is in command of the portfolio of former Commissioner Dalli at present and might be able to tell us this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, it is of course splendid that we are having more plans for lawmaking in the single market area, but we have to appreciate that the present package of single market law is still far from complete. The Services Directive, which is a key element in this, is not properly in force yet in several Member States. The Patents Directive is still out there craving for a solution and the ALDE Group would wish to emphasise the importance of completing current programmes of implementing the law that we have worked on and ought to be in force before we can see our way clearly to the final sunny uplands of a single market that will appear to be more complete.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are going to give our opinion this week on the discharge of European agencies that are under suspicion about their management, since our institutions are deemed to be too open to the lobbies and it seems that the transparency measures taken so far have not succeeded in resolving these problems, since we rightly want exemplary, certified institutions without any conflicts of interest, since the Commission’s reputation is once again in tatters, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but also on behalf of numerous other Members of the European Parliament of all political persuasions, I want to ask you about the resignation of John Dalli and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, which has been planned for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of my Group, as one of those who worked on the work programme and also as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market, I welcome the set of initiatives which have been put in front of us. There is nothing particularly unexpected in them, but I want to make a broader point, if I may, about presentation.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I say to Mr Šefčovič that this is not actually the Commission’s work programme at all. This is a list of new initiatives. But, as a number of my colleagues have pointed out, the continuing work on projects started during 2012 – and even earlier – which have yet to be completed is as important as the new initiatives. Also, a really important part of the Commission’s work – and here I support what a number of colleagues have said already – is actually the implementation and enforcement of existing regulations and directives.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, in the area with which I am most familiar, we will complete next year, I am sure, a major review of the public procurement directives. That will require an intensive transposition and training programme across Member States to make it really effective. I would say to Commissioner Šefčovič, that in future his work programme has to be the whole work programme. We do not just want to see the new initiatives; we also want to see the progress which is going on in those areas, because that is a crucial part of your role in the Commission. We want to see that programmed, we want to see what you are doing and we want to be engaged with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleague, Andrew Duff, mentioned the Services Directive, which my committee has been working on extremely actively. This brings me to the second thing which is completely absent from the programme. Here at the back we have a list of your ideas about the proposals which are simplifying regulation, but I want to remind you that in our resolution on the work programme – which you commented on – we specifically asked the Commission to improve the quality of its legislative drafting and also to deal with the concerns we have about the qualitative impact assessment procedure and how well that is working. There is nothing about this in here at all. Why not? We know that the Secretary-General of the Commission is working on a review of that, which is not mentioned in here either.</p>
      <p sl="en">So do better next time, please. Send us a proper work programme: initiatives, continuity, quality, implementation. Let us make this work properly, Mr Šefčovič; let us not have a partial programme, and please also stop dressing up these ideas with new little sub-initiatives. Let us get down to the real meat of doing our job better together.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is much to think about in the Commission’s work programme; but, as always, the devil is in the detail – and we need to hear much more detail, particularly with regard to the seven policy areas to which it refers. We look forward to making a constructive and positive input on the proposals, which have the potential to benefit the people of Europe. Taken as a whole, however, the work programme is, we believe, another missed opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission needs to come up with a radically new approach. There is no mention at all of the tobacco directive, which is already long overdue. The work programme needs to put people’s needs before profits, and it needs to recognise that the austerity measures are particularly detrimental to women and children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Child poverty has increased as a result of the austerity measures. I listened intently to what you had to say about growth and jobs. Despite the upbeat rhetoric, measures to invest in jobs and growth are half-hearted and under-funded, and are rendered somewhat ineffective by the ideological attachment to the policies of austerity. Already we have 25 million people unemployed across Europe, and that number is growing.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is disappointing that the work programme does not address at all the failed policies of chasing after Third World conditions in employment and public services. We will not get out of this crisis by lowering wages and destroying jobs and public services, cutting spending and pouring billions of pounds into the banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the September State of the Union address by President Barroso, I said that he needed to give his head a shake. I respectfully suggest, Mr Vice-President, that you need to do the same, and get a better understanding of the damage that has been caused to peoples’ lives by the severe austerity measures that are being run through the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, next year the Commission intends, among other activities, to continue implementing the climate and energy package. Indeed, 2013 will also see the transition to the third phase of the European Union’s emissions trading system. In this regard, the Commission is fighting for ever greater powers to interfere in national politics and with the competitiveness of individual economies. Neither Parliament nor the Member State governments should agree to this. The proposal for a decision on the timing of auctions of CO2 allowances is just one of the actions put forward by the Commission that could plunge national economies even further into crisis, in particular countries such as Poland, whose industry is dependent on coal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, I am hopeful that the Commission’s work programme for the next year will also include my compatriots’ proposal, registered as one of the first citizens’ initiatives, to suspend the climate and energy package that is so damaging to our part of Europe. We support this initiative and will view it as a test for the Commission and the Member States. The Commission has, after all, proposed that next year should be the European Year of Citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission’s priorities are directed towards greater integration as an end in itself and not towards measures that will solve the real economic problems facing the populations of Europe. The greatest of course is the recession, with its unemployment and under-employment, squeezed incomes and reduced benefits. Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="en">One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will try to react to the comments made in the interventions by the honourable Members concerning the Commission’s work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very sorry that I was not able to deliver the text of the Commission’s work programme because it was approved just one-and-a-half hours ago. We had wanted to present it to the House immediately. However, now it has been adopted, I am sure that it will be available very soon, today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the relationship between delegated and implementing acts, we have been working together with Mr Szájer on a common understanding on how to use delegated acts and how to use implementing acts. We both agree that the source of our proposals, whether we propose delegated or implementing acts, should be the Treaty, because it is very clear on what kind of policies you need delegated acts for and for what kind of policies you need implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was a topic we discussed at great length with the Conference of Presidents and with the Conference of Committee Chairs. What we agreed was that we need to coordinate much better in our legislative process, and much earlier on, because what happens sometimes is that the delegated versus implementing act issue becomes a bargaining chip at the end of negotiations, which is not correct. Very often this makes things legally unsound, and the Commission has very often had to approach the European Court of Justice to reverse some of the decisions which have been adopted in the legislative process following the choice in our review of the wrong legal instrument for a particular legislative proposal. A suggestion would be to cooperate closer early on, to respect the Treaty and not to use delegated or implementing acts as a bargaining chip at the end of the legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the regulatory burden, here we have absolutely the same view, which is that we need to reduce it. The Commission has already put on the legislative table proposals for reducing the administrative burden by more than 31 %. It is now our common task – and the Commission will take this very seriously – to see how this possibility is actually being used at Member State level. We are working together very intensely, but we do not always see all the simplifications we have introduced at European level trickle down to the national level. We have to continue to work on this together, so that the real reduction of the administrative burden is also felt at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Mr Harbour that there is always something to learn and improve on when it comes to the impact assessments. I consider we have been doing this for some time already, and I am very glad that the European Parliament is also introducing its own capacity to perform impact assessments on the amendments proposed in Parliament. I believe that through mutual efforts we can really improve the quality of the overall impact assessments for our proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning our efficiency, for the year 2012 there is a proposal for 16 main initiatives. We have delivered eight already, and it is still not the end of the year. So I believe we will respect our traditional high level of fulfilment of our programmes. I have checked the figures, and in 2010-2011 we always delivered on over 90 % of what was in the programme. If we have slightly different figures, then let our experts get together so they can work on the same basis and arrive at the same figures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the employment crisis, I fully agree with Enrique Guerrero Salom that this should be a top priority for the next year, as I indicated in my introductory remarks. This December we will introduce the youth employment package, as part of which we will propose the Youth Employment Guarantee Scheme. This will be based a little on the experience we have gathered through the work of the eight action teams we sent to the Member States with the highest youth unemployment. We believe that through the quick and swift reallocation of funds – which in most cases has already been done – we can create more than 400 000 jobs for young people that will be supported directly by the EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">This morning we were discussing the MFF. I can tell you that in my remarks to the Council there is one line which is repeated in all my remarks – make sure that 25 % of the EU funds under the next financial perspective are devoted to the European Social Fund. The Commission is very clear on this. We are saying that any kind of reduction in that percentage is not acceptable. I hope that we will be able to convince the Member States of this, because I also see it as a reflection of our using EU support to create the conditions for youth and the elderly to be employed and to have proper qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last issue, which was repeated by several speakers, is the situation concerning my former colleague, Commissioner Dalli and the tobacco directive. Concerning the resignation of Commissioner Dalli, it was quite clear that, after the Olaf investigation and the discussion of the Olaf report by the President of the Commission and the Commissioner, his position was untenable, especially vis-à-vis the reputation of the European Commission. Therefore, as you know, the process has already started for the appointment of the new Commissioner. I believe, after my initial contacts here in the European Parliament, that we can hold the hearing of the new Commissioner within a couple of weeks and that the new Commissioner could be in office very soon. I have already discussed the plan for the coming weeks with the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We will have a meeting with Mr Harbour in a couple of minutes. What I want to make absolutely sure is that the work which has been started will continue. All the trialogue sessions will continue as planned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the tobacco directive, for the Commission it is absolutely vital that it is this legislator, this Parliament, which will work on the tobacco directive. We want to make absolutely sure that we will present a good proposal upon which I believe this Parliament can reach at least a first reading agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, it would be much more natural if the new Commissioner could start this process from the beginning, through the trialogues, until the end. I was very encouraged by the possible schedule for the appointment of the new Commissioner. I believe that the timescale will be very short, and I can assure you that it is a top priority for the Commission to present the tobacco directive in time for this Parliament to decide upon it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The current crisis, more than any in the past, calls for more resolute leadership at European Union level, too. At the same time, there is no doubt that recession management will fail if it is based on the policies that lead to the crisis in the first place. I welcome the Commission’s work programme for 2013 because, in my view, its component parts represent an innovative shift away from the line adopted in previous years, and because in the interests of promoting economic recovery, it is based on two significant pillars of structural reform: reviving growth and ensuring budgetary discipline. I also welcome the Commission’s position as presented in the document ‘Towards a job-rich recovery. I am delighted that the changes in sectoral policy introduced with a view to creating jobs appear to be having the desired effect. I support the efforts of the Commission to improve governance mechanisms, notably the partnership principle that is to be applied to the drafting, implementation and evaluation of national reform programmes. In line with the European principle of solidarity, I welcome the Commission’s intention that this proposal should help prevent the Council from being able to impede the functioning of the EU Solidarity Fund, which provides assistance to Member States to deal with unforeseen disasters. I would like to highlight another observation based on a similar concept, namely that we need to bear in mind the subsidiarity principle when reallocating unused Structural Funds to the new growth measures and involve local and regional governments. I support the Commission’s work programme and hope that it will be implemented resolutely and successfully.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have one specific and highly critical point to make about the Commission’s work programme for 2013. There is nothing – absolutely nothing – in the Commission’s proposals about health and safety at work. It seems that alongside its regulatory agenda for the financial market – which, of course, I greatly welcome – it is operating a ‘deregulatory agenda’ for our companies and the business environment in which they operate. My fear is that this will lead to the systematic erosion of the basic minimum standards in place in the European Union. On the pretext that it wishes to improve the business environment for all of Europe’s companies (and with SMEs accounting for 98 % of companies in the EU, I think we can safely say that this refers to all of them) and stimulate the economy and industry in Europe, the EU’s existing acquis is weakened. This is especially noticeable, in my view, in relation to workers’ rights of codetermination; it is also apparent in relation to health standards and safety at work. The European social dialogue is put under massive pressure.</p>

    <intervention id="2-254-000" speaker_id="96789" name="Joanna Senyszyn" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="pl">In spite of Parliament’s repeated calls to that effect, the Commission has failed to put forward a comprehensive strategy for combating violence against women. I therefore urge the Commission in 2013, the European Year of Citizens, to publish such a strategy in the form of a directive on violence against women. The same goes for equal pay for women and men. In a resolution adopted on 13 March 2012, Parliament called on the Commission to present a proposal reviewing current legislation implementing the principle of equal pay. We expect the Commission to put forward such a proposal in 2013. It is also necessary to resume work on the directive on non-discrimination. At a time of crisis, the European Union must take care of all its citizens. I am therefore calling on the Commission to make a determined effort to continue its work in this area and on the Member States to adopt the proposed directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the Commission’s activities as regards boosting youth employment. The situation is critical. The average unemployment rate for young people in the EU is now more than 22 %, with 50 % of young people unemployed in some Member States. As a Parliament, we expect the Commission, as part of the umbrella communication on the employment package, to put forward clear targets and timetables, along with legislative proposals concerning youth mobility. The communication should also contain provisions relating to the ‘Youth Guarantee’, the quality framework for internships, language skills and youth entrepreneurship.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The credibility of the Commission’s work programme is linked to the credibility and morality of its mode of operation. These were the topics discussed in the Dalli case. Fighting corruption is a priority. When corruption is sanctioned outside the law, fighting it becomes an act of corruption in itself. The European Anti-Fraud Office has not found any direct evidence to prove that Commissioner Dalli is guilty. Nor has it indicated any legal text that has been contravened. Circumstantial evidence alone cannot overturn the presumption of innocence. The procedure followed by the Commission in the case of Mr Dalli leaves a stain on his reputation in every sense. If Mr Dalli is innocent, the sacrifice of an innocent Member would e a shame. If he is guilty, the Commission’s attempt to hide behind his ‘voluntary’ resignation, and the guilt of not having prevented the irregularities or sanctioned them promptly, would an act of cowardice and irresponsibility. To ask an innocent person to resign is an aberration. What then can you ask of a guilty one? To ask for proof of innocence goes against the principles of law. What is certain is that his resignation delays the adoption of the Tobacco Products Directive, to the delight of those who are opposed to it. Slander is cheaper than a bribe. Therefore, I wonder, who is the corrupt party: Mr Dalli or the European Commission ?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0289/2012) by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (CAA) [12428/2012 – C7-0205/2012 – 2009/0155(NLE)]</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-258-000" speaker_id="96930" name="Vital Moreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur for this procedure, but this is not my report, given that I voted against it in the Committee on International Trade, which I do in fact chair. Having made this statement, I will summarise the various issues involved with as much objectivity as possible. The fundamental issue is whether we should approve the trade agreement with Israel on the mutual recognition of the conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products, which this Protocol already applies to pharmaceutical products, but which will be extended to all other products subject to conformity assessment and acceptance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Committee on International Trade was divided between two irreconcilable camps. The first camp opposed approval on the basis of ensuring consistency in the Union’s external policies with regard to Israel. This camp argued that it does not make sense, on the one hand, to strongly condemn Israel’s policy in the Occupied Territories but, on the other hand, to reinforce trade relations with Israel. It does not make sense to witness the contempt with which Israel defies our condemnation and then give Israel this valuable prize in terms of trade policy. It does not make sense for us to be shocked at the deliberate policy of destroying the conditions for a solution for the two States, as advocated by the Union, and then rehabilitate and encourage Israel in relation to these very same policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second camp in the Committee on International Trade argued that, first, the Protocol is limited to confirming the trade mechanism already set out in the Association Agreement and, second, we should not confuse external policy with foreign trade policy. It was this camp that won in committee, contrary to my draft report, albeit with a small majority. It is now for the plenary and each of us individually to finally decide this fundamental issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition to this fundamental issue, there are two further issues. The first concerns the territorial scope of application of the Protocol. Unfortunately, the Protocol was not carefully negotiated and is unclear as to whether or not it excludes products originating from the Occupied Territories. This point must be clarified, otherwise we risk crossing one of the European Union’s red lines, namely non-recognition of the Israeli integration of these territories. The proposal to ask the Council for an interpretative statement on this issue is therefore justified. Only the Council can make this statement, as it is the Council, on behalf of the Union, which will be bound by this Protocol. Our role here is simply to consent to the Council decision. As a result, we can only ask the Council to do this. Yet without the Council’s clear commitment, here and now, to make this interpretative statement (and, in this respect, I do not see the Council here), our vote on this issue is irrelevant and ineffective. However, we must vote on this interpretative statement, or this request for an interpretative vote.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The third issue is connected with Article 3 of the draft decision of the Council, which concluded the Protocol on behalf of the Union. In that article, the Council authorises the Commission to amend the Protocol, including with regard to beneficiary products, without any subsequent approval by Parliament or the Council. This represents authorisation to amend an international protocol, on which we are now voting. However, the Council still wants to keep control over these amendments through an ad hoc committee, whereas Parliament will from now on have no role in the amendment of the Protocol on which we are now voting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This poses three problems. First, does it make sense to authorise the Commission to amend a trade agreement so substantively? Second, what is the legal basis in the Treaty for the ad hoc committee proposed by the Council to monitor the Commission in this respect. Three, and with this I will conclude, is it acceptable for Parliament to be ignored in the delegation of power, in the control of the exercise of delegated power, and in the assessment of amendments to the Protocol that the Commission will negotiate with Israel? The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has already said that it will ask for this procedure to be referred back to committee so that this issue can be considered. This is an important issue and, in my opinion, we cannot allow a precedent to be created in this respect.</p>

    <intervention id="2-259-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Karel De Gucht" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank you and my colleagues for the opportunity to say a few words regarding the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance, the so-called ACAA between Israel and the EU, which is a fiercely debated issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by recalling what an ACAA is about. Its objective is to eliminate barriers to trade, by allowing products covered by the agreement to enter the markets of the parties without additional conformity assessment procedures. So we are basically talking about mutual recognition of conformity assessment and inspection, results which will reduce costs and time for economic operators.</p>
      <p sl="en">ACAA is a Protocol to the EU-Israel Association Agreement and its scope of application is therefore the same as set out in Article 83 of the Association Agreement. As follows from the international obligations of the EU and as confirmed by the European Court of Justice in the Brita case, the EU does not recognise Israeli jurisdiction over the territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967. Rest assured that the Commission will observe this position in the implementation of the ACAA.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, when the agreement enters into force, the Commission will have to acknowledge under Article 9 of the ACAA the responsible Israeli authority which will have to deliver conformity certificates. This acknowledgement will not entail any recognition of Israeli jurisdiction over territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967. You can also rest assured that, upon receipt of the Israeli notification of its Responsible Authority, the Commission will expressly state that acknowledgement is granted only on the basis that the territory covered by the Responsible Authority does not include the territories brought under Israeli administration in 1967.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of this, Palestinian products cannot be discriminated against in the certification process in Israel because Israel will have to apply the EU acquis. Like any EU Member State, Israel must carry out inspections irrespective of the origin of the product, when a request is received. If there were to be cases of discrimination, the Palestinian manufacturer could lodge a complaint with the Israeli judicial authorities. Of course, the Commission could also use existing means under the Association Agreement to ensure that Israel implements the ACAA.</p>
      <p sl="en">There could be a link between the certification process and the origin of the products in a situation where the Israeli Responsible Authority goes into the Occupied Territories in order to certify products made in the settlements. And we need to be aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to react to recent concerns about Parliament’s role in the context of procedures to amend this ACAA, including by adding annexes for other industrial products in future. The matter seems to be in line with the Lisbon Treaty. Moreover, the Commission will also abide by its obligations under the Framework Agreement to keep Parliament fully informed before approving modifications to an agreement under Article 218(7) of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, we have other ACAAs in the pipeline with other countries where we would expect to face similar, though not identical, concerns. Our experience with the present consent procedure will serve as a useful guide.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in our opinion, the proposed Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) has three major problems today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is institutional. It is still shocking to learn that once the European Parliament’s agreement has been secured for the pharmaceutical sector, Parliament will have no further say in the matter for other sectors that Israel may include. For us, that is like buying a pig in a poke or, if you prefer, taking the European Parliament for a fool.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will continue to fight for Parliament’s prerogatives to be respected. That is why, to clarify this point, my group has asked for this report to be referred back to committee in order to obtain some guarantees on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second problem is legal and relates to the competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority with regard to products from the settlements, settlements that are illegal under international law. We have presented an interpretative statement that covers this aspect. You just raised this point, Mr De Gucht, but that declaration is just wishful thinking unless it is endorsed by the three institutions, and the Council in particular, and to date we have had no guarantees on that point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third problem is political and it is not the least of them. This agreement, which was part of the proposal to upgrade relations with Israel that was frozen in 2008, even though legally it could be concluded in the current framework, is a de facto upgrade. However, nothing has changed on the ground since 2008; if anything, things are worse. The blockade of the Gaza Strip continues, the settlements have expanded dramatically, in violation of international law, and the peace talks have come to a halt. The Lieberman Plan presented in August to the EU High Representative, Baroness Ashton, which proposes Palestinian districts around the Israeli cities, shatters any hope of a two-state solution. Indeed, just a few days ago, Benjamin Netanyahu tried to push through part of the Levy Report, which would legalise the settlements that the Israeli themselves previously deemed illegal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is not our position. Nor is it the position under international law. Do we therefore want to reward this position of Mr Netanyahu’s Government with the ACAA? That is unacceptable, at least for socialists and democrats; unacceptable in relation to our values and unacceptable in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Neighbourhood Policy, which is based on ‘more for more’. On that basis, if the report is not referred back to committee today, our Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will vote against the ACAA.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the PPE Group is in favour of the ACAA and we look forward to the vote in order to give our consent to this important agreement between the EU and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">After a deliberation of more than two and a half years, we are finally having this discussion in the plenary session on ACAA. I am happy that there has been enough common sense among our colleagues in the INTA Committee to vote in favour of this agreement, which is good for both the EU and Israel and is part of the EU Association Agreement. Israel is the first country in the Mediterranean Region to achieve the basic conditions that enable it to reach an ACAA with the EU. The ACAA, together with the additional protocol on pharmaceutical products, aims at facilitating market access by eliminating technical barriers to trade in industrial products.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to make the framework of the ACAA operational, it has to be implemented into specific sectors, practices and regulations. As we know, once adopted, the ACAA would cover mutual recognition of regulatory and verification procedures for pharmaceutical products in the EU and Israel. Such mutual recognition would certainly benefit European consumers and they would get quicker access to Israeli pharmaceutical products, as there would no longer be a need for a second testing in the EU – something that normally takes from one to three years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, it should be mentioned that it took Israel more than six years to adopt the necessary standards in the field of good manufacturing practice for pharmaceutical products. In other words, in order to conclude this agreement, and the additional protocol, Israel had to substantially approximate its regulatory framework on pharmaceutical products to that of the EU. So we are spreading our acquis communautaire to Israel, with a spill-over effect to other areas as well. In other words, it is in the EU’s interest to get Israel’s legislation and standards closer to the EU’s. I would, therefore, like to encourage my colleagues to give our consent to the ACAA later today.</p>

      <p sl="en">blue-card question. – Madam President, my question is a very simple one. Article 2 of the Association Agreement to which this protocol is an additional arrangement says ‘relations between the two parties are based on respect for human rights’. Does the House believe that Israel is respecting the human rights of Palestinians – stealing their lands, expelling them from their homes, preventing them from free circulation in their own land? Is this respect for human rights? Does the House feel that the conditions for an Association Agreement are being fulfilled by Israel?</p>

Human rights are very important, but this agreement we are discussing today is purely technical in nature. It is part of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement must indeed be scrutinised very carefully for it has major political implications. In Israel, there is a debate under way as to whether, with this agreement, we mean to support Israel or show it the red card. In my view, this is an unproductive debate. It is not for us to adopt a position on the State of Israel and its people. Our task is simply to adopt a position towards the present Israeli Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we conclude agreements with other countries, it is only right and proper that we apply the standards and values that we uphold in the European Union to our partner countries as well. With that in mind, it must be said that the present Israeli Government, in its conduct towards the Occupied Territories and the people who live there, is not acting in accordance with the values to which the European Union is committed. That is why we cannot enter into an agreement with that government without giving the matter careful thought.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there is still a lack of clarity on a number of points. The previous speaker said that there was a consensus here. No, there is no consensus. The vote in committee was 13 to 15. In my view, the origin of generic drugs is an issue that must be clarified in future in order to ensure that they do not come from the Occupied Territories or from illegal settlements. We must also clarify how the Commission will in future exercise the right to extend this agreement to other products as well. That is why we need more time for a thorough-going discussion and why I fully support Véronique De Keyser’s demand for this matter to referred back to committee for intensive deliberation.</p>

This Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) was referred to Parliament two years ago, together with an agreement on agricultural products with the Palestinian territories. The first of these agreements is being discussed here today; the second was adopted by this House with no problems at all. Let me ask you this: why is it different when the Israelis do what we regard as the wrong thing? What about the Palestinians? Do you think that Hamas’ practice of executing people or torturing them in cases of doubt is compatible with our human rights standards? Why did we adopt the first agreement with no problems at all eighteen months ago, and why are you now coming up with all kinds of arguments which, strangely, were apparently irrelevant then?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, human rights are essential for this Parliament and for the EU. This is the essence of our values and is also reflected in our trade policies, where we find conditionalities for respect for human rights in relation to all countries across the world with which we have trade relations. This also applies to Israel in the context of the Association Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The vote today concerns the Protocol that stems from that Association Agreement and deals with the pharmaceuticals sector, and with technical requirements and mutual recognition of quality standards. As such, it should be seen as a technical dossier. But, of course, MEPs on both the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on International Trade believed it was important to seek legal guarantees, because we do not want to, directly or indirectly, allow the territorial jurisdiction of Israeli authorities over the Occupied Territories. Nor do we want to allow products from the settlements to enter the EU market. We sought legal certainty and we believe that we have acquired the requisite assurances now.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also, as Members of this Parliament, attach a statement where we reiterate how important we think it is that Israel respect human rights. This is not only important for us and for the Palestinian people but, most of all, for Israel’s future. The Israeli Government is actually on a path to self-isolation which is not working, making bold statements that the EU should solve its own problems before addressing others.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, it is important that the EU show its strength and its muscle, and this Protocol does not provide a very effective tool for that purpose. If we want to address human rights violations in Israel – and I think we should – we should do so on the basis of the conditionalities provided for under the Association Agreement.</p>

How can it seriously be described as a technical agreement? It was a Commission report in 2009 that said that the ACAA’s entry into force would mark the first step in Israel’s integration into the EU single market.

When revolutions happen in Arab countries, we hear people say: ‘we must organise free trade agreements with the Arab countries because that is how we can support the emergence of democracy in the Arab countries’. All of a sudden, trade becomes a purely technical, and highly complicated, issue that has no connection with politics.

What we are doing here is sending a message to Israel: ‘you must vote for Mr Netanyahu so that he continues his settlement policy, his policy of infringing human rights’.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is unfortunately too much politicking sometimes over trade issues, not only in the INTA Committee, but in this House as well. So let me just repeat once again that those who say that this is mostly a technical framework agreement are right; it is. It aims purely at facilitating the elimination of technical barriers to trade; also, it is something that should be judged on its trade merits alone. It is simply a protocol to an existing agreement between the EU and Israel. I do not need to stress how beneficial it could be to the EU; it would significantly reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products imported into the EU, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the EU has already concluded and agreed a similar agreement with the Palestinian Authority. It has been a number of months since it was concluded and agreed, and it would be quite hypocritical of the EU side to reject the agreement.</p>

I have to add that it was made clear that no products originating from the so-called Occupied Territories will be accepted.

This time by attacking a ship, the MV Estelle, carrying thirty activists from Europe, including many European MPs, hijacking their ship, tasering and beating up to 14 of these activists, and now 14 people are still in prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why did this wonderful European-like, model democracy country that Mr Zahradil would have us believe is the State of Israel, do this? It was because these people were simply trying to bring humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, thereby breaking the illegal blockade imposed on the almost two million people in Gaza, who are forced to live in what is in effect an open air prison camp. I have been on a similar ship; I have been attacked by the Israeli military; I have spent a week in Israeli prisons in inhumane conditions, and I have been to Gaza and seen the reality of the conditions that are imposed on the people of Gaza by the choices made by the right-wing Israeli Government. I have seen the hospitals that do not have even basic medicines. I have seen the mass poverty – up to 80 % of people rely on humanitarian aid to survive – and now the European Commission and the right wing in this Parliament would like us to pat Israel on the back, to congratulate it, to welcome it into the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us drop the pretence that this is a technical agreement: that is absolute rubbish. It is completely disingenuous to suggest that. Entry into the single market is not a technical question.

If this Parliament agrees to give consent, it will be a continuation of a two-faced EU policy which on the one hand speaks about the rights of the Palestinians, gives out about the oppression of the Palestinians and verbally gives support to a Palestinian State, but in reality backs up the actions of Israel and the oppression of the Israeli State against the Palestinians.</p>

However, as indicated by the Commissioner, this has been dealt with in the conditionalities in the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel.</p>

By allowing mutual recognition of goods certificates, the EU-Israel ACAA would erode several barriers to exporting pharmaceuticals from Israel to the EU and vice versa, allowing advanced medical supplies to reach those who need them most, in a reduced timeframe. In the light of the global economic climate, eliminating the need for extensive product testing would also positively impact the operating costs of EU pharmaceutical manufacturers, leading to savings in national health care services, including the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.

What manner of policy-making is this, however, when we as the House briefly outline our thoughts about a document, the groups then go away and work on the text, and then we demand a statement from the Council without ever engaging with it on this issue? It is a style of policy-making that we cannot support, and that is why we are voting against this amendment.</p>
      <p sl="de">My next point is this. We would also question whether this amendment is admissible under Rule 81. I would be most grateful to the President if she could clarify that particular point.</p>
      <p sl="de">What annoys me – and has been evident several times today – is this: as the European Union, we are one of a very small number of recognised mediators in this conflict. In that particular context, it is important to show that we are not giving preferential treatment to, or discriminating against, one side or the other. If we want to continue to be recognised as a mediator, we must deal fairly with both sides. Eighteen months ago, we allowed the agreement with the Palestinian territories to pass through this House in its entirety, despite Hamas and despite the use of the death penalty. With this agreement today, however, very different standards are being applied. I just wish that we could all abide by our principles.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, I have the impression that for some Members of this House, the only principle worth upholding is to have no principles at all. They prefer to twist and turn the issues as it suits them. That is not a credible way to do politics. I would ask you, therefore, to rethink your position and to vote for this agreement this evening, just as you voted for the agreement with the Palestinian territories, for the substance of the agreement is the same.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Daniel Caspary knows full well that he is not equating like with like. Firstly, the Palestinians are the occupied, not the occupiers. Secondly, the agricultural upgrade was relatively minor compared to the millions, if not billions, that could eventually be available to Israeli companies if we approve this so-called ‘technical upgrade’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not a ‘technical upgrade’. It will immediately benefit Israeli pharmaceutical companies. It is also not something being done in the interest of the European Union, Mrs Dodds, because there is no evidence that it would save the UK National Health Service a single penny. This is not the time, in my opinion, to be upgrading our relationship with Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we believe in policy cohesion, we have to have some interaction between our trade policy, our human rights policy and our foreign policy. Mr Murphy has rightly said that Israel is engaged in the collective punishment of Gaza, against all human rights norms, against all international norms. There is no question about it; even the Israelis do not deny it. For the misdemeanours of a few, the whole of Gaza is being punished.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also know, of course, that Israel has continued to expand its settlements in the Middle East. These settlements are illegal under international law and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible. The EU has repeatedly urged the Israeli Government to immediately end all settlement activities on the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, in line with its obligations under the roadmap. These are not my words, but those of the High Representative of the European Union. So how can the High Representative put out a press release like that, and the Trade Commissioner then come along and say we should approve the rewarding of Israel for its policies?</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no cohesion there, there is no logic to such a position in the European Union. Let me make it clear, and other speakers have made it clear: this is not about being anti-Israel. This is about being anti the current Israeli Government and anti the current Israeli Government’s policies. That is why initially I hoped to postpone a decision, so that if we do get a better Israeli Government, if we do get better Israeli policies, we could pass this protocol and we could enhance our relationship with Israel.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in itself the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is an excellent piece of work. It focuses on simplification, which is certainly desirable, but, to be frank, it would be naive to consider it a technical agreement. There is a long list of requests to the Israeli authorities from the European Union, from the High Representative, from our consulates in East Jerusalem, and from this Parliament on the settlements in the West Bank, on the continuing annexation of East Jerusalem, on the situation in Gaza and on the resumption of the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we look at what the EU has obtained with these requests, we see neither real progress nor any serious concessions. I therefore consider this to be anything but a politically neutral measure. My delegation will vote against the ACAA and I am calling on the Commission, should the ACAA be approved, to exercise the highest possible degree of oversight, both in terms of traceability of products to the Occupied Territories, which is a problem that has nothing to do with the good faith of the Commission but rather with Israel, and extension of the agreement to other products without the involvement of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is interesting that we are having this vote right after the Israeli Foreign Minister insulted our High Representative Baroness Ashton and the EU on Saturday, saying that the EU should focus on its own problems before making suggestions on how to resolve the crisis and the terrible situation with Palestine. This is clearly mocking the fact that the EU has taken a stance on this issue, and its involvement in the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I think you have been trying to work on the question of the settlement products, but this is not the only thing that will help us out. The question we are dealing with in this Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is a territorial question: who decides the boundaries of Israel and our trade relations – Israel according to its own law, or the EU according to international law?</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Foreign Affairs Committee, we had asked for an interim report to clarify the legal questions. It is true, Mr Caspary, that the INTA chair at first decided not to go for that approach. We were quite sad to hear that, but it is interesting that we are now returning to that option. I consider that option is still the best one we can take – to clarify the legal questions and get an interim report that clarifies the outstanding issues. It is our task as parliamentarians to check the legal validity. This is not only a legal question but a political one also.</p>

      <p sl="it">The agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products provides for the extension of some of the benefits of the internal market to sectors that are already aligned but that require further standardisation in order to facilitate access to the market for industrial products and remove technical barriers. The agreement is of a commercial nature, because it allows easier European access to markets for pharmaceutical products and completion of the current policy of exchange between the EU and the Mediterranean countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Any debate on doubts regarding the origins of certain products exported should be commercially based, and we would not have such doubts had the Council approved the Regulation on indications of origin, which has instead been held up and in fact risks being shelved due to lack of political understanding and opposing interests. I call on the House to attempt to distinguish between the commercial and political assessments, to avoid sterile manipulation of these issues and to vote in favour of the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, today we are discussing the CAA Agreement, an agreement which, if approved, will give access, on European markets, to Israeli products which may be produced in Palestinian territories occupied by Israel. Such a development would be contrary to the laws of the European Union and international law, since it would force the European Union to recognise the extension of Israel’s sovereignty beyond the territories which it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank settlement. It would also be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Europe-Israel association, which clearly envisages the dedication of the parties to respect for human rights, an obligation which Israel signally fails to fulfil in the long term. Israel proved this beyond doubt last Saturday, when, as Mr Murphy has said, it forcibly blocked the ship ‘Estelle’ on its course in international waters. It is proving it today with its continued occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union has a duty to protect the human rights of a people who are under occupation, not to upgrade its relations with the occupying state. If the Council and the Commission do not respect this fundamental principle, let us do so ourselves, as the European Parliament, by voting against the protocol.</p>

      <p sl="nl">With respect to certification and standardisation, it is completely on an equal footing with Western countries. For that reason alone, this protocol is of course hugely important for the EU. It will bring the vast potential of high-end products from Israel within the reach of European citizens. It is no mere chance that all of the computers in the world have some Israeli component in them and keeping in touch online would never have happened without the Israeli computer industry.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another reason to strengthen trade relations with the Jewish state of Israel is, of course, its unrelenting struggle against terrorism from the Gaza Strip and terrorism in Israel itself.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ACAA agreement is not an upgrading of relations between the EU and Israel. It is based on the alignment of the legislative system of a country and its infrastructure with the EU. It is a process emanating from the Barcelona Process, extended now to Neighbourhood Policy countries, as stipulated in the association agreements; and it is a process that will apply to all partners as soon as the conformity assessment is completed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main purpose of the Union for the Mediterranean, formerly known as the Barcelona Process, is not to deal with, judge or attempt to resolve the partners’ political issues, such as the Middle East problem. Its purpose is to create, through the association agreements and cooperation between partners, an environment of trust, détente and understanding within which the parties to a dispute can try to resolve their differences themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would therefore be inappropriate to introduce political considerations in giving our assent once our question, addressed to the Commissioner and agreed by all, has been answered: this agreement applies only to Israel within its 1967 borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU, a soft power, should exercise its influence in the Middle East, avoiding what would appear as sanctions – which we know in advance will not work with Israel, which has enough backing from the United States – through which we ourselves create a void.

      <p sl="en">I believe that support for ACAA at this point in time runs contrary to all recent EU policy statements, including the conclusions by the European Council of 14 May, recent statements by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, and, indeed, resolutions by this Parliament. All of these have been strong in their admonishment of Israeli policies in relation to settlements, the Gaza blockade and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in the region, the evictions of Palestinians from their lands, the demolition of homes and vital infrastructure, the restrictions on freedom of movement, the isolation of East Jerusalem and the lack of progress on the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has expressed the view time and time again that the actions by the Israelis threaten to make the two-state solution impossible. If we are to achieve a lasting solution, there must be consequences for Israel for the flagrant breaches of international law. While I accept that approval for ACAA is not technically an upgrading, given that it is based on an existing Association Agreement, in practice it does allow access for Israeli pharmaceuticals to one of the most lucrative markets in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Enhancing the EU’s partnership with Israel at this time serves only to undermine our own EU’s firm condemnation of Israeli policy. Our words must be followed up with actions if they are to have any real meaning or effect.

Above all, it is particularly outrageous that those who wish to admonish Israel are the same people who fail to recognise the oppression of human rights in Cuba, who are able to applaud Fidel Castro, who do not see the problem in Venezuela, who, ultimately, do not see any problem with human rights in Belarus.

This is a technical agreement that will allow many European citizens easier access to quality medicinal products at a lower price, with considerable savings for our national health services.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments. The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course. However, under Israel’s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory. Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well. When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel’s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories.

      <p sl="it">Having said that, however, we must also strongly condemn the repeated violations of international law and of the agreements signed by the Israeli Government, which have led to a downward spiral that Israel should – precisely because it claims to be the only democracy in the Middle East – make a definite effort to end.</p>

Look where that led. Some people want to express a slightly similar thought, namely that trade with Israel should cease, even though this is a technical agreement that will benefit all Europeans. I therefore hope that we will clearly vote in favour of the ACAA today.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we are dealing here with a Protocol connected with Euro Mediterranean cooperation between the European Communities and Israel. This is certainly not a directly political case. Some, of course, maintain in Parliament that this constitutes the first upgrade of relations with Israel and hence may influence the dispute.</p>
      <p sl="el">As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I, too, worked with my colleagues to deal with the problems which would arise in areas which have been occupied by Israel and which are not recognised by the European Union, in other words the post-1967 territories, and we submitted a question to Commissioner De Gucht through Mr Brok, and Commissioner De Gucht came here and made it clear that one party may very well impose terms upon the other, via the Protocol, whereby it does not recognise products that come from certain areas. Therefore the technical issue has essentially been solved.</p>
      <p sl="el">The conflict between Israel and Palestine, Mr President, is something much deeper; it is not something that will be affected by this particular agreement, which of course concerns products which are of a high quality and are offered at very good prices by Israel.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is naïve to believe that such an agreement can have anything to do with the essence of resolving the issue. The issue is much more complex and all of us here know the responsibilities that exist more generally, and the problems that hinder resolution of the issue, and of course we are aware of the European Union’s efforts to give full support to the Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, we have no reason to link it with settlement of the problem. Besides, the two amendments do not legally exist, and therefore must have been dismissed.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Agreement between the European Union and Israel on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is mutually beneficial, but raises two issues of a legal nature. The first is the territorial expansion of the Israeli Responsible Authority: to respect European and international law, we must ensure that Israel differentiates between its own territory and the territories it occupies. The second relates to the various products that can be added to this agreement, unfortunately without the consent of the European Parliament. Pharmaceutical products will be followed by cosmetic ones, in a scenario in which Parliament will be deprived of its right as a co-legislator. The duty of the Union’s democratic forum is to draw attention to these legal loopholes and to vote responsibly, offering the European Commission the chance to clarify these problematic aspects of its proposal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, I believe that this report should be referred back to the committee responsible and that we should adopt the declaration proposing the correct delimitation of the territorial expansion of the Israeli Responsible Authority. I hope that these matters will be examined in full by the Council and the Commission, regardless of the outcome of tonight’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I believe the best speech this afternoon has been by Mr Kasoulides, who cited the Barcelona Process and neighbourhood policy. I fervently believe that the EU’s role in promoting trade as a basis of dialogue and prosperity and its role in keeping its partners to democratic and human rights standards are part of a package, not one set against the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is precisely the story of the EU itself, for which it received the Nobel Peace Prize. We can press our partners close on trade and on human rights at the same time. I voted for the agreement on agricultural trade with Palestine last year, despite some shocking reports – particularly on Hamas abuses in Gaza – most recently by Human Rights Watch and the Carnegie Endowment, because I believe in strengthening EU trade and economic links with the whole region.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this whole approach of critics, which sees trade relations with parties as a zero-sum game, is hopelessly unproductive. As my colleague Marietje Schaake said, exactly how would rejection of this ACAA Agreement actually improve the situation of Palestinians? This is not about patting Israel on the back or rewarding it. It is not a political upgrade. It is part of the steady development of a neighbourhood policy of engagement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are talking about an agreement between the European Union and Israel that will improve access in the EU to generic medicines from Israel. Their prices may fall as a result, benefiting EU citizens. Nevertheless, this agreement has been questioned in this Chamber, not on technical or substantive grounds but on political grounds. It has been criticised in an attempt to make it a hostage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I, personally, have been very critical and, in many cases, taken a very negative view of Israel’s policy towards the Occupied Territories; however, I am in favour of this agreement for the following reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, the agreement concerns Israel within its recognised borders, which is the World Trade Organisation standard and is clear to all. There are instruments in place to ensure that incorrectly labelled products are detected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the blocking of this agreement would amount to the imposition of sanctions, sanctions that Parliament is not empowered to establish or initiate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, it is important to find a solution to the conflict between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, but we should actually be doing something more effective; we should ask the Council and Commission to take more effective action to that end.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, blocking this agreement would send a very negative signal to Israel, especially now, when it is under huge pressure, including from Iran, which is on the brink of reaching nuclear weapons capability.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am therefore opposed to the amendments that have been tabled and in favour of the agreement, which is beneficial to the European Union, while also supporting increased mediation by the EU in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, you would think, from listening to this debate, that this Chamber were divided into those who support peace and those who are opposed to peace in the Middle East; into those who spread violence and those who are against it. That is, however, a false dichotomy; we all want the same thing for the Middle East. I respect the fact that there are people in this Chamber who are against the Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) Protocol, but I would like them to set aside hypocrisy and to cease their talk of the origin of products. Today we have the ability to check where a particular orange was grown, and are we not capable of establishing where medicines were produced? These people should stop the hypocrisy; it is fine for them simply to say that they are against the protocol.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the protocol and I shall tell you why: if a dose of medicine costs PLN 40, or EUR 10, in Poland today, it could be 10 % cheaper. A poor person in Poland could spend PLN 4 less on the same medicine and, with that PLN 4, buy some lunch instead. Today, those who are against this very agreement need to tell that poor person directly: I am against it and I refuse you that one additional lunch. That is a boundary of hypocrisy that should not be crossed, even in politics.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have one more thing to say: I have heard it said that the Israeli Government is no good. That may be true, but I was speaking recently to the leader of the Israeli Labour Party, which is in opposition, and he wholeheartedly supports this agreement, because it furthers cooperation in the interests of a forward-looking Israel, an Israel to which those who love peace also belong.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Siwiec. I would hope that the whole Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament could speak in the same emphatic way in relation to this matter, because this Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) concerning trade in pharmaceuticals is indeed about the reciprocal approval of technical regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is a requirement for concluding the agreement that the partner country, in this case Israel, has transposed the EU’s rules into its own national legislation, and of course it would be lovely for a country outside the EU to follow the same rules. In practice, as many people have said here, this means that there would be no need for a separate approval procedure that adds time and costs, and so it is consumers, European consumers, who will be the winners here.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The total economic impact on the EU will be positive; the value of trade between the EU and Israel in products falling within the scope of this agreement has been nearly EUR 1 billion, so recognition of certification will entail savings and promote exports. There will also be benefits that cannot even be measured quantitatively, like the fact that predictability for businesses may improve, systems will come to be standardised, and there may also be a reduction in protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Some assessments have been presented here according to which the agreement could be interpreted as an upgrade in relations between the EU and Israel or as a reinforcement of relations in a situation where the Middle East peace process has stalled. It is worth remembering that the peace process needs two sides, and the Palestinian side has not been willing to come to the table. It should also be remembered that the negotiations on the ACAA form part of the EU-Israel action plan already agreed within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I personally would hope that we could engage in more and more cooperation between the EU and Israel in even more areas, since it really would benefit both sides. I appeal to my colleagues to vote in favour of this agreement today.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an additional protocol on bilateral cooperation between the European Union and Israel is mutually beneficial and extremely important. It will improve access to cheap, generic medicines, eliminating technical restrictions. Israel’s medicines are among the best in the world, and many medical establishments use them, including most European health care bodies. The Protocol will speed up the long certification procedure, reducing costs and improving access to drugs, making it possible for patients to pay less. This, particularly in the current crisis, is very important to each of our citizens. The highest level of drug quality control will be retained, as demanded by European regulatory bodies.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The Protocol also covers opportunities to export European drug products to Israel. At a time when we are talking about support for innovation, this would ensure real support for the largest innovation sector, pharmaceuticals. Thus it would lead to jobs and growth, too. The Protocol would also serve as a first step in other sectors of industry, in order to harmonise European and Israeli legislation. By bringing in a common certification system, we could reduce the cost of importing generic drugs by as much as EUR 10 billion per year, and the new certification procedures will ensure that only Israeli companies that are registered and approved by the European Union will be able to produce drugs for export. Thus only the best tested drugs will reach the European market. Businesses, which will be subject to the one-off certification procedure, will reduce production time to as little as three years. The economic gain from the Protocol is obvious. There is another gain: support for a democratic regime in this region torn apart by conflict and violence. I can only agree with Mr Caspary that if we conclude an agreement with Palestine, then we should do the same with Israel. I call upon my fellow Members to support the adoption of the Protocol without delay. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it would be interesting to compare a debate like this one on the trade agreement with Israel to debates that have been held on other trade agreements all over the world. It has been said that this would be some sort of gift or reward for Benjamin Netanyahu. After all, it is a good thing to reject the EU’s own capacity to engage in trade, and it is a remarkable way of thinking, is it not?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Of course we know that today, here in this Europe of ours, unimaginable quantities of medicines originating from Israel are prescribed. They are said to be in the order of 3.5 million per day. We also know that these medicines are cheaper, as has recently been said in this House. After all, it is not completely wrong if the EU can procure something that is cheaper and of the highest quality when it is a matter of fighting type 2 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and reducing blood pressure.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Someone in this Chamber said that we always talk about human rights whenever we talk about China. That is true, although I have not heard anyone say that we should break off trade with China. If that is the case, this should be one of the consequences.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We cannot talk about the Occupied Territories without at the same time daring to say why those territories are occupied and why Israel does not stay behind the 1967 borders. I think it is tremendously simplistic to forget all about that, if we do have to take it up in this debate, which should not be necessary at all but which so very many people have done.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This agreement was, therefore, approved two and a half years ago, and is now being messed about and tinkered with here. It would be right and honest to talk about why it is being tinkered with, because this is absurd. Instead, we are infecting the opportunities for making an impact on the Middle East, and of course people believed that Parliament would not want to do that.</p>

It is wrong to assert that this agreement is about upgrading trade relations between the EU and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The agreement is not about upgraded relations or the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is about facilitating the introduction and approval of new medicines, all so that sick people in Israel and Europe can have access to the best medicine as cheaply and quickly as possible. Stopping this agreement would be tantamount to punishing those whom we should agree are completely blameless in this conflict, namely sick people.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We started this work back in 2010, and at that time we worked in parallel on an agreement with Palestine on fruit and vegetables. In 2011 I voted for approval of the trade agreement with Palestine on fruit and vegetables. We did it in parallel simply because we did not wish to send any political signals to one side or the other. However, the left has stopped the agreement with Israel and only approved the agreement with Palestine. This makes a great political game out of something that should not have been a great political game.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to finish by saying that sick people in Europe should not pay the price for the Left wanting to score political points on something like this that should actually be capable of making people’s lives easier, both in Israel and in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">For the record, and for those who have raised the issue repeatedly, I have received repeated assurances that there are no pharmaceutical products being manufactured in the settlements. Supporting ACAA does not endorse the expansion of settlements or indeed any other Israeli policy, neither does it increase goods with a provenance from the Occupied Territories. It does, however, enable Israel, which has a highly sophisticated regulatory authority, to certify medical products, a task for which it is more than equipped, to the benefit of all of Europe’s citizens.</p>

I was not the original rapporteur for this procedure, but became the rapporteur unwillingly. All of the decisions in this procedure, and in fact the procedure as a whole, have been handled with the utmost transparency and full agreement of the committee. The accusation made against me by a representative of Israeli interests in this Parliament is not only stupid, but also discredits the person making the accusation. Second, my objection to this proposal and my original position as rapporteur have nothing to do with Israeli policy. They concern us and the consistency that the Treaty requires our external policies to have. My position has always been that it is the consistency of the Union’s external policies which is at stake. I cannot see how it is possible to condemn Israel for what it is doing in relation to the Occupied Territories and then, at the same time, when we have an opportunity to put pressure on Israel to take notice of our condemnations, to give it a prize of this nature. Tomorrow Israel will be laughing like mad at our policy positions, because it knows that they are purely self-serving and hypocritical, and that when it comes to enforcing them, we cannot.</p>

In recent decades Israel has set an example of how to build a modern democracy despite the difficulties facing it in one of the world’s most politically volatile regions. The Jewish state has demonstrated that it is possible to create freedom and peace for people even in an area where dictatorships are being established and hatred fomented. I firmly believe that the European Parliament has an ethical and moral obligation to support any measure that brings Israel and the European Union closer together; in cultural terms, after all, Israel is part of Europe. Israel is the kind of state that also consistently demonstrates its maturity with regard to human rights, and so the European Union should exercise caution before interfering in Israel’s internal affairs.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I shall not use all my speaking time now, but it is possible that I may wish to take the floor again at the end of the debate, if I may, to respond to any questions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">First and foremost, I would like to point out that the aim of this report is to adapt our legislation to the changes that entered into force when Parliament was given the power of codecision on trade matters through the new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is essentially a rather technical question to accelerate the procedure and ensure that we do not delay it for an uncommonly long time. In order to do this, the Commission has stated that we need delegated acts in order both to achieve predictability and to ensure that Parliament does not sit with long lists of products, going through them one at a time. Some of these questions should have been dealt with more quickly by experts in delegated acts; we should now be able to limit these.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The challenge here is that we must deal with this item rather quickly. If we do not, we will have old lists of so-called ‘dual-use items’ that only cover the system changes that have taken place up until 2010. We must deal with the item that we are discussing now rather quickly in order for us to be able to cover all of the changes that took place during 2011.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When we discussed the question in the committee, we unfortunately had a little too much conflict, and quite unnecessarily. A great many views were expressed that did not relate to the technical question of how we should work with delegated acts and achieve faster, more efficient processing, and on that point, I believe the shadow rapporteur and I essentially agree.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many other questions have also been taken up and discussed. I understand from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, among others, that some further amendments will be tabled. This applies, for example, to the proposals on IT security, transparency, etc. I shall merely point out that I agree with several of them and think that several of them are relevant. I shall not, however, take them up here and risk delaying adoption of this document with reference to the amendments that the S&amp;D Group, among others, has tabled.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Of course, we know that there will be a big overhaul of the entire system of dual-use items. The Commission is planning to submit some things in 2013, and there will be a legislative proposal in 2014. I therefore do not see any compelling reasons as to why we must implement the amendments that I know have been put forward by the S&amp;D Group, among others.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I therefore hope that we can now take this technical item and ensure that we facilitate it so that we can then, at a later date, come back to many of the relevant views that my colleagues have had. I now hope that we can deal with this item quickly and efficiently in accordance with the committee’s proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the proposal that we are debating today is about export control of dual-use items and technologies and it therefore, naturally, serves a dual purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, this proposal is about our security. It aims to make the EU more efficient in preventing the risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of the military use of civilian items, while ensuring that we comply with our international commitments in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the proposal is about our prosperity. It will help level the playing field vis-à-vis our competitors and therefore foster our competitiveness by making sure that our export controls do not hamper legitimate trade in critical sectors of our economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the objectives behind the proposal are shared by a large majority of Members of Parliament. It is vital to strike a fair balance between a strong defence of our security and the promotion of our trade concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order for the EU to achieve these objectives, it is proposed to delegate to the Commission the competence to update the so-called ‘EU control list’ – the list of controlled items – in the Regulation governing the European dual-use export control system. Updates of this list should be carried out frequently in order to comply with our international commitments, leading to quasi-automatic transposition of internationally-agreed controls into EU law. Currently, the legislative procedure is too heavy and not suitable for such a frequent and technical task.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me take a recent example: it took the EU more than two years to update the Common Control List. This has been widely criticised by EU economic operators, who sometimes cannot trade in certain goods while their competitors have the freedom to do so, since these products have already been removed from the control lists in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also proposed to empower the Commission to update Annex II of our dual-use export control system, which provides for facilitated controls of certain low-risk items to certain low-risk destinations. This is needed to take account of sometimes rapidly changing circumstances: here again, our security is at stake and the question is how long should it take for the EU to require enhanced controls on exports when the security situation deteriorates in a particular country? In such cases, clearly, time is of the essence and the proposal therefore will accelerate this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have taken note of the different amendments tabled and would like to remind you of an ongoing and wide-ranging review the Commission has launched in relation to our EU export control regime, which offers the appropriate setting to discuss issues that are outside the scope of the proposed Regulation. As I have already explained, the purpose of the proposal we are debating today is simply to introduce a more efficient procedure to revise the EU control list which covers only dual-use items for weapons of mass destruction or military end-use. Thus, we will provide more security and a level playing field for our exporters. That is what is at stake now.</p>

It deals with items that are primarily used for civilian purposes: items which, fundamentally, are civilian in nature, such as computer keyboards, office chairs, and replacement parts for machinery and vehicles, all of which, in essence, are designed for use in non-military contexts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main point of contention between us this evening, notwithstanding the large measure of agreement on this issue, is the question of ex ante or ex post notification of an export. I would ask Members to give some further thought to what this draft regulation actually says. The point at issue in our discussion is this. Provided that the item and the country appear on the relevant lists, an exporter who is subject to this regulation would be legally authorised, under this regulation, to export his product. The only point at issue between us is whether, as a general principle and for statistical reasons, he should be required to provide notification of this export ex post or ex ante. The issue of ex post or ex ante does not relate to whether or not the product may be exported. It can be exported provided that the country and the product appear on the lists. The point is whether, with our export control regime, we are putting European countries at what I would regard as an unnecessary disadvantage in relation to their competitors. So I would ask fellow Members from the other groups to consider whether this is really what we want. In essence, we agree: we must create a more effective export control regime in the EU, and we need to be able to respond more quickly. That is why I fully support the Commission’s proposal. I also endorse the comments made by the rapporteur, namely that the lists must be updated as quickly as possible by the Commission so that we no longer have the untenable situation that we had in the past but instead have effective export controls.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that as soon as dual-use items feature on the agenda, the telephones in the German Economics Ministry light up like Christmas trees. That is when the interventions start, along with the attempts to convince colleagues that they should not be in favour of ex ante controls. In any discussion of this issue, we must be absolutely clear what we are dealing with. We are not talking about office chairs, despite what the previous speaker claims. We are talking about civilian goods which can be used for military purposes. We are talking about dangerous chemicals, and we are also talking about software. Indeed, it was software exported from Europe which, one year ago – and perhaps even now – was used to kill people in the Middle East. It was used in neighbour countries on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean by those who committed human rights abuses and persecuted, tortured and in some cases murdered human rights activists.</p>
      <p sl="de">With that in mind, surely we can discuss once again whether ex ante approval of these exports is possible. Does it really make a difference, in terms of the bureaucratic effort, whether notification takes place beforehand rather than 30 days later? That does not create more red tape, but it does create rather more security. By that, I mean more security for people who might otherwise suffer as a result of the export of these items and suffer simply so that a few European companies can increase their profits. I believe it is important to ensure, in this House, that Europe’s industry can export its products, but we need effective controls and above all, we need ex ante controls. These are the reasons why we Social Democrats are so keen to ensure that we move in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand the Commission’s position and I also understand the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). You want a regime that is swift and problem-free. However, the problems that this will cause are serious enough to outweigh any of the concerns that have been expressed here.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the discussion around dual-use items I would like to focus on technologies. Technologies play an ever more important role in the lives of citizens, empowering the individual, breaking monopolies on information and power, and offering plenty of economic, social, cultural and other opportunities for development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Technologies also impact human rights. People in Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Syria, China, Burma and many other countries, through the use of smart phones and internet access, are able to claim fundamental human rights such as free expression, press freedom, free assembly and access to information, and they can share documented human rights abuses. But those who fear losing control are striking back, increasingly repressing people with the help of technologies as well. Prisons all over the world are populated by dissidents, human rights defenders, journalists and citizens whose laptops, mobile phones, social media and email accounts have been compromised. In their cases, mass surveillance, mass censorship, tracking and tracing are not issues of statistics, Mr Caspary, but of life and death. Too often, the repressive technologies that are used to repress people have a label: ‘made in Europe’.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we do not export technologies that can be used to attack the EU itself. Speed is indeed important, and we must stop the digital arms trade with more transparency and accountability, a level playing field in Europe and more flexibility for updates, so that the EU can play a leading role in an ever-changing world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, dual-use items often look harmless, but in the hands of authoritarian regimes they can be as lethal as machine guns or tanks. We undermine our foreign policy goals if we send surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes which can then use them to monitor and suppress democracy movements. It was European mobile phone software produced by Nokia Siemens Networks which played into the hands of the Iranian security forces as they crushed the Green protest movement. Large numbers of protesters were abducted, imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to death. That is just one of many examples.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, with its Action Plan for an innovative and competitive security industry, as it is called, the Commission is promoting these dubious dual-purpose items. Its stated aim is better exploitation of synergies between security and defence technologies. We are on the verge of selling out: selling out, quite literally, not only human rights but also our security interests in favour of an industrial policy of dubious worth. For that reason, I urge you to vote for the amendments tabled by our Group together with the Social Democrats and the ALDE.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this matter of dual use items keeps on coming up. Its significance is that, in order to export anything on the dual use list, we in the UK need to get permission from the European Commission first. The EU justifies this by asserting that the dual use list prevents weapons falling into the hands of dictators. Given that EU companies sold Colonel Gaddafi the incredible sum of 300 million euros’ worth of arms in just five years, that assertion comes across as being on one level invalid and on another level hypocritical.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be clear: the purpose of this proposal is to give yet more power to the Commission to designate what items should go on the dual use list. The UK is a global trading nation, and we as a nation [I thought it was a minute and half] find it wholly unacceptable that unelected bureaucrats should have the right to regulate Britain’s exporters and even veto hard-won export orders.</p>

This regulation on dual-use items is not about Europe obstructing British exports. It is about ensuring that all our European exporters have the same chances. I know that the United Kingdom is a country that acts very fairly and keeps to the rules. However, there are others in Europe who do not keep to the rules all the time or keep a close eye on what is being exported. This regulation creates equal opportunities for those who respect the law. I believe the Earl of Dartmouth’s country to be one of those countries. That is why I would encourage him not to oppose everything that comes out of Europe on principle, but to look at the issue more closely. European action can benefit the United Kingdom as well, and I believe that is the case here. Do please reconsider and look at exactly what is at stake here.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, dual-use items are goods and technologies that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as computers, electronics and aerospace technology. If goods of this nature are exported, it is important to ensure that they are not put to undesirable military use. On the other hand, it is also important to ensure that legitimate trading activities are not unduly restricted. Due to today’s rapid technological development, it is only right and proper to safeguard the EU’s capacity to react swiftly and effectively. It damages the European economy if third countries can react more swiftly, thus putting themselves in a more advantageous position in global competition. Generally speaking, efficient implementation of the key parameters depends, firstly, on effective communication between Member States’ authorities, secondly, on effective cooperation between control agencies, and thirdly, on stringent sanctions for non-compliance.</p>

      <p sl="it">I also fully support the rapporteur’s wish to have the scope of application of the Decision widened to focus on enhancing the awareness of citizens in order to allow them to make full use of their rights, and not just their right to move and reside freely.

      <p sl="hu">The European Commission has proposed designating 2013 the European Year of Citizens. I am convinced that in spite of the current crisis this will strengthen resolve to ensure that citizens are able to exercise and assert their rights. According to the statistics, one-third of citizens intend to do so, but administrative difficulties and inadequate language knowledge still present barriers to taking up employment when they move abroad to another Member State. The plan for the European Year of Citizens places responsibility for ensuring adequate information in the hands of Member States, but the most effective way to exchange positive experiences will always be at EU level. The objective of our amendments was to broaden the scope of the programme and ensure that citizens have a bigger role in raising awareness regarding their rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As shadow rapporteur, I would like to stress that the Commission has successfully mapped out the demands behind the motto ‘More Europe!’ and listened to the expectations voiced in relation to the European Year of Citizens at EU, Member State, regional and local levels. Delivering on these, however, and running popular communications channels or portals will require an increase in the budget. I was pleased to see that, as today’s vote showed, all of the political groups agreed on this.</p>

It is a way of remembering that all of the other measures we are discussing in these days – the banking union, the economic and financial measures for combating the crisis – have the interests of citizens as their primary objective. The aim of the European Year on which we have voted is to enhance the rights attached to Union citizenship and the role played by the associations in the Union, reinforcing the right of students, teachers, artists and those working creatively to move freely.</p>
      <p sl="it">In short, it aims to strengthen European identity through concrete initiatives in which the citizens play the leading role. This is a real bottom-up approach to building the Union, and the reason why I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The attitudes of citizens towards the EU have cooled, thanks to the financial crisis. The EU is regarded more and more as a mere bureaucracy, and the legal instruments that it issues are regarded as making the everyday lives of citizens more difficult, rather than easier. Convincing citizens of the benefits of the EU is primarily the duty of politicians. The participation of citizens in public debate on the various EU policy areas is something that must be promoted. It is only in this way that we will be able to build a Europe that is really supported by the people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the concept of EU citizenship became a reality 20 years ago with the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, yet public awareness of EU citizenship is still very low. The 2010 Eurobarometer survey showed that only 43 % of respondents were actually familiar with the term ‘Citizen of the European Union’, and even fewer knew what it meant – although the Irish figure at that stage was 58 %.</p>
      <p sl="en">The purpose of the European Year of Citizens must be to raise awareness about the rights and responsibilities of EU citizens, the role citizens play in exercising the right to free movement and the importance of civic and democratic participation, including participation in European and local elections. No doubt many of the planned initiatives for next year will be carried out through programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme in our schools and institutions, and this will pave the way for a more concerted longer-term effort to raise awareness about EU citizenship. I am concerned about the reduction in the budget from a proposed 5 million to just 1 million, but I also want to welcome the fact that the European Year of the Citizen coincides with the start of the Irish Presidency, and I know that the Irish Government is committed to holding events to promote the European Year throughout its presidency.</p>

It is therefore only right and proper, not to mention extremely important, to make it a priority to explain to our citizens what the European Union means and how it makes life easier for each and every one of us every day.

As has been mentioned today, it is 20 years since the concept of European citizenship was launched. It is not enough for this sort of concept to exist; the biggest problem in the European Union right now is the fact that citizens do not feel that the Union is theirs.

Under this programme, which will take place during the next programming period, we will invest a sum of approximately 10 cents a year for every citizen of the European Union.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have previously called on this House to make a bonfire of EU quangos. EU agencies are inefficient, unnecessary and unaccountable. I hope that the scandals of the European Environment, Medicine and Food Safety agencies will make Members think twice about what these quangos do.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Environment Agency’s relationship with an NGO, which it sent on trips to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, are totally unacceptable. The agency’s lack of regard for public procurement procedures is also offensive, especially as so many public bodies in my London constituency are struggling to abide by complicated EU public procurement rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we get to the area where I feel all EU bodies are wasting money: information and communication. The agency’s ‘living façade’ was a EUR 300 000 over-indulgence. I congratulate the rapporteur on recommending a vote against granting discharge.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, regarding the discharge for the European Environmental Agency, I asked colleagues to refuse discharge. We even had more information than we had in May, when we decided to postpone discharge. We had information and written evidence of contracts of over one million euros, which probably breached the procedural rules for procurement, because they were designed specifically for certain companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the discharge was granted following a close vote. I lost, but I think that, at the end of the day, after we voted three times in the COCOBU and once in plenary against the discharge of this Agency, the signal has been sent. Finally I would like to say that it was bad management to let the executive director decide whether a discharge is given and not the agency on environmental issues, and I ask for the resignation of this executive director.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the entire Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted for discharge for this agency. In our vote, we had to balance the assertions that indicate an element of corruption – but without having seen the report of the European Anti-Fraud Office or any relevant authority – with the report of the Court of Auditors, which expresses criticism but does not make any accusations, with the statements of the two Commissioners who evaluated the Agency’s management (I am referring here to Commissioner Potočnik and Commissioner Šemeta) and the statements of a board comprising mainly prestigious bodies, especially Cambridge University. All of this indicates that those involved in the Agency’s management appreciate its performance and its leadership.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Mere suspicions alone should not prevent us from granting discharge for a European agency. It is only natural that such suspicions be backed up by evidence. What would happen if tomorrow we refused to grant discharge for the Commission because it was alleged in some newspaper that Mr Barroso had who knows what sort of important business in a Member State, yet these were just harmful allegations?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, why is it that a trade agreement that will facilitate the import of high-quality and affordable medicines into Europe is such a political hot potato? Because the trade agreement is with Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">To provide European patients with life-saving drugs at lower prices has taken over two years of negotiations, even though this is an already established joint commitment with Israel. We need to use more generic drugs to lower our healthcare bills. Israel, despite its small size, is at the forefront of major medical innovations. By using Israel’s generic drugs, the cost to healthcare systems for blood pressure medication, for example, could be reduced by 92 %.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very important report, but I regret to say that I abstained in the final vote on it, for two very good reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is that 72 % of the world’s poor live in the middle-income countries and the Commission is proposing to reduce, and then eliminate altogether, the support that we give to middle-income countries for poverty alleviation. If we do that, our entire poverty elimination programme is just going to be a farce, and will be of no use to the European Union at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we sadly endorsed in the report the Financial Transaction Tax. I think this is a hugely damaging move. It will drive people in the financial services sector away from Europe – particularly from the great City of London, where financial services are the prime revenue earner – to other places, like Dubai, Hong Kong and New York, where there is no Financial Transaction Tax. Should a tax like this be introduced, it should be global. There is no effort at all to introduce it at a global level, so I think it is a very bad move.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, as the shadow rapporteur for this report in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I know how difficult it was to incorporate a perception of development aid as a whole into the resolution. Even the members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the Committee on Development approved my amendment on inter-generational solidarity. However, in plenary today, the S&amp;D Group asked for a separate vote on paragraph 15. Its objective was to remove family mainstreaming from development aid. The family is the cornerstone of every policy directed towards the future. This is as true in Africa as it is in Europe. Without family policy and inter-generational solidarity, there is no struggle against poverty or sustainable development. I am therefore pleased that paragraph 15 was eventually retained in the approved text.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I am sure that in the future, a number of emerging countries will need to be taken off the list of countries receiving assistance, because at the moment Europe is in a rather delicate situation. Many citizens, for example, the Portuguese, are looking for work in Brazil, and Brazil is still on the list of supported countries. It is important to re-orient changes towards social protection systems, governance and sustained growth. I am saying this because just recently, after an analysis of the support given to African countries, the rumour resurfaced that the assistance Europe gives Africa is ‘fatal’.

Emerging states should allocate larger sums towards this objective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in 2015, concerted action is needed. I also believe that the Union must consider the groups most prone to poverty, and I am referring here to children, women, old and disabled people.

      <p sl="it">It is therefore necessary to harmonise national industrial polices to a greater degree, while it is also essential to achieve another objective: internationalisation of SMEs. Only 25 % of SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market. I therefore agree with the actions proposed by the Commission aimed at encouraging the process of internationalisation and the need expressed by the rapporteur for provision of specific information about priority markets together with details of the various support services available.</p>

Tiny businesses, micro-entities, should be exempt from vast swathes of European legislation, a policy that is now supported by the European Commission, but this Parliament’s report sets hurdles for tiny companies to go through before they can get that exemption.

      <p sl="en">The Commission must accomplish the aim to increase and help small and medium-sized businesses by ensuring that they have access to Structural Funds.

The Commission must also promote more harmonisation between the Member States in order to enhance competition, which will further grow the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of this step towards more harmonisation, the Commission must also conduct a fitness check to review any existing erroneous or overbearing regulations. We need simple, clear and transparent regulations that are also predictable. These steps entail a long, time-consuming process, which is what we have now.

At present, European provisions impose excessive administrative and bureaucratic burdens, which firms under financial strain are often unable to handle.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am in favour of strong support for micro-enterprises. We should take action to help citizens onto the job market, in particular young people. By offering temporary allowances and concessions, the relevant authorities should encourage people to start and run a business.

The majority in Parliament support the concentration of capital in the European Investment Bank (EIB) to cover expected and unexpected losses resulting from loans and guarantees. This risk sharing is established between the EIB and other national or international, public or private financial institutions, which will grant loans to project sponsors and banks in order to provide private cofinancing to projects implemented using contributions from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Other methods exist and could have been used to overcome the existing limitations of private investment. These methods would not have resulted in a reduction, in practice, in the overall financial envelope of these countries, but would rather have boosted it.

The EMA, which was set up in 1993 but only entered into operation in 1995, is responsible for protecting and promoting public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and/or veterinary use. No medicine can be marketed without authorisation from this Agency.

The year 2013 will be very important for promoting and enhancing our shared European identity based on fundamental European Union values.

The year is being designated Year of European Citizens to mark the 20th anniversary of EU citizenship, enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht.

In Hungary, too, I have witnessed the process whereby growing numbers of EU citizens are leaving their native Member State and settling in my home country.

More emphasis should therefore be placed on participatory democracy and the new rights deriving from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, such as the Citizens’ Initiative. We agree with the need for information, education and awareness campaigns, accessible to all citizens, with the preparation of an action plan in the run-up to the European Year, in collaboration with all Member States, EU institutions and civil society, and with the organisation of a pan-European campaign on Union Citizenship in 2013 by the European Parliament, in collaboration with the national parliaments.

Today there is still a lack of visibility of Union citizenship and lack of awareness of the concrete benefits it provides to EU citizens. According to a Eurobarometer study published in September 2011, among the most common problems that EU citizens face when they reside, study or work in another EU country are lack of information and awareness of their rights as well as language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas and qualifications. These barriers have become more severe at the present time of economic and financial crisis within the EU, because of the negative consequences of the crisis, including the rise of unemployment and social unrest.

Of course, the economic crisis has made it more difficult to appreciate the original reasons for the Union and its advantages. It is easier to underline the negative aspects, perhaps for internal electoral reasons. The report draws up a proposal that is of particular importance at this moment in history. We do not mean to update the ambitions of Porfirio Díaz for the 21st century, but rather to spread a basic awareness of the positive values and effects attached to Union citizenship, even on a practical level and in terms of opportunities, to counter the effects of continuous underlining of the failings of European integration, real or otherwise. We cannot allow European citizenship to mean no more to our young people than a different passport queue at airports.

I would also like to welcome the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, which, in addition to raising the self-esteem of European citizens, represents recognition of the work carried out by the EU institutions to consolidate peace in various conflict regions. Europe is an area of free movement of persons and goods where, without losing our national identities, we feel imbued with a spirit of fraternity and solidarity that needs to be propagated. Many European citizens are unaware of their rights as such. For that reason, the ‘European Year of Citizens’ will provide an excellent opportunity to conduct information and awareness campaigns on this project in order to make European citizens more aware and participative.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report advocates establishing a European Year of Citizens (2013) in order to raise awareness about the rights deriving from Union citizenship. Unfortunately, the current political, economic and social context could not be more contrary to the view of the EU – which the report adopts – as an area of democracy, equality, solidarity and citizen participation. This view is contradicted every day by the practice, policies and priorities that the EU is imposing on various people and countries, as is the case with Portugal. We are currently witnessing an unprecedented attack on democracy and the rights of citizens. The EU is increasingly an area of inequality, exploitation and loss of the rights for which people have fought and won over centuries. In this EU of free movement of capital and goods, which serves the international monopolies, the ‘free’ movement of people is conditioned by the hard reality for millions of workers, who have no possibility of remaining in their own country due to a lack of jobs and who are forced to seek support for their families elsewhere.</p>

Union citizenship, conferred automatically on all nationals of the respective Member States, is additional to national citizenship. At the present time, we are targeting the lack of visibility of Union citizenship and lack of awareness of the concrete benefits it provides to citizens, students, consumers, and business people as well as to providers of goods and services in the European Union. The most common problems that EU citizens face when they reside, study or work in another EU country are the lack of information and awareness of their rights as well as the language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas and qualifications. Citizens want concrete solutions to their daily problems, equal opportunities for all, without discrimination on the grounds of nationality, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, belief or religion.

      <p sl="pl">Citizens are at the heart of the European Union’s policies. This is confirmed in a series of documents, presided over by the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Unfortunately, although they enjoy many rights, EU citizens are often unable to exercise them because they are unaware that they have these rights. An interesting discussion during the launch of Single Market Week, in which it was predominantly citizens participating, revealed this lack of information to be a huge problem and, ultimately, a real barrier to making full use of the opportunities offered by the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the most important opportunities is the right of freedom of movement within the EU. It is this right that will allow us to develop the mobility that is of such key importance to the European economy. Exploiting the potential arising from mobility depends, however, on citizens being fully informed of the rights associated with it. I welcome the Commission’s proposal to make 2013 the European Year of Citizens, because it will be a great opportunity to communicate information in the most effective way possible to citizens in every corner of the EU and at EU, national, regional and local level.</p>

Numerous communication campaigns are organised every year to bring the citizens closer to the institutions and give them a better understanding of the actions carried out at EU level. For example, in 2009, an estimated 11.9 million Union citizens were living in another Member State than their own and the creation of the internal market has only served to increase such movements. Nevertheless, many Europeans feel that the obstacles to mobility within the EU are still too high, especially the lack of information about administrative issues, social welfare systems and the recognition of university qualifications. That is why 2013 has been designated European Year of Citizens. Its purpose will be to raise awareness of the rights attached to European citizenship in a cross-border context.

A Eurobarometer study, published in September 2011, shows that among the most common problems that EU citizens face when they reside, study or work in another EU country are the lack of information and awareness of their rights as well as the language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas and qualifications.

      <p sl="fr">As recent Eurobarometer surveys show, Europe is experiencing a crisis of confidence and trust. Since autumn 2009, the number of people who trust the EU has fallen by around 30 %. Given that next year we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the creation of European citizenship and we will be less than a year from the European elections, it is a good idea to make 2013 the European Year of Citizens, a year for the citizens of Europe. In the hope of conferring on 2013 a symbolic significance, particularly in the current context, I voted for this text. It has become clear that the citizens do not have enough information about their rights as EU citizens. We must make every effort to ensure that the Year of European Citizens succeeds in raising citizens’ awareness of their rights. We also have to take effective measures to stimulate their interest in the activities of the European Union as that is crucial for the development of European democracy, which in turn is so important for the EU’s legitimacy. However, the success of this Year obviously depends on the financial resources allocated to it, and in this regard, I regret that its budget is so meagre.</p>

We are currently celebrating 20 years of the internal market, which we often accuse of having prioritised the movement of goods over the movement of people, and competition over solidarity. There are still many obstacles to exercising fully the rights conferred by European citizenship. The first of these is knowing what they are. In theory, we should all be aware of them. In practice, unfortunately, few of us are: confusion over the transposition of Directives, complexity of the decision-making process and lack of interest among the citizens mean that we need to raise awareness of our European rights. Indeed, once we are aware of the advantages of European citizenship, we must be able to put them into practice. EU territory is far from a homogeneous, uniform living space for its citizens. Sometimes, it seems as though the elimination of controls of people crossing internal borders has created as many problems as it has solved. In these times of crisis, the European project and European citizenship must rediscover their relevance. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must be our opportunity to put the citizens back at the heart of European legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is almost 20 years since European citizenship was founded and was automatically conferred on all citizens of the Member States. As a result, they acquired many rights across the territory of the European Union. They can now vote in local elections in their country of residence, take part in the European elections and stay, live and study in any Member State. Unfortunately, as the report shows, only 43 % of EU citizens are familiar with the term ‘citizen of the European Union’, while as many as 67 % believe they are not well informed of their rights. On top of that, officials and employers are guilty of all manner of abuses and discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, which effectively discourages many people from travelling and working abroad. Diplomas and qualifications are not recognised, while the language barrier makes it difficult for people to exercise their rights. The present economic crisis and unemployment only exacerbate these problems. For that reason, I greatly welcome the Commission’s proposal to designate 2013 the European Year of Citizens. We must do our utmost to make the best possible use of this time to increase citizens’ awareness of their rights. Furthermore, we cannot allow European solidarity and the sense of belonging that has built up over the years to cease to exist as a result of a temporary financial crisis.

The European Union has achieved many important objectives in the areas of protection of rights, health, and freedom of movement within the territory of the Member States, but I think Europe can play a still greater role in the daily lives of its citizens.

There is far too little awareness of this issue among Europe’s citizens, especially as regards the rights attached to it.

The European Year of Citizens therefore offers a great opportunity to bring the European project closer to citizens and to contribute to the development of a European public sphere. This is the only way to ensure the active involvement of the people. Europe does not only need politicians; above all, it needs people who are willing and able to engage in society. If the European Year is to be successful, two key prerequisites must be fulfilled: firstly, European civil society organisations must be closely involved in preparation and implementation. Secondly, there must be appropriate deployment of financial resources.

In our opinion, organising the European Year of Citizens (2013) is nothing more than an EU strategy to try and legitimise the idea of the EU as an area of democracy, equality, solidarity and citizen participation at a time when the European institutions lack public credibility. In reality, the EU is not an area of free movement of persons, and this initiative, albeit in a surreptitious manner, will propagandise the single market as an area of freedom. Bearing in mind the difficult situation that workers are currently facing and the need for emigration to cope with unemployment in their countries of origin, we introduced into the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs the idea of the need to safeguard workers’ social security and trade union rights, and that labour mobility should not be interpreted by some employers as an opportunity to reduce wages, cut back on social security or, in general, to downgrade working conditions.</p>

Sergei Magnitsky was a courageous Russian lawyer who died in a Russian prison, as a result of mistreatment, where he was being held after his arrest for fighting corruption in Russia. Despite all of the efforts made with the Russian Government to ensure that this case was properly investigated and that those responsible were tried by an independent court, the fact is that, despite the promises made by those in power, nothing has yet been done and this case continues to be raised at summits with Russia. This image of a lack of freedom and credibility is calling into question the consolidation of the democratic process, as reinforced by Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organisation, and is deterring investors.

Visa restrictions and other restrictive measures are not in themselves traditional judicial sanctions, but constitute a necessary and legitimate foreign policy tool, constituting a signal of the Union’s concern.

I believe that the specific restrictions proposed on persons who are responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky will serve as a serious warning to the Russian authorities and may have a significant effect on the actions of Russian officials in the future. I very much hope that these restrictions will change the current climate of impunity there. I am satisfied that increasing numbers of Europe’s political decision-makers are aware that it is necessary to adopt a firm, robust and comprehensive EU policy towards Russia.

Despite the fact that the implementation of the SES has already taken many positive steps forward, I am particularly concerned with the timing aspects of its implementation.

However, the impact of the crisis cannot be ignored, as underlined by the Association of European Airlines, whose Secretary General Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus in a recent interview forecast operating losses of EUR 2 billion for the whole sector. This combination of rising demand and falling operating profits makes implementation of the new Single European Sky (SES) legislation imperative, since corrections and restructuring are unavoidable (for example, to take account of the tendency for supply to move progressively towards European Low Fares Airline Association carriers).

Specifically, it means that implementation of the FABs and the deployment of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) technology will result in flight times being shortened by approximately 10 %, 50 % fewer flight cancellations and delays, and a net saving in CO2 emissions of some 50 million tonnes.

Customers must be in a position to ascertain the actual total price from the moment that they start booking. The Commission must prohibit every unfair commercial practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the last 10 years we have developed a series of EU passenger rights, regardless of the mode of transport, to ensure a minimum level of protection, thereby facilitating mobility and at the same time creating uniform competition conditions for carriers. Unfortunately, these rights are still not being applied completely and correctly, either by carriers or by national authorities. It is therefore vital to revise the current legislation in order to make it clearer and to strengthen passenger rights, particularly the right to information on their rights and how they can exercise them. Effective and efficient application of these rights can only be guaranteed if they are actively and effectively monitored by national enforcement bodies. Passenger rights are therefore based on three pillars: non-discrimination, accurate, timely and accessible information, and immediate and proportionate assistance. I therefore support this initiative which, as one of the measures included in the communications on a Single Market Act, lists the rights and principles applicable to all modes of transport, while making distinctions due to the specific characteristics of each mode of transport, and identifies the areas in which greater convergence must be achieved as well as current shortcomings.</p>

It should be possible in the medium term to draw up a single cross-cutting passenger rights regulation, and it is essential to do so in order to promote intermodality. The legislation addresses the problems of air transport by eliminating ambiguities concerning passenger rights and clarifying issues relating to the responsibilities of air carriers in the case of denied boarding, long delays, cancellations, lost luggage, and barrier-free access to airport facilities. Regulation (EC) No 137/2007, in force since 2009, significantly strengthened the rights of rail passengers, but since EU provisions were framed to take account of the diversity in national rail systems, this has allowed Member States to exempt certain services from the application of passenger rights.

In fact, in recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of passengers carried, particularly in aviation due to the ‘low cost’ concept. This increase in the number of passengers carried has brought with it an increase in the number of problems in this sector. Every day hundreds of transport services are cancelled or delayed, causing serious complications for passengers (workers, students, tourists, etc.). Sometimes passengers are not aware of their rights, perhaps due to negligence on the part of the carriers themselves, particularly with regard to assistance when transport services are cancelled.

It also aims to ensure rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility travelling by air, in relation to access, information and adequate training. As regards rail transport, it proposes improvements in the protection of passengers and their baggage and on the issue of delays and accidents. However, it is worrying that these rights can be challenged, bearing in mind, for example, that it is considered ‘essential to strike a balance between the need for passenger rights in the case of rural bus services and … to ensure that the burden is not so heavy as to make such services unviable in the future’.

      <p sl="sk">Since the relevant goals were set out in the Commission’s 2001 White Paper, a comprehensive EU passenger rights package has been developed for all modes, affording basic protection to passengers while ensuring a level playing field for carriers. The existing regulations have failed to provide clarity on passenger rights or the responsibilities of service providers and therefore require revision. The common criteria (non-discrimination, equal treatment, physical and ICT accessibility, the requirements of ‘design for all’, fulfilment of the transport contract, exact and accessible information given in good time before, during and after travel, and appropriate assistance without delay in the event of problems and possible compensation) together with the 10 specific passenger rights (defined by the Commission in its communication) correspond to the main rights cutting across modes and form a solid basis for establishing a legally enforceable charter of passenger rights. The same fundamental principles and rights have been introduced across all modes of transport so that travelling in the EU – thanks to an increase in service quality, passenger protection and the appeal of the European transport sector – is easier and pleasanter. These passenger rights remain an integral part of the European vision for transport policy, although the conditions and methods of implementation of these rights differ and are still developing.</p>

Individual passenger rights have already been established at the European level for all modes of transport. In the aviation and rail sectors, these are already in force.

This report is to be welcomed as it draws attention to the remaining problems relating to passenger rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Among other things, the strengthening and clarification of rights are essential. Enforcement of these rights is often problematical and transparency must be increased, as travellers are still not receiving adequate information about their rights to compensation and reimbursement.

      <p sl="it">A common core of rights applying to all modes, a basic level of service, and a standard way of proceeding for carriers and enforcement bodies as a whole are required if intermodal travel is to work and become a matter of course in the EU internal market. The Commission has so far failed in its attempt to develop a European multimodal travel planner that would enable passengers to plan their journeys across Europe using a whole variety of means of transport. The Member States, together with the Commission, should seek to remove the obstacles preventing carriers from developing a travel planner of this kind. I voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Consumer law in transport modes is highly developed in the European Union. However, we must acknowledge that the existing legislation has a number of shortcomings. I therefore support this resolution, which aims to provide solutions for the remaining gaps. For example, too often, in the event of delays or cancellations, consumers are not reimbursed for their travel because the company pleads extraordinary circumstances and is thus exempt from having to provide compensation or a refund. For that reason, I welcome the resolution’s call to the Commission to provide a clearer definition of these circumstances. Another key element, in my opinion, is the information that must be provided to consumers and the assistance that may be offered to them in the event of a problem. Consequently, personnel must be able to take immediate decisions and deal with claims for compensation or reimbursement. Finally, I support the call to the Commission to present legislative measures to improve complaint procedures, in particular, the introduction of a standard complaint form.</p>

Essentially, the crux of passenger rights is considered to be the entitlement to fulfilment of the transport contract. Delays are accordingly the case in which the compensation arrangements are most clear cut.

I also agree with the call for inclusion of better levels of assistance for persons with disabilities. In fact, I made a similar proposal, acting in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in the European disability strategy.

      <p sl="et">I believe that the report adopted today on passenger rights in all transport modes has considerable importance for the transport sector, but above all for passengers. Given the continuous growth of the transport sector and the increasing number of passengers in all transport modes, equivalent and relevant passenger rights must be guaranteed. This is becoming ever more important because in many cases travelling involves several different transport modes rather than just one. Unfortunately, there was no support for the idea to require the Commission to consolidate all rights into a single regulation, which in my opinion would have made them more accessible and clearer for all stakeholders. One of the essential common features of passenger rights in the different transport modes is the prohibition on discriminating against passengers on the basis of their place of residence or citizenship and against travel agencies on the basis of their place of business. Furthermore, as regards passenger rights, I find it important to take the rights and possibilities of the elderly, the disabled and persons with limited mobility fully into account. Uniform pan-European passenger rights must be available for everyone. In view of the above, I voted in favour of this report.</p>

For us personally, when travelling every week to Brussels or Strasbourg from different Member States, we find that sufficient information is often lacking in real time. In the draft amendment of passenger rights, the Commission should clearly define ‘exceptional circumstances’ for the disruption of transport and passenger rights for those using more than one transport mode. The current EU legislation in the field of passenger rights is still not being implemented and pursued in all transport modes or in all parts of the EU, which is hindering competitiveness and affecting citizens’ confidence in travelling. The introduction of common standards for the carriage of hand luggage is extremely essential, since many carriers demand a payment immediately before boarding which exceeds the price of the air ticket for just 1 kg of excess weight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this report, which called for an improvement in passenger rights in all transport modes. Among the suggestions for achieving this goal, I support, in particular, the idea of a European charter that is available to travellers and contains the 10 basic passenger rights. In emergencies and unforeseen situations, it would be useful for travellers to have access to a simple document setting out the most basic rights. Discouraged by the complexity of complaint procedures, passengers all too often decide not to exercise their right to compensation. To remedy this, I proposed a standard complaint form and a maximum time limit for complaint handling for all modes of transport, and that idea was accepted. Finally, the report calls for greater price transparency on the internet, because too often the advertised price is far from being the final price. In my opinion, it should be a more accurate reflection of the price to be paid and should not hide administrative and credit card fees in order to lure customers. The ball is now in the Commission’s court and it must come back to us with an ambitious legislative proposal.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Parliament’s report on passenger rights should be supported because, firstly, it calls for the introduction of legal certainty in relation to passenger rights in all transport modes. Passenger complaints for each type of transport – air, rail, waterborne and road transport – in the various Member States are considered and passenger rights issues are resolved in various different monitoring bodies. Therefore, there is often a lack of clarity about the handling of legal provisions and the procedure for considering complaints. In the future, therefore, passenger rights, including rights to compensation, refunds and information, on all transport modes must be based on a common foundation of legal regulation, which must of course take into account the particularities of each type of transport.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The report also points out that in air transport the definitions of delays and cancellation of flights is still too often interpreted in different ways. Another important issue is the need to have a clearer definition of the concept of ‘extraordinary circumstances’, since a technical fault should not be considered to be an extraordinary circumstance; the carrier is responsible for such a fault.</p>
      <p sl="lv">I welcome the fact that Parliament’s report returns once again to the issue of basic fares, which was recently considered in another report. The basic fare ought to include costs which are linked to the carrier’s legal obligations, such as safety, security and passenger rights, and to the provision of tickets and boarding cards or the carrying of a minimum amount of luggage, and all costs related to payment, such as credit card costs.</p>

Given that, under Article 335 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, ‘the Union shall be represented by each of the institutions, by virtue of their administrative autonomy, in matters relating to their respective operation’, and that an efficient supervision over the budgetary implementation process is a matter of high responsibility and its fulfilment depends entirely on an unhindered interinstitutional cooperation between the Council and Parliament, I voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

The primary task of the Committee on Budgetary Control is to scrutinise and ensure that the EU budget is being implemented appropriately and effectively. The discharge report highlights the main problem concerning the European Environment Agency is that several errors relating to public procurement procedure occurred during the Agency’s 2010 management period. The report also draws attention to the fact that several conflicts of interest at the Agency had recently come to light. The committee will not recommend granting the discharge until these issues are clarified. At its sitting in late March, the Committee on Budgetary Control decided to postpone granting the discharge. In the view of the committee, several additional questions relating to Agency management in 2010 require clarification before the Agency is granted discharge. The situation has not changed significantly since spring. In my view the Agency should have made more of an effort to restore appropriate management procedures and comply with operational regulations.

The EEA, which was created in 1993, currently has 32 members: the 27 Member States of the European Union, together with Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Turkey. Its objective is to help the EU and national governments make informed decisions about the environment.

Three aspects stand out in this assessment: painting of the façade of the Agency’s building without issuing a public tender, which, in order to cover the costs, required a reinforcement of budget line 2140 – ‘Fitting-out of premises’; contradictory information sent by the Executive Director on her relationship with Earthwatch, and use by a non-governmental organisation of the EEA’s premises, without any rent payment.

At this time when we are faced with a severe economic, financial and social crisis, with one of the main consequences being increased unemployment, the EU should use every means at its disposal to react, particularly as regards the support to be provided to those who find themselves without a job.

While it is always a tragedy to have a large workforce face redundancy and a sad indictment of the economic woes in which Europe finds itself, it is my belief that the EU has been part architect of the current situation through austerity and cuts that have killed consumer confidence and exacerbated the economic crisis. The EU should therefore not be in a position to pour money into its failings. The EU is an outdated model that is not fit for purpose in a globalised market place. National bodies should have full jurisdiction over trade and employment and forge partnerships with third countries to manage in times of crisis and provide for their workforce in both good and bad times.

The EGF can help workers who have been made redundant to stay in the labour market and must continue after 2013 as an instrument available to all workers. In its 23 October resolution on the 2014-20 MFF, the EP rightly placed considerable emphasis on continuing the EGF after 2013. I do welcome the recent Cyprus Presidency proposals to continue the EGF after 2013 though I am concerned that it is proposing to cap spending at EUR 245 million per annum, down from the Commission’s proposed EUR 429 million per annum.

One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. Irish authorities argue that Talk Talk was a customer service centre based in Waterford, originally set up to provide services for both the companies Talk Talk UK and AOL UK. The company supported Talk Talk’s UK market for broadband, voice and, more recently, for TV via inbound, outbound, email and white mail services. Following the purchase of the UK’s ISP division of AOL, broadband services under the AOL Broadband brand were also provided. Talk Talk offered telecoms services to residential Irish customers under the Talk Talk and AOL brands and to business customers under the Opal brand. It also provided full lifecycle management of Talk Talk’s customers in the UK. Talk Talk in Waterford, as near-shore location for the provision of shared services for a foreign client (AOL and Talk Talk UK), benefited from the international trend over the past decade known as business process outsourcing (BPO). BPO typically involves a company contracting specific operations or processes to a third party provider.</p>

      <p sl="en">In this part-session alone we have voted on eight applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. This clearly shows the road to economic and social disaster along which the capitalist and neoliberal policies are leading the EU countries. This application concerns 592 redundancies in the telecommunications sector, of which 432 are targeted for assistance, in Talk Talk Broadband Services (Ireland) Limited in Ireland and six of its suppliers related to the same collective redundancy procedure. It involves the mobilisation of EUR 2 696 382 to provide assistance to those workers made redundant as a result of the relocation of work to the United Kingdom, India, the Philippines and South Africa. We are approving palliatives, which may be temporarily useful, but the disease must really be attacked at the root: we must break with these neoliberal policies which are leading us into the depths of despair without any glimpse, even fleetingly, of a small ray of hope for the millions of workers and their families who are losing the right to work and to a dignified life.</p>

The EU should therefore not be in a position to pour money into its failings. The EU is an outdated model that is not fit for purpose in a globalised market place. National bodies should have full jurisdiction over trade and employment and forge partnerships with third countries to manage in times of crisis and provide for their workforce in both good and bad times.

      <p sl="en">In 2011, 878 workers in the shipbuilding industry in the region of Galicia lost their jobs. While it is always a tragedy to have a large workforce face redundancy and a sad indictment of the economic woes in which Europe finds itself, it is my belief that the EU has been part architect of the current situation through austerity and cuts that have killed consumer confidence and exacerbated the economic crisis. The EU should therefore not be in a position to pour money into its failings. The EU is an outdated model that is not fit for purpose in a globalised market place. National bodies should have full jurisdiction over trade and employment and forge partnerships with third countries to manage in times of crisis and provide for their workforce in both good and bad times. Member States such as the UK would have more financial aid to provide of their own accord without EU membership and without the burden of red tape that being a member of the European Union inevitably brings.</p>

As I said last month in my explanation of vote on report A7-0232/2012, the shipbuilding industry has been severely affected by the current economic crisis, with its effects extending to those industries supporting this sector. This is the situation which has occurred in Galicia and which has led to the redundancy of 878 workers. I would add that these redundancies have occurred in Galicia, a Spanish region which applied to the EGF in 2010 due to restructuring in the textile sector and where the unemployment rate is already high.

Although we support this mobilisation, as it is essential to support these workers, we would reiterate our reservations and criticisms regarding the perversity of this Fund. It would have been better for measures to have been taken to avoid the unemployment of these workers. We cannot fail to draw parallels with the situation of Estaleiros Navais de Viana do Castelo, where the workers are fighting to maintain the public nature of the enterprise, which is strategically important, and to keep their jobs. Privatisation, which we strongly oppose, would leave the jobs of hundreds of workers at the mercy of the interests of any future multinational owner (and of the division of work as it saw fit).</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Commission rightly noted that the global financial crisis has had a significant negative impact on the development of Europe’s shipbuilding industry. Production at European shipyards has decreased, and according to CESA the shipbuilding workforce in Europe declined by 23 % over the past three years. In Galicia, the figure was even worse, at 30 %, for a sector which represents 45 % of the Spanish shipbuilding industry. Unemployment in Galicia rose from 8 % at the end of 2008 to 17.25 % in late 2011. I therefore welcome the EGF aid for 450 workers, which will include occupational guidance and accompaniment towards business creation or self-employment, as well as general re-training and vocational training, among other measures. I was particularly pleased to see that some funding will be reserved for contribution to commuting expenses and assistance for carers of dependent persons.

      <p sl="en">I voted for this proposal. One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. The Spanish authorities explain that the shipbuilding industry consists of three main areas of activity: manufacture of other transport equipment (NACE Revision 2 Division 30), repair and installation of machinery and equipment (NACE Revision 2 Division 33) and manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment (NACE Revision 2 Division 25). The enterprises concerned by the application are manufacturers of fabricated metal products which operate in the shipbuilding ancillary industry. Citing data from the Community of European Shipyards Association (CESA) and the Gerencia del Sector Naval (GSN), which is a body under the Spanish ministry of industry, the Spanish authorities argue that the global financial crisis changed several of the conditions and expectations for the future development of the shipbuilding market. Order books of European yards decreased both in CGT and value terms as an effect of the global economic crisis. The European order book dropped from 13.69 million CGT to 9.47 million CGT between 2008 and 2009, and further to 6.39 million CGT in 2010.</p>

As MEP for Galicia, I supported this decision, despite feeling that this is not what the industry needs in order to stop the constant rise in unemployment. Over 10 000 jobs have disappeared in the sector due to the lack of an alternative to tax lease for the Galician shipbuilding industry, added to which is the veto on construction in the Navantia Ferrol shipyard. This huge problem cannot be solved with a quick fix of EUR 2 million for 500 unemployed workers, when thousands of jobs have been lost in the last year alone. In this respect, we call on the European Commission to adopt a final decision once and for all: a preferential alternative tax system for the shipbuilding industry in Galicia, which has been in suspense since the withdrawal of the tax lease system which, in practice, was designed to ensure that Galician shipyards competed on a level playing field with their counterparts across the EU. The ban on construction in the Navantia Ferrol shipyard also needs to be lifted.

      <p sl="en">The intolerable stream of requests to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund demonstrates the inhumanity of capitalism and the magnitude of its structural crisis. In this case, another 435 workers have been made redundant in the construction sector in the Netherlands. The justification given by employers for these redundancies is the sharp drop in demand or, in other words, the fall in consumption and purchasing power, accompanied by the difficulty in obtaining credit. These are the same arguments as used on other occasions. Our support for mobilising the Fund stems from the evident need to support those workers made redundant. However, we in no way accept as legitimate the policy of redundancies and the failure by employers to assume responsibility. We need investment policies that will create and maintain jobs with rights, and not this never-ending destruction of productive forces and jobs.</p>

The Netherlands applied for EGF support for 516 workers who lost their jobs at 54 small and medium-sized construction enterprises operating in Gelderland, which with 2 million inhabitants is the Netherlands’ biggest province, and an area where construction is a major employer. The package aims to help workers by offering them job-search assistance, vocational training, and entrepreneurship courses.

This is a recurring theme in a number of EU policy debates at present, so I think it is appropriate and important that Europe ‘put its money where its mouth is’ when it comes to keeping older Europeans working.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Today we voted for eight reports on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Ever since the Fund was established in 2006, we have always previously abstained from voting, since we were against the Fund from the outset, because we do not feel that the Fund is the right instrument for helping employees who are hit by structural changes. The Fund has now grown, developed and received its own grant. It exists, and it will not disappear in the foreseeable future. We have therefore now decided to take a position on every single case; whether it meets the very strict requirements for cofinancing and long-term measures for generating employment that are imposed on applicants. In this case, we felt that the applicants meet these requirements. Within the framework of work on the budget and long-term budget, we continue to support a more effective, long-term instrument for increasing employment, confronting structural changes and increasing flexibility in the labour market.</p>

One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. The Dutch authorities argue that the European aluminium sector suffered from a sudden drop in consumer demand (a reduction by 25.7 % from average EU aluminium usage between 2008 and 2009. The production of Zalco Aluminium Zeeland Company NV was dependent on the construction and transport industry (which represented 63 % of the main end-user market of aluminium products in Europe in 2010). The majority of Zalco’s Aluminium Zeeland Company NV production was produced for the rolling and extrusion industry. Almost their entire production of extrusion billets was used for the construction and transport industries, and in particular in the automotive sector. Zalco Aluminium Zeeland Company NV suffered from the declining demand – due to the global financial and economic crisis – in these two sectors leading, after unsuccessful attempts to overcome the difficulties, to bankruptcy at the end of 2011.</p>

The request has been made by France in favour of 5 100 workers made redundant by PSA Peugeot Citroën, of which over 41.55 % are older than 55 years, which therefore raises a question (and concern) about the type of support to be provided in practice and about the future that may be hoped for these workers, who traditionally find it harder to get a new job. It should be added that, in the redundancy plan negotiated with workers, Peugeot has included the EGF support as an integral part of the package to compensate those workers made redundant. This is using the Fund in a way for which it was not designed, but to which it clearly lends itself. We maintain our position of solidarity with those workers made redundant as a direct result of the EU’s policies and the structural crisis in capitalism, despite the fact that we can never agree with this Fund being mobilised as a way of ‘negotiating’ redundancy conditions with workers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many of my MEP colleagues are aware that Peugeot Citroën recently announced a further wave of redundancies – this is further proof, as if any were needed, that the global automotive industry is still struggling to deal with the worst effects of the economic crisis. This EGF application is not linked to these recent developments, but rather to an earlier announcement of redundancies at Peugeot Citroën in 2009 and 2010. As was the case in the US, ongoing restructuring in some aspects of the European car industry is necessary in order for it to regain global competitiveness. I therefore think it was appropriate that we MEPs today agreed to provide EUR 11.9 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to help the 2 089 workers who were made redundant in that period. The French regions affected by the redundancies are Bretagne, Franche-Comté, Île-de-France, Alsace and Lorraine – most of whom have higher unemployment than the national average. I also consider it appropriate at this time to echo the Commission’s call to maintain the EGF for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, while further improving its functioning. The Fund is a concrete example of the twin EU value of solidarity and added value, and should be maintained.</p>

At the request of Nicolas Sarkozy’s Government, the European Commission has proposed allocating almost EUR 12 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support the 2 089 workers who were made redundant between 1 November 2009 and 28 February 2010. This application was submitted by France after the collapse in the demand for new cars at the start of the crisis in 2008 (down 10.7 % in the third quarter and 17 % in the fourth quarter), which forced the firm to make redundancies in Brittany, Franche-Comté, Île-de-France, Alsace and Lorraine. The EGF is based on a proactive policy because it offers careers advice and training for workers who have been made redundant, and it finances allowances for redeployment leave and setting up a business.</p>

Today’s report deals with a request for support for 2 089 redundancies, all of which are targeted for assistance, which took place in Peugeot Citroën over four months (1 November 2009 to 28 February 2010) for a total amount of EUR 11 949 666.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported this request. One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. The French authorities argue that the increasingly bleak growth prospects and the tougher credit conditions during the crisis have given rise to fears among private individuals concerning the safety of their jobs and have led them to postpone purchasing a vehicle. At the same time, given the deterioration in the economic situation, companies have also cut down on investments and, consequently, on renewals of their fleet of vehicles. Thus, despite the temporary measures introduced by some Member States (for example, scrapping programmes), the European vehicle market – particularly in Western Europe, which is the largest market for the group PSA Peugeot Citroën – collapsed suddenly in the second half of 2008, with a 10.7 % decrease in registrations of light passenger and commercial vehicles in Europe in the third quarter and a 17 % decrease in the fourth quarter of 2008, in relation to the same period over the previous year. The fall in the sales of vehicles due to the global financial and economic crisis has directly affected the economic results of the PSA Peugeot Citroën group.</p>

The second quarter of 2009 saw a 39.5 % drop in the total number of vehicles manufactured in the EU in relation to the previous year, so the main European manufacturers, and their suppliers, are experiencing enormous difficulties. The French car industry is particularly affected by the crisis because it has experienced a bigger drop in competitiveness than other European countries, and this situation forced PSA Peugeot Citroën to make more than 2 000 people redundant in various regions. To help them, France requested assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which may be mobilised in the event of redundancies linked to the economic and financial crisis. With my vote for this resolution, I am calling for EUR 11.9 million to be released to help the PSA Peugeot Citroën employees who lost their jobs.

It is intended to mitigate the social effect caused by 720 redundancies in the wind turbine manufacturer Vestas Group (NACE Revision 2 Division 28 – ‘Manufacture of machinery and equipment’). Given that, according to the Commission’s conclusions, the application meets the necessary and sufficient conditions for deploying the EGF, I voted in favour of this proposal for a decision.</p>

      <p sl="en">This request is the 13th application submitted under the 2012 budget and refers to the mobilisation of a total amount of EUR 7 488 000 from the EGF for Denmark. The application concerns 720 redundancies in wind turbine manufacturer Vestas Group. Ironically, one of Europe’s largest renewable energy groups is making hundreds of workers redundant at a time when the EU claims that this is a priority area under its Europe 2020 strategy. This is food for thought, and in fact sheds light on the real meaning and objectives of that strategy. Despite wind turbine production in Europe having increased in recent years, and despite the foreseeable increase in the needs of the Asian, North American and South American markets, the solution adopted has not been to build on the loyalty of the European market and conquer new markets, but to dismiss highly skilled workers and relocate production and services outside Europe. This has left behind another trail of poverty in the municipalities of Midtjylland and Syddanmark, where in February of this year 76 430 people were already unemployed.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Danish authorities responsible for this EGF application argued that the European wind turbine industry was seriously impacted by changes in world trade patterns and a major drop in EU market share. Indeed, Denmark is to be complimented for starting the implementation of support measures ahead of the final decision on its EGF application, in order to provide workers with quick and timely assistance. Vestas employed many high-skilled workers and I hope that the EGF funding will be used to ensure that their skills sets are successfully reutilised for the continued benefit of Denmark’s already-impressive renewable energy sector. The total estimated cost of the package is approximately EUR 15 million, of which the EGF would provide almost half, i.e. EUR 7.4 million.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this proposal. To this avail, the Danish authorities argue that the wind turbine manufacturing industry in the EU, which is included in NACE Revision 2 Division 28 (‘Manufacture of machinery and equipment’), has been seriously affected by changes in world trade patterns, in particular a significant reduction of the EU market share. Denmark explains that, although the European production of wind turbines has increased in the past few years, the global market for wind turbines has developed even faster, especially in Asia and North America. For the first time in 2010, more than half of all new wind power capacities were added outside the traditional markets of Europe and North America. This development was mainly driven by the continuing economic boom in China, which accounted for half of the new global wind installations. As a result of the dynamic global growth of the sector, Europe’s share in total capacity was reduced from 65.5 % in 2006 to 43.7 % in 2010.</p>

It is clear that the adverse consequences of globalisation further highlight the added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as an EU social policy tool. The targeted financial support which it provides for retraining and reintegration programmes for workers affected by mass dismissals is particularly important. The support which it provides is a practical expression of EU solidarity. The case of Denmark is the best demonstration of the fact that this financial instrument does not confine its operation to countries facing economic and budgetary challenges, but may prove equally useful in helping dismissed workers to reintegrate into the labour market even in economically robust countries.

While it is always a tragedy to have a large workforce face redundancy and a sad indictment of the economic woes in which Europe finds itself, it is my belief that the EU has been part architect of the current situation through austerity and cuts that have killed consumer confidence and exacerbated the economic crisis. The EU should therefore not be in a position to pour money into its failings. The EU is an outdated model that is not fit for purpose in a globalised market place. National bodies should have full jurisdiction over trade and employment and forge partnerships with third countries to manage in times of crisis and provide for their workforce in both good and bad times.

The application concerns 2 177 redundancies in Manroland AG and 62 in two of its subsidiaries, as well as 45 in one supplier (Gefinal Systema), making a total of 2 284 redundancies, of which 2 239 occurred during the four-month reference period from 1 January 2012 to 30 April 2012. The redundancies in Manroland AG and its subsidiaries were calculated in accordance with the second indent of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EC No 1927/2006, while those in Gefinal Systema were calculated in accordance with the first indent of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006.</p>

      <p sl="it">Germany has requested assistance for the redundancies in the printing machinery manufacturer Manroland AG. The break-up of a large enterprise such as Manroland AG has led to a great number of redundancies and a loss of skills affecting the regions concerned. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has shown itself to be an effective instrument for assisting workers who have been made redundant. The amounts mobilised will be used to cofinance active labour market measures including personalised services aimed at reintegrating the workers in the labour market, training courses leading to qualifications, updating of skills and retraining, and short-term incentives and allowances. The EGF should be mobilised to assist the enterprise in order to ensure that the skills and competences gained throughout professional careers are not wasted. I therefore voted in favour.</p>

It is clear that the adverse consequences of globalisation further highlight the added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as an EU social policy tool. The targeted financial support which it provides for retraining and reintegration programmes for workers affected by mass dismissals is particularly important. Furthermore, the support which it provides is a practical expression of EU solidarity. The case of Germany is the best demonstration of the fact that this financial instrument does not confine its operation to countries facing economic and budgetary challenges, but may prove equally useful in helping dismissed workers to reintegrate into the labour market even in economically robust countries. This in turn underlines the importance of that Fund, and shows how necessary it is that it should continue to operate for the duration of the forthcoming multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>

In recent years the European Union has taken various steps to prevent these dual-use items (which can be used for both civilian and military purposes) from being used to manufacture weapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction. The main instrument of EU control is Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, which covers the brokering and transit of these items, but which needs amending in order to avoid different treatment depending on the Member State.

Currently, the Regulation is updated through the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission proposes to introduce delegated acts for regular updates of Annex I and modifications of Annex II.

Although decisions of international export control regimes are legally non-binding, international commitments undertaken by Member States mean, that frequent updates to the EU dual-use export control list are required and important. Such updates must, in view of their impact on security and trade, be included regularly and in good time in EU legislation. In the event that international export control regimes decide to include new items in the control lists, such supplementary items must be constantly controlled throughout the EU for security reasons. Furthermore, a decision by the international export control regimes to de-control certain items must also be included in EU legislation as quickly as possible so that exporters from the EU are competitive on world markets. In view of the rapid rate of development in the world, it is essential to ensure that current EU General Export Authorisations can be promptly amended with respect to their destinations and range of items.

      <p sl="pt">It is vitally important that crews on board ships have a minimum level of training to ensure their safety at sea and in port. It should be guaranteed that seafarers performing the same duties have the same level of skills needed to ensure the same performance, even where they have been trained in another Member State. Training and certification of seafarers are regulated by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), which was adopted in 1978 by the International Maritime Organisation. The STCW Convention was amended in 2010 in Manila, with these amendments having entered into force on 1 January 2012. It is vital that the amendments agreed in Manila are coherently transposed into EU law through the amendment of Directive 2008/106/EC. In order to avoid compromising safety on board ships, the opinion advocates an essential minimum rest period for seafarers. I therefore support this proposal, which seeks to prevent the danger posed by fatigue by not allowing exceptions to the daily rest period. Exceptions will only be allowed if social partners in the different Member States agree to a lower weekly rest period than 77 hours.</p>

Portugal has the technical and administrative capacity to meet the new training requirements. However, it must be ensured that the minimum training requirements do not fall behind current technological developments and scientific progress, which we fear is not the case. The proposal also stipulates a minimum number of rest hours and minimum ages for young candidates, and minimum compulsory requirements for certification as ratings. However, in Portugal the intensity of work on board is already high, and is tending to increase further due to the trend towards reducing the number of personnel. It should have been ensured that these workers do not work more than eight hours, which this report has not managed to achieve.</p>

The European Parliament had limited room for manoeuvre, since the Member States had already accepted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). These changes constitute progress on training and the harmonisation of the issue of certificates of competency. They also improve the prevention of fraudulent practices and the standards applied in respect of fitness to work, medical requirements and requirements concerning alcohol abuse. In a sector which operates without borders, it is in the interests of seafarers, as well as in the general interest, for the certificates issued by Member States and third countries to be recognised everywhere in Europe. However, to avoid a ‘race to the bottom’, it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of strict common criteria remain in place. We can be satisfied that this is the case. I also welcome the Commission’s initiative of obliging Member States to communicate the available information on certificates, an appropriate provision which will help establish an overall picture of the current state of affairs and a strategy for employment in the sector.</p>

Europe is the world’s leading maritime power and its maritime industry is one of the jewels in our crown, creating jobs and serving as a vector for growth. It is clearly important to maintain our maritime know-how, particularly as the competitiveness of the sector depends on the quality of training given to seafarers. The IMO is the appropriate body to establish regulations on this matter, given the international nature of maritime transport. The fact that the Member States and the Commission sit on this body is a measure of the trust placed in its expertise. Recent disasters have led to a strengthening of the quality of training on onboard security, and I have insisted on the need for crew members to have access to procedures and documents in their own language on the operation of the vessels and on emergency situations. I also advocated a stringent approach to the procedures for issuing and checking seafarers’ certificates. Maritime safety and security are too important for us not to lead by example, and I am therefore pleased with the consensus Parliament has reached.</p>

The seas have long offered many benefits and resources to our Union, thus it is vital that we continue to make the seas safe for everyone. This directive covers the safety and training of the seafarers and imposes the international laws of the STCW into EU law. Simply put, it puts the EU on a par with the rest of the seafarers around the world by incorporating the laws that already exist into EU legislation. We have accounted for our high standard of protecting the identity of our seafarers as well as increased safety measures to equate with our higher standard of protecting the workers.

It comes just a few days after Israel advanced into new settlements, in flagrant breach of international law and innumerable United Nations resolutions. Violations of human rights are occurring on a daily basis in the Occupied Territories, from where some of the products covered by this Protocol may come. The EU is turning a blind eye and putting business first. This policy of double standards becomes clearly apparent when you consider the human rights violations cited in order to impose various types of sanctions on other states, such as the recent case of Iran, where the ‘nuclear threat’ was also cited.

While Israel, with total disregard for and in defiance of the Union’s positions, continues to systematically destroy the conditions for a peace agreement, giving it this commercial ‘gift’ is clearly not evidence of coherence.</p>

A compromise solution might be to include in the Protocol only a vague reference as regards the territories in which the Protocol must be applied. This is called ‘constructive vagueness’. The view of the EU is that a Palestinian state should be established on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is a political opinion and lacks any basis in international law. Palestine has never existed historically and the Palestinian people are a political projection that lacks any ethnic basis. The only possibility for creating a Palestinian state would be if the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) entered into an agreement with Israel, and the PLO is not prepared to do this. This should not be allowed to influence the EU’s activities. The EU wrongly asserts that East Jerusalem and the West Bank are ‘occupied Palestinian territories’. The Mandate for Palestine made provision for the creation of closed Jewish settlements in Jerusalem and on the western flank of the River Jordan, in other words on the West Bank too. Hence the settlements established by Israel do not contravene international law, but only EU political and legislative resolutions, which, conversely, do contravene international law.

One of the objectives of the Commission is to promote sustainable development, considering that, from a financial, regulatory, administrative, and social point of view, the setting up of microbusinesses and SMEs in developing countries, in order to boost entrepreneurship and development of the private sector, is essential for creating favourable business environments in developing countries. The EU should focus on reducing excessive regulatory burdens on SMEs and microbusinesses, and, in this context, should encourage and further strengthen access to microcredit and microfinancing. I congratulate Mr Goerens on his excellent work, both in terms of its long-term vision and the quality of the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Support to developing countries has always been one of the European Union’s flagship policies. It is the leading donor of financial development aid given that it provides half of all this aid. Many countries having benefited from this support are now emerging economies which no longer need the EU’s assistance. At this time of economic and financial crisis, the EU must redirect its support to the poorest countries, by gradually withdrawing assistance from countries with emerging economies. The European Agenda must be adapted to this new situation in order to continue the fight to eradicate global poverty and achieve the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. We must properly assess this whole issue and look carefully at every euro that is spent, as the shortage of resources means that we must all pay closer attention to preventing waste and maximising investments. I voted in favour of this report on ‘an Agenda for Change: the future of EU development policy’ because I consider that the EU must continue working to eradicate global poverty by channelling its support, not to the governments of developing countries, but to the people and organisations directly involved in this process.</p>

      <p sl="en">This own-initiative report is based on the Commission’s communication on ‘an Agenda for Change’, in which changes are announced to development cooperation policy. Over its 15 pages, the report contains both positive and negative aspects. The idea that the implementation of development policy should contribute first and foremost to combating poverty and exclusion is a cross-cutting approach. Important (but inadequate) consideration is given to the problem of food security, to the right of developing countries to regulate investment (particularly foreign investment), to the central role that public aid must continue to play, and to the need to assess the results of cooperation policy, among other issues. Furthermore, the trend towards an instrumental view of cooperation policy, involving its export to developing countries and the imposition of models in the plan for the state’s economic and social organisation, is undeniable. The assertions on market economy and the conditionality of assistance form part of this trend. Lastly, the references to tax havens, tax evasion and capital flight are totally inadequate. The same is true of the problem of policy coherence, which is insufficiently tackled.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Since the Millennium Development Goals were adopted in 2000, the major changes already apparent at the time have become more evident. Above all, globalisation, boosted by more liberalised world trade, has become an impressive source of wealth creation. This fact on the one hand reduces inequalities between countries, while, on the other, increasing them inside all of them, including the industrialised countries. In this context, the Commission places particular emphasis on the quality of the assistance. Moreover, it is justified in believing that greater selectivity is called for when it comes to choosing partner countries. This would result in the elimination of some emerging countries from the list of beneficiaries of European Official Development Assistance. With the ‘Agenda for Change’, the EU seeks to become the best donor, while also making efforts to excel in three areas: governance, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and the development of social protection systems in developing countries. I also consider it no less important that all other donors also make intensive efforts in the field of common programming.</p>

      <p sl="hu">More than half of all of the money spent on helping the poor countries of the world currently comes from the European Union and its Member States. For this reason EU development policy must be treated as an issue of special importance. In my opinion the report presented by the rapporteur, Mr Goerens, contains many innovative points and advances the fundamental goal of EU development policy, namely the long term elimination of poverty. I too agree that EU trade facilitation instruments must not focus solely on developing countries’ export sectors, but must be targeted at facilitating trade for local and regional markets too. In terms of promoting inclusive growth and increasing the effectiveness of aid, there is great promise in the innovative approach whereby from now on loans agreed for a developing country will not be classified as official development aid in donor countries unless an ex-post assessment can confirm that the loan in question has in fact helped to reduce poverty. In developing countries there is a great need to boost entrepreneurship and private sector development, and this report is right to highlight the need to create favourable business environments for SMEs and microenterprises and the importance of access to credit. I am pleased that the report sets out the need for a well-coordinated, consistent policy for Member States and other European cooperation actors and calls for the creation of an independent think-tank with analytical and advisory abilities to meet this need. Because of these innovative approaches I voted in favour of this report on development policy.</p>

The report by Charles Goerens suggests a number of practical ways of achieving this objective. For instance, the rapporteur proposes that there should be greater selectivity when it comes to choosing partners, that more detailed criteria should be set with regard to the budget envelope and public development aid, and that inclusive growth and the role of economic growth in developing countries, which are a driving force for social progress, should be taken into account.</p>

They wanted: 1. an end to EU protectionism, which harms farmers and African entrepreneurs exporting to the EU; 2. to stop EU Member States’ support of corrupt regimes; and 3. aid for short-term disaster relief, although they were suspicious of long term development aid. Some were even against foreign aid altogether – especially direct budgetary support – since they felt it helped to keep corrupt governments in power. They suggested that any aid should focus on: 1. helping farmers to meet EU sanitary and phytosanitary standards; 2. building infrastructure which the private sector cannot finance; 3. developing robust legal systems, e.g. legal advice, training for lawyers and judges, legal staff, court recorders, documentation, etc.; 4. drawing up land &amp; property registers, allowing citizens to register property and raise capital; 5. creating a system of mortgage finance to create property-owning democracies; 6. lending capital to entrepreneurs who are unable to access larger banks; 7. improving tax collection and government revenue systems to reduce reliance on import tariffs; and 8. training local politicians and civil servants for trade negotiations.

      <p sl="ga">This is not the first time we have discussed here in Parliament the importance of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. The biggest problem facing SMEs is how and where to access funding and small loans. I understand, from small enterprises in my local area, that very little progress has been made. The competitiveness and growth of the European Union could be enhanced on the basis of our SMEs, which employ 75 million people throughout Europe, but for that to happen the EU must implement a number of tough measures to tackle the problems facing the sector. I support the proposal for a ‘mapping exercise’ of the local, regional, national and European support schemes to help SMEs secure funding, in particular initiatives facilitating access to loans for micro-enterprises. We have to match our words with actions, reducing red tape and simplifying administration. We should apply the ‘one in, one out’ principle to single market legislation. This means that no new legislation that imposes costs on SMEs can be brought in without the identification of existing regulations within a given field and of an equivalent value that can be removed.</p>

      <p sl="en">In Europe there are approximately 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which represent 99 % of all businesses and employ around 75 million people. Bearing in mind the impact that these enterprises have on the European economy, it is important that policy makers look for opportunities to exploit the dynamism within the sector to the wider benefit of European society. In order for the European Union economy to be pushed back to growth, the EU must adopt measures able to reduce the administrative burdens that SMEs encounter. This report, which merited my support, advocates reinforcing industrial and SME competitiveness, which requires an environment that favours new ideas and new businesses. The EU should also encourage its SMEs to go international, mainly in the new emerging markets, and therefore stresses the need to reduce some of the substantial obstacles faced by these businesses when they attempt to launch themselves on the global market. Lastly, the need for the Commission to continue and reinforce programmes such as ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’ and the need to study the possibility of creating a programme in order to give talented entrepreneurs the opportunity to acquire experience in centres of excellence outside the EU are also supported.</p>

I therefore welcome the contents of this report and in particular the emphasis on the importance of carrying out a mapping of programmes inside and outside the Union in order to provide SMEs with an up-to-date framework of the services available. A European strategy alone, regardless of how ambitious and well-structured it is, will not be sufficient to bring about significant changes. It must be accompanied by strong action to provide better information to SMEs in order to raise awareness of EU support services for internationalisation. Among tools for better information, a central role will be played by the new online portal that should provide constantly updated information about priority markets and sectors together with details of the various support services available. I also agree with the report’s underlining of the need for better coordination and synergy between different European, national, regional and local polices and instruments directly addressing SMEs: fragmentation must be reduced in order to ensure greater pooling and coordination of financial resources available at the various levels.</p>

Public procurement is one of the effective methods of supporting domestic small and medium enterprises in achieving technical innovations and providing for the growth needed for them to engage in internationalisation. I expect the Commission to take an initiative to ensure that EU small and medium enterprises have access to public procurement on third country markets on an equal footing with other companies. I hope that the recently published motion for a regulation on the EU public procurement market will support reciprocal openness, which would benefit EU small and medium enterprises. In this respect, the EU should develop an ambitious common industrial policy based on support for research and innovation using quite new financing arrangements, such as project bonds, and supporting the development of small and medium enterprises, particularly through access to public procurement, in order that they maintain their competitiveness vis-à-vis new major players in industry and research.

In this context I could also mention the online portals for EU SMEs proposed by Mr Rübig, which would enable programmes targeted at SMEs to operate more effectively.

The suggestions contained in this resolution will go a long way, if implemented, to helping SMEs help the European economy on the road to recovery and prosperity. If every SME in the EU added one more staff member to their books, the unemployment crisis would disappear overnight, so it is incumbent on us across all sectors to provide an SME-friendly environment, particularly in relation to COSME, Horizon 2020 and access to credit.</p>

      <p sl="ro">SMEs are the backbone of the economy and an important factor in development, research and innovation that may result in job creation and increased EU competitiveness overall. Unfortunately, they are also the most affected by low competitiveness due to reduced market adaptability and limited access to capital, technology and infrastructure. That is why we must prioritise their development and facilitate their access to financing. SMEs must be considered eligible partners for Cohesion Fund investments and must benefit from supplementary funding in the next programming period for 2014-2020. In order to progress, SMEs should create partnerships with similar organisations and universities.</p>

That is why it is natural to support this report regardless of any controversial aspect that are obviously the result of compromises between political groups. However, there can be no argument over the common conviction that without strong and competitive SMEs Europe will lose its economic prospects. We welcome the efforts to make SMEs more international by creating a multilingual on-line portal that would help entrepreneurs to become quickly and easily informed of the relevant legislation in third countries. We also welcome the Commission’s intention to create a map of the local, regional and national networks for assisting SMEs in Europe. Above all, we welcome all efforts to ease the bureaucratic burden on SMEs. This report and its recommendations undoubtedly represent a crucial step in this direction. Growth and new jobs are what we most need today, and the statistics showing that this is exactly what the SME sector offers more than any other. Therefore, every new attempt by the European institutions to improve the business environment for SMEs must be supported.</p>

In my opinion, an effective recovery from the present crisis should be achieved by boosting the competitiveness of industry, the existence of which is largely dependent on SMEs. We must therefore create the right conditions for implementing innovative solutions in existing and newly emerging businesses. Unfortunately, the EU lacks a coherent and coordinated industrial policy. Human capital is also vital to successful businesses, and closely tied to improvements in their performance. An appropriately implemented, and above all, rational administrative and fiscal policy will also help SMEs, and, consequently, the entire European Union economy, to achieve more rapid growth.</p>

Only 25 % of EU SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market while only 13 % have been internationally active outside the EU.

The opportunity for future business growth outside the EU and especially in the new emerging countries is high, even though, because of the large number of small firms that are tied to local business, the unfulfilled potential within Europe’s SME sector to go international should not be exaggerated.</p>

For the S&amp;D Group it is problematic to accept a premise of the Commission thinking – namely those SMEs and micro-enterprises should be exempt from European legislation on health and safety at work and on workers’ rights. Amendments in committee stressed that health and safety at work and workers’ protection cannot be considered administrative burdens, and that fundamental workers’ rights and occupational safety and health should not be jeopardised by the reduction of documentation and reporting obligations.

Despite the fact that the administrative burden of businesses has dropped year by year, the Member States are facing serious problems in transposing EU legislation which causes an increase in administrative burden and costs. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways of implementing legislation more effectively to avoid duplication and the redirecting of operators between various authorities, which entail excessive costs. The purpose of bureaucracy should be the efficiency and development of the whole of society rather than merely the establishment of social positions for officials. In order to enhance the entrepreneurial spirit of individuals – I agree with the rapporteur – the EU should invest more in action plans aimed at introducing to citizens, especially young people and women, the nature of entrepreneurship and the alternatives to employment that it provides. The very foundation of the European economy should above all be enterprising individuals, and expanding the administrative structures is not the solution here.</p>

In this proposal, the European Parliament calls upon the Commission and the Member States to show even greater decisiveness in this direction.

In this context, I would like to spell out once again what I regard as the essential feature of good advice services for those of our SMEs that wish to do business in overseas markets. A multilingual online portal containing legislation and information, as proposed by the Commission and Mr Rübig, would certainly be helpful provided that it is user-friendly. However, this can only ever be an add-on. What we need, first and foremost, are advisory services for businesses at the local level. Doing business internationally is a major risk for many firms, and to take this step, they must have confidence in their partners. This is created through the provision of advice services locally – not at the EU level or, indeed, in the third country markets – by organisations such as the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), which are already familiar to SMEs. The trusted partners must in turn have partners who they can trust in the third countries which are companies’ target markets.

It is very strange that this report says absolutely nothing about this aspect, and therefore neglects the real problems facing SMEs. Furthermore, it continues to use the internal market excuse when it is clearly apparent that it was precisely the monopolistic concentration in certain sectors of the economy, which were possible due to the free movement of goods and capital, that condemned many SMEs to disaster and bankruptcy.

The US and the EU are very important trade partners: the two economies together account for about half of the global economic output and nearly a third of world trade flows, making this relationship the largest economic relationship in the world. Although the economic ties between the EU and the US are among the most open in the world, there is a general consensus that the potential of the transatlantic relationship is far from being fully exploited. Therefore it is important to foster the ongoing joint discussion between the EU and the US on how to work collectively to increase growth potential and financial stability. I support the rapporteur’s view that, in order to ensure long-term prosperity and employment, a joint commitment and effort is needed to create new opportunities for businesses both large and small, to promote entrepreneurship and to capitalise on the advantages offered by the uniquely integrated transatlantic market. In this regard, we, Members of the EP, emphasise that there are many areas where progress would be greatly beneficial, such as the removal of trade barriers and better market access.</p>

To achieve this, one of the most ambitious goals of the European Union’s trade strategy, it will be necessary to remove numerous technical obstacles and overcome unnecessary differences and excessively rigid regulatory requirements between these two parts of the world.

Elimination of tariff barriers is important for the strengthening of economic relations between the EU and the United States, provided this does not have adverse effects on the remaining strategic sectors of the European economy. For the purposes of future negotiations, I would like to draw immediate attention to combating the so-called ‘Italian sounding’ phenomenon. In 2009, according to recent official estimates, for every eight Italian-inspired products sold in US supermarkets only one was actually produced in our country. I therefore call on the European Commission, in the context of a free trade agreement, to take steps to ensure better protection of European food products, and in particular Italian products because they are more affected by counterfeiting, as well as greater efforts by the US to combat this phenomenon.</p>

Under the current system of trademark registration in the US, which prefers to protect registered trademarks rather than indications of origin, the so-called ‘Italian sounding’ phenomenon has evolved, which misleads foreign consumers and causes enormous economic damage to the exports of our enterprises, especially in the agro-food sector. Other areas where the report considers that agreement between the partners would be greatly beneficial include: the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets to ensure full reciprocity since European small and medium-sized enterprises are currently operating at a considerable disadvantage in this area, and the convergence on mutual recognition of regulatory standards.</p>

Despite transatlantic flows of trade and investment being quite considerable, the potential of the EU-US relationship is far from being fully exploited. I support this report by Vital Moreira because I consider that there is huge potential for the two economies to intensify their trade relations: they both share common values, similar legal systems and very similar labour, energy and market standards, based on which fruitful agreements and synergies can be developed. While the specific interests and sensitivities of both partners must be safeguarded (such as European policies and guidelines on the environment, hygiene and animal welfare, food safety, cultural diversity, social rights, etc.), there are many areas where intensifying relations would be a win-win deal, in particular regarding the removal of trade barriers, the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets, and the clarification, simplification and harmonisation of rules of origin. Given the increasing importance of e-commerce, in my opinion it is also essential to intensify relations with regard to the data protection standards that are crucial in protecting customers both in the EU and the US.</p>

It welcomes the commitment ‘to open trade and investment, expand markets and resist protectionism in all its forms, which are necessary conditions for sustained global economic recovery, jobs and development’. This is the usual list of arguments for the marvels of free trade, on which they keep insisting, even though reality continues to contradict their wonderful promises and make the true consequences of this approach ever more apparent: namely, unemployment, business closure (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises), monopolistic concentration, pressure on the workforce resulting in their devaluation, and increased pressure on the environment and natural resources. The aspects in relation to opening up the market in services and public procurement should also be highlighted, as they are particularly worrying. Further attacks on public services are being lined up, with private capital advancing into ever more new areas of social life, so that it can engage in accumulation processes in an attempt to counteract the ever-deepening crisis.</p>

The EU and the US economies together account for around half the entire world GDP and for almost a third of world trade flows. Mutual investment is more than EUR 2.1 trillion. Total US investment in the EU is three times higher than its investment in all of Asia. Equally, the EU’s investment in the US is estimated to be eight times the amount of EU investment in India and China taken together. There are also roughly 15 million jobs linked to the transatlantic economy. It is estimated that a third of the trade across the Atlantic actually consists of intra-company transfers. There are issues that can get in the way of other trade agreements such as labour and environment standards, which should not be obstacles to an EU-US trade agreement.

I have reservations about the effects of a complete cancellation of export refunds in EU-US agricultural trade, which warrants its own detailed study.</p>

      <p sl="en">This own-initiative report emphasises, with appropriate realism and without ignoring the contextual difficulties, the huge potential benefits of a comprehensive trade agreement. It is a balanced proposal, based on reciprocity, in which both parties will emerge winners if the agreement is successfully concluded, as it aims to encourage bilateral relations between the two powers and will ultimately stimulate world trade, by forming new multilateral links that are currently being held back within the World Trade Organisation. With the hope that the many technical disputes will be resolved by the end of the year, particularly with regard to dealing with the divergences and burdensome regulatory regimes, the report finally wishes for a favourable response in relation to these two negotiations.

Following careful and thorough preparation and consultation, negotiations should be launched in the first half of 2013, building on the present political momentum, and on the support of industry, to enable a swift and successful conclusion to the negotiations. It is essential that all stakeholders representing the business communities, once these negotiations have been opened, organise themselves in such a way as to provide maximum support, in a coordinated, broad-based manner, to underpin an open, transparent dialogue to make progress on the initiative.</p>

Our main goal at this stage is to go against the hype of a fast-tracked FTA which almost certainly will result in failure and damage US-EU relations even further. The obstacles for regulatory convergences and service liberalisation in particular are so high that we demand a much more precise elaboration of what shall be negotiated. Therefore, we want the HLWG to take all of the time it needs to make a sound proposal of possible deliveries of any kind of trade agreement, after thorough consultations with all stakeholders. We also warn against the hype that a comprehensive transatlantic FTA could become the maker of new global trade rules, which we regard as a serious threat to the survival of the multilateral trade system as embodied by the WTO. Except for a couple of our amendments which were included in compromise texts, especially a hint to the very different perceptions of the role and function of public services and services of general interest, we lost all our amendments in the committee vote.

I therefore particularly welcome the report’s emphasis on the need to resolve this issue.

      <p sl="pl">The European Union and the United States have always been important trade partners, while the United States aided the development of European countries in the years following the Second World War. Together, the US and EU economies currently account for approximately half of global economic output and their combined trade flows for nearly one-third of global turnover. Consequently, Europe and the United States enjoy the largest economic relationship in the world. Unfortunately, these relations do not yet extend to harmonised regulatory standards, which presents a significant barrier that is particularly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises – on which our growth and employment must be based – to surmount. Moreover, in view of the ongoing financial crisis, we must strengthen our relationship, as it is the only way out of the crisis. As stressed by the World Trade Organisation, the open and multilateral trading system in use among WTO member countries is the best means of stimulating growth and improving the welfare of people around the world and we must hold onto that if we wish to defeat the crisis. Another important issue is that of agricultural trade, in particular as regards the recently announced US Farm Bill. The rules on subsidies in the United States differ from those set out in the European common agricultural policy, but are just as high. It is also worthwhile focusing on geographical indications of origin in the context of bilateral trade in agricultural products, which could increase access to the agricultural markets of the EU and United States.</p>

However, there is a general consensus on both sides of the Atlantic that the relationship between these two blocks could be intensified. In 2009, according to the Commission, the existence of non-tariff barriers to trade translated into losses of EUR 163 billion for both economies, excluding their potential growth in gross domestic product. Consequently, there is huge potential for socioeconomic development and growth, which could come from a trade agreement between these partners. I agree with the rapporteur that this potential trade agreement should involve the total or almost total removal of tariffs, mutual recognition or harmonisation of technical standards, reciprocal rules, opening of the public procurement market, and so on.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time we have met to discuss this issue, although it may be the first time that we have met at this hour. The question now arising, slowly but surely, is this: when will our debate about data retention finally be at an end? A great many Member States and their constitutional courts have decided that it is not compatible with national constitutions. The Irish High Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, and countless citizens in the Member States have not only expressed disquiet and incomprehension about data retention but reject it outright.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hate to say it, but our assessment all those years ago, when this issue was first discussed in 2005, was correct. We have legal issues which are unresolved; we have economic issues relating to data retention which are unresolved; and we have technical issues which are unresolved. Above all, we have social issues which are unresolved. The Commission’s evaluation report clearly showed the extent to which the approach to data retention, procedures and use vary between the Member States. In some countries, for example, the coastguard can access dossiers of retained data; in others, authorities can make a verbal request. The evaluation report also showed that everything has been achieved, except for harmonisation on issues of data retention. The question whether it is needed at all is still unanswered.</p>
      <p sl="de">In that sense, the authors are rightly asking when we can expect a new initiative from the Commission. It is time to stop flogging a dead horse, which is what data retention is. I would hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss a reform before the end of this legislative term and, in particular, to hear the Commission’s proposals during this debate. I hope we will find out more this evening.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not want to speak for too long, so let me finish by saying this: I am sure you will have noticed from my comments that we are all getting very tired of this issue. I personally would greatly welcome it if we could find a solution to this sorry state of affairs at European level and perhaps even deal with the issue in an objective manner.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance actually has a very simple question for you, Ms Malmström. When can we expect the revision of the Data Retention Directive? Your answer could actually be very simple too: ‘very soon, Ms Sargentini, because Parliament has been waiting for it for some time’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am afraid though that you are not going to give me that answer and you seem to have put the revision of the Directive on the back burner. The reason for this is rather harsh, I think, and it is that the Member States cannot prove that the Data Retention Directive is useful, but they are also reluctant to give up the right to store our telecoms and internet data. In fact, they want to retain that right.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is no European law that violates privacy on such a large scale as this law, which stores European citizens’ data without them being under suspicion, without obtaining permission from a court and without demonstrable results. While you dawdle over the revision of the retention obligation, you have dragged Germany before the European Court because it refuses to comply with this law. If no one can prove that it works, it is time to abolish the Directive on storing data traffic and to replace it with an alternative, a quick freeze for example, where a court is involved and where we record and store part of the data, targeting a specific suspect. Targeted investigations, judicial control and no unnecessary violation of privacy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, Ms Malmström, once again, please confront those Member States, remember what we saw with ACTA, that there are many people in Europe who cherish their privacy, who are willing to use activism and who can help you to change these governments’ minds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy that this debate on the revision of the 2006 Directive is taking place, even if it is late, it is a little cold in here and some of us are hungry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a debate that we have a duty to hold on behalf of the citizens, who are increasingly asking questions about how their personal data is used in a number of fields. This Directive is particularly controversial in a number of regards, as shown by the repeals of the German, Czech and Romanian transposing legislation by the competent constitutional courts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is at issue here? The main problem is the intrusive nature of the Directive with regard to privacy and data protection. While there is clearly no question of challenging the benefits of collecting connection data for criminal investigation purposes, some issues, in particular those raised by the European Data Protection Supervisor, remain topical as long as there is no proposal for a revision on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would therefore like the Commissioner to provide some answers to assuage the concerns that I think we share on a number of points, such as the need for a clear demonstration that such a system is necessary and proportional, compliance with the principle of legitimate purpose, which, as we know, is currently used extensively by some Member States, and, finally, possible ways of keeping data in a less intrusive way than at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here, as in many other debates, we must find a balance, however difficult that may be, between security imperatives and the protection of freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a society where information and communication technologies are omnipresent, the protection of personal data, which is a fundamental right, must be strengthened and must not remain a purely theoretical right enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this is a never-ending story. I have lost count of the times we have discussed it here. It is a shameful situation that it takes an oral question today to elicit information from the Commission about what it plans to do next with regard to data retention. Let me be frank: instead of deluding itself, the Commission should stop playing games and should face up to reality. That includes admitting that data retention has failed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s aim of establishing uniform rules is quite simply misguided. One reason is that some Member States, due to their constitutional arrangements, are not in a position to transpose the European Directive. What’s more, we have a patchwork of arrangements in the other countries which have transposed the Directive. Some countries store data for six months, others for a year. Some only use the data when investigating serious crime; others use the data to investigate minor delictions. It is a terrible mess, and I do not think we have ever seen anything like it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now you are taking action against the German Government by referring the matter to the European Court of Justice. Curiously, you argue that Germany’s failure to transpose the Directive is likely to have a negative effect on the internal market and on the ability of the German police to investigate and prosecute serious crime. What did you get that from? How did you come up with that? No one can possibly know whether that claim is true. In fact, studies have revealed a very different picture. The available information includes not only the judgments of the courts and related studies. They also include activity reports such as those produced by the German Bundestag’s Research Services, which is genuinely above suspicion. In 2011, the Research Services found no significant evidence that data retention offers any benefits for the investigation of crime. The reports such as that produced by the Max Planck Institute in 2012 are also beyond reproach. That report states that data retention is of no use whatsoever in the investigation of murders, robberies, child pornography and internet crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say this, Ms Malmström. If the Commission has nothing new to contribute here, you should at least suspend the Directive pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Aside from that, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the retention of communications data where there is no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.</p>

    <intervention id="2-601-000" speaker_id="96761" name="Axel Voss" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the tragic case of 15-year-old Amanda Todd from Canada a few days ago has shown us once again that there are some forms of behaviour on the internet which are harmful to other people. In this particular instance, it was cyber bullying, which is on the increase here in Europe as well. However, it is also about combating internet-based terrorism, crime in general and child abuse in particular, organised crime, right-wing extremism, and phishing. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime has now spoken out in favour of international standards for data retention. Of course, overall, we need to achieve a balance between fundamental rights and sound law enforcement by government authorities. In the case of Amanda Todd, the Anonymous hackers’ group has pledged to identify the bullies, but this kind of vigilante justice on the internet is not what we want either.</p>
      <p sl="de">So those who say that data retention must be abolished are oversimplifying the matter. The same applies to those who are opposed to data retention but offer no solutions to the problem or fail to take proper account of the rights of the victims of internet crime. In my view, successful investigations, such as the identification of the person responsible for the attack in Toulouse, demonstrate the need for data storage and for data retention.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its present form, the Directive does not yet appear to have achieved the balance that is necessary. That may be why it seems so important to bring forward a new and improved proposal based on the recommendations made in the 2011 evaluation.</p>
      <p sl="de">More generally, however, it is completely unacceptable for the unity of European law, or indeed compliance with European law in this matter to be completely undermined by the German Justice Minister. Only last Monday, the Parliamentary State Secretary in Germany’s Federal Ministry of Justice stated during a meeting of the Petitions Committee that the German Government would not bring forward a proposal for the transposition of the Data Retention Directive. Until the issues of transposition and the reform of the Directive are clarified, no such legislation will be forthcoming from Germany. My question is how much longer this is likely to take. These statements make one thing very clear, however: the infringement proceedings initiated back in May by you, Commissioner, are making very little impression on the German Justice Minister.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fail to understand how a Justice Minister can consider herself to be above the law. After all, she of all people must know that every EU Member State is obliged to transpose European legislation, and, what’s more, must do so by the specified deadline.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Justice Minister’s argument that the transposition of the existing Directive is impossible does not hold water. Perhaps you could make some kind of contribution to resolving this issue. At any rate, the example of Austria shows that a Member State that resisted for a very long time and refused to transpose the Directive can, in fact, create legislation that can serve as a very good model, with regulations that are sound and constitutional.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. − Mr President, as regards the position of the Justice Minister, the German Federal Constitutional Court has not said that the Data Retention Directive is unlawful. The Federal Constitutional Court merely pointed out that the provisions of the transposing law did not ensure adequate security of data storage and that safeguard provisions in relation to the state’s access to data were too weak. These, and nothing else, were the points on which the Court based its judgment. That being the case, Germany must act on the commitments undertaken at the European level and transpose the Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">As for Toulouse, it is always important to ensure that cases stand up in court, and for that, evidence is essential. If there is evidence of unlawful behaviour, then it is sensible to give due consideration to any evidence that may have been gathered though data retention as well.</p>

It was, and remains, necessary to guarantee that, within the bounds of proportionality and subject to appropriate safeguards and controls, these data are available for a limited period of time if police and prosecutors need to assess them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The limitation and procedures for data retention should be as harmonised as possible to minimise the negative impact on the internal market while, at the same time, respecting the legitimate and varying requirements of national circumstances. It was also necessary to have a solid European data protection level for this. All but two Member States have now transposed the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission’s evaluation of last year, evidence from Member States and Europol on the value of the measures of combating serious crime was presented. We have continued to press Member States to provide credible and comparable statistics and case studies to demonstrate this, and we have received quite a lot of information. Law enforcement and judicial authorities throughout the EU have repeatedly stressed the importance of knowing that data will be available if there is a need. However, as has been pointed out by different stakeholders – yourselves, different representatives of the data protection community, the industry, NGOs and different professional groups including journalists and lawyers – the Commission is also of the view that data retention has a significant impact on the right to privacy and the protection of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of areas in the current directive that ought to be improved. These areas are set out very clearly and in the evaluation report and they have been further examined during consultation. For instance, a reduced and more harmonised data retention period; a scope which is clear and exhaustive in terms of the type of data to be retained; and a clearer purpose limitation for which the data may be used. We also need minimum standards for access and use of the data, better accountability on the part of authorities for the data which they access and the statistics they provide, stronger data protection and a consistent approach to reimbursing the operator’s costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also – and this is very important – a need to be coherent between the obligation to require data retention in this directive – the Data Retention Directive – and the possibility that Member States have today to require, or to allow, data retention provided with the ePrivacy Directive. It is necessary to ensure that Member States cannot use retained data for other purposes than the ones in the Data Retention Directive. Currently Member States have this possibility in the ePrivacy Directive, so this is a loophole. The Commission has already announced that we will analyse the need to review the ePrivacy Directive once negotiations on the new general data protection framework are over.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are working towards a reform of the Data Retention Directive to be presented at the same time as the future revision of the ePrivacy Directive. Given the technical and legal complexity and the political sensitivity of this, it is likely to take some time, and I cannot give you a concrete timetable today. But I would like to mention that we very much appreciate your support and your input in this, which has contributed very constructively to our work and that of the data retention expert group.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, without ignoring the fact that data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the current Directive was born of the desire to harmonise national provisions on data retention, in order to ensure the availability of those data for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as terrorism or organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">This harmonisation is necessary because the inefficiency arising from the fragmentation created by national provisions has been demonstrated in studies and through practical experience. We therefore need to ensure the continued retention, at European level, of data that are generated or processed.</p>
      <p sl="es">A recent example of how these data can be used in a judicial context as a tool to fight crime is the arrest in Spain on 4 October 2012 of a young man planning to imitate the Columbine massacre by planting bombs at universities in the Balearic Islands. Following a police investigation using data obtained from electronic communications, it was ascertained that the young man had bought various explosive substances and items of equipment needed to make homemade bombs. As a result, it was possible to prevent a real tragedy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, I call on the Commission to present an urgent proposal for the revision of the legal framework for data retention, because the importance and sensitivity of this matter means that we cannot continue with a Directive that has technical shortcomings and intrudes, sometimes disproportionately, on the right to privacy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I am one of the authors of this question to the Commission and therefore share the concerns of my co-authors who spoke before me, because they are well founded.</p>
      <p sl="es">We find ourselves with a Directive that, at the time, was justified as serving to help fight organised crime, in particular terrorism, by means of data retention, with the attacks in Madrid and London in 2004 and 2005 respectively cited as examples.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, following legal proceedings, challenges before the Court of Justice, but also rulings by various constitutional courts, which raised doubts about compliance with the standards now enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and the principles of proportionality and necessity in all matters that may have a bearing on fundamental rights, which are enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is clear that we need to succeed in revising the Directive. It is also clear that we are justified in our concerns that this initiative, a precise timetable for which has yet to be announced, should comply with the principle of minimum intervention, that is, offer the least intrusive provisions from the point of view of fundamental rights and, therefore, the best guarantee of respect for the principles of necessity and proportionality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this Directive has been wrong from the very start. Let us go back in history and recall that the only reason that this House got to vote on the proposal for data retention was that the Member States could not agree. They had no unanimity, remember? There were many Member States which did not want this. That is why we got to vote on it, that was the only reason. Until today they have been trying to avoid parliamentary intervention.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, does it serve a purpose? Is it useful? Have we become safer since 2005 and 2006? Despite the fact that the evaluation only came through after a long delay, there is not a shred of evidence – not a shred – that it contributes to our safety. All the statements about the necessity of this directive are based on assumptions and nothing else. We have yet to see any figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Does it serve the purpose of harmonisation? Some colleagues have pointed out that it does not. It does not. It was not meant to from the start, because the Member States chose to compensate, or not, companies for the costs that they incurred.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was then deemed a violation of the constitution in many countries. Some colleagues may argue about this, but it is a technical point: only the implementation law was deemed unconstitutional. It seems almost impossible to find a way to implement it in a way that is reconcilable with the constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my own country, a report showed that there is widespread abuse and that data are being consulted much more often by many more people than is allowed. Does anybody take action? No.</p>
      <p sl="de">So here is a law that was pushed through, that does not serve a purpose, that seems to be a violation of the constitution and of which there is widespread abuse. So of course the Commission and the Member States say ‘great law, let’s have more of it’. I say to the Commissioner: we should not wait for a review. It should be repealed today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, let us remind ourselves of what is at stake here. We are discussing the collection of all of the telecommunications data, all of the telecommunications framework data, for all 500 million European citizens all of the time, not in specific situations, not if there is reason to suspect any wrongdoing, but all the time, on an ongoing basis. This amounts to the permanent surveillance of every individual!</p>
      <p sl="de">Please use your imagination and consider what a major intrusion this is into the basic rights of every citizen in Europe. This intrusion must be justified. Like the previous speakers, I would like to know what evidence is available to show that this Directive – all this data retention – is in fact necessary or a suitable means of achieving the objective, namely more effective investigation of crime, especially internet-based crime. I have not yet seen any evidence of that, or any indication that this is indeed the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us consider our real objective for a moment. Our real objective is to reduce crime rates and prevent crime. Let me say this: the Data Protection Directive has made no difference whatsoever. There is absolutely no difference in the crime statistics between the Member States where data retention takes place and those where it does not. This even applies to internet-related crime. Instead, we have invested vast sums of money in implementing data retention, which has proved to be extremely expensive. As a result, we have diverted funds from other areas where it could have been put to good use, such as providing police stations with internet access so that they can carry out case-specific investigations in the proper manner. That is something you should think about.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Voss, data retention does not solve any problems. In fact, it is the problem. Let me offer an analogy. Not long ago, I was walking through my home city of Dresden and happened to spot a burglar breaking into a house. Let me ask you this: would you now act on this information by passing a directive which states that women in my age group should stroll through Europe’s cities at night in order to reduce the crime rate? I think we should be asking about the benefits of the Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are nearing the end of this debate and I have just one point to make. Instead of flogging a dead horse – to use your analogy – and filching millions of people’s data, I would suggest that we proceed as follows. Ms Malmström, perhaps you could offer different advice to the Interior Ministers of the EU Member States. You could tell them not to make cuts in the police or law enforcement agencies in their countries. You could tell them to provide decent training for the police and the judiciary and to tackle corruption, which is now widespread. If we manage to achieve that in our countries, we would be making a valuable contribution to combating crime, which would greatly benefit citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor and according to judgments of the German, Czech and Romanian Constitutional courts, Directive 2006/24/EC, which directs telecommunications companies to retain identification data on callers, callees and places and times of telephone calls or emails for the purpose of possible investigation and prosecution of criminal offences for a period of six months to two years, does not comply with the requirements laid down by European law on privacy and data protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary, Commissioner, to take the appropriate decision either to repeal this Directive and leave it to Member States how to deal with this matter or, if there is agreement that common Union rules are needed with a view to police and judicial cooperation in such criminal matters, to prepare a new amendment, which should then, however, correspond to the culture of today’s European legislation.

The fact is that Member States have made use, in particular, of the period of retention of data, with the six-month to two-year period clearly being one of the tools most used by a large number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Several speakers have already mentioned the problems we are having due to the Directive having been transposed into national law in very different ways, and virtually all of the speakers have rightly underlined the problems that we are having as regards the protection of fundamental rights and the right to privacy. There is clearly an issue here that we must tackle. I must say that I am with those who enjoyed the Commissioner’s answers. I appreciate the Commissioner’s concerns about the scope of the Directive, the limitation of its subject matter and the reduction of retention periods. Everything that the Commissioner has said is covered, in my view, by the efforts to revise this Directive, which we must work on together.</p>

The Commissioner has already said that this will not happen by the end of this year, but she has also not given us any time horizon.

      <p sl="en">I do not know if I understood you correctly, but I think you said that you do not intend to table your proposal this year. So I ask you, will it be next year? Next year is long; it is twelve months long. Could you specify further when you plan to table your proposal?</p>
      <p sl="en">I am saying this because I would like to remind you that, right now, we are dealing with the personal data reform package. The European Parliament regards this dossier as a real priority and is working in a very engaged way on both the proposed regulation and the directive. I think we also need to harmonise the EU single market for telecommunications in this respect, and it is also time to deal with the ePrivacy Directive you yourself mentioned. So may I express the wish that the Commission take a more dynamic and determined stance vis-à-vis the Members States, even when so-called sensitive issues for the Member States are under discussion?</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude with the following remark, Commissioner. In the European Parliament you will always find an enthusiastic ally in your efforts to better protect the personal data of EU citizens. But while you can always rely on our full cooperation and support in this regard, at the same time let me emphasise that the European Parliament will also always be prepared to fight for and defend its principles and beliefs in favour of the protection of EU citizens’ rights, especially when fundamental rights are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Not even George Orwell himself could have dreamt up this Directive in his worst nightmares. Up to and including George Bush, no similar measures were proposed in the US in the year of terrorism paranoia, but a freeze was proposed instead.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, before I ask my question, I would just like to mention that, a week ago, the Polish Parliament passed a bill amending Polish telecommunications legislation. The Commission has been waiting a long time for this to happen. The new provisions will shorten the required data retention period from two years, which was a very long time, to 12 months, allowing Poland to join a group of European countries in which similar provisions are in force. We are currently also working on a data retention law, in particular on provisions governing the type of data retained and who will have access to it. It would therefore be good to know the Commission’s plans as regards changes to European legislation, so that we can begin to incorporate them into our work.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The changes in Poland are the result of the work of numerous non-governmental organisations that wrote on this subject and exerted pressure on the authorities, in the belief that the existing arrangements infringed citizens’ right to privacy. It is therefore worth listening carefully, including at European level, not only to Members of the European Parliament, but also to non-governmental organisations concerned with privacy issues. I would like to use this opportunity to ask the Commission whether it has any figures, reports, studies or information on the impact reducing the data retention period may have on the effectiveness of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crimes, because that is one of the main arguments in this issue. We are always talking about it, but can we produce any evidence, for example, with regard to prosecutions for crimes such as possession of child pornography? We are never short of statements or arguments, but we have no hard data.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, almost everything has been said that needs to be said, so I will keep it brief. Why data retention? After all, food stocks have to be replaced sooner or later. That means consuming or using the food and buying a new lot. At the beginning, the debate about data retention focused on its use in anti-terrorism. In practice, however, these data are available, so apparently they have to be used, and they are accessed to investigate a very wide range of crimes, including minor or moderately serious offences. Moreover, in the process, there is a growing data hunger that is driving the storage of types of data that were not originally envisaged. The volume of data is growing. At the very least, then, we must reduce the amount of data stored, the types of use, and the duration of storage. We must protect data from abusive forms of access and use. We should be open to discussing alternatives to the current practice, and we must be mindful of one principle above all: that the rule of law and the protection of civil rights are key pillars of governance in our countries and the EU. They must be respected and defended, if necessary by abolishing the Directive.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, when the Commissioner was speaking about the reform, she mentioned that it would be within the bounds of proportionality. No directive ever states that it is not within the bounds of proportionality; the same thing happened with passenger name records. However, in practice, without a directive that refers to exceptional cases, which are the only circumstances in which fundamental rights could be violated, we find ourselves in a situation that cannot be resolved. How can we settle on a definition of ‘serious crime’ if there are eight countries that do not talk about serious crime in the context of data retention but any type of crime?</p>
      <p sl="es">The volume of data and frequency of data retention involved make it completely impossible to manage these data properly for the purposes of tackling crime. Even when pursuing criminals and prosecuting crimes, it is not true that anything goes. The end does not justify the means. Only in exceptional cases can human rights be violated. We really need to reconsider this Directive. We cannot legislate in this manner.</p>

In Romania, the proposed legislation was first considered unconstitutional, and only this year was the transposition completed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is why I support a new act that addresses the more controversial aspects. The Commission must consider the constitutions of the Member States when devising these proposals, which must respect privacy rights. Even though the Commission announced last year its intention to modify the Directive, this was not yet done.

      <p sl="en">We did an evaluation in April 2011 which made use of evidence from the Member States – you may call it anecdotal – but we had evidence on how they used this. Since then we have received more evidence of how it is used. These are concrete examples of how data retention has been used in order to crack down on criminal and drug networks and to identify victims and persecutors in child abuse networks, etc. I would be happy to share them with the European Parliament. We have already done so and we are happy to do so again.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand the criticism here, and I share much of it, but we need to be honest: this is not the mass surveillance of 500 million citizens.

It is not mass surveillance; we need to be clear on this. These practices are subject to democratic and judicial controls in the Member States.</p>

We will seek to amend this and to shorten the data retention period. The revised proposal will also include a full assessment of the directive’s impact on privacy and other fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Data protection is a very important issue – all the Members would agree on this.

      <p sl="de">It is very welcome that the Commission has finally come to the realisation that the 2005 Directive must be amended. The criticisms made by the public, who have an interest in the protection of personal data, are clearly more convincing than the usual unrealistic claims heard in some circles that the Directive will improve security. The Data Retention Directive is an example of bad law. It does not respond to national needs, it is disproportionate, and it erodes citizens’ confidence in the rule of law. It is high time we remedied the situation. Ms Malmström should address the reform of this legislation as an immediate priority. She undoubtedly has the requisite sensitivity to do so, given that while serving as a Member of the European Parliament, she voted against the Directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak on our trade relations with Japan and the future EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note with interest the adoption of the motion for a resolution on EU trade negotiations with Japan by the Committee on International Trade two weeks ago. I hope that the European Parliament, in its vote expected later this week in the plenary, will clearly support the launching of EU-Japan FTA negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Japan is one of our main economic partners, and thus a decision to launch new FTA negotiations has to be based on solid ground. On 18 July of this year the Commission, after thoughtful consideration, decided to approve the draft recommendation to open negotiations with Japan and transmitted this to the Council. The ground for this decision has been prepared well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have an agreement with Japan on what both sides expect from the negotiations. The so-called ‘scoping paper’ lays out the scope of our potential discussions. It is the most ambitious paper of this kind that we have ever agreed with any trading partner. This gives us comfort that all our priorities will be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also negotiated – again upfront – a dedicated package that addresses key regulatory barriers, including for the car sector and railway procurement, which constitute the single most important hurdle for EU economic activities in Japan. Japan has also accepted that the phasing-out of tariffs can only take place strictly in parallel with the elimination of regulatory barriers. This means that the dismantling of EU tariffs will only take place once concrete results on the removal by Japan of regulatory barriers have been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">To ensure that Japan continues to make progress in eliminating regulatory barriers, I have suggested to the Council the introduction of a ‘rendezvous clause’ in the negotiating directives. The clause would allow the EU to take stock of the progress achieved within one year of the start of the negotiations and bring them to a halt in the event of our failing to achieve meaningful progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to note that many EU industry sectors have recently expressed their support for the launch of FTA negotiations with Japan. These include IT, consumer electronics, agri-foods and beverages, wholesale and retail distribution, chemicals, and services – all of them key for the expansion of EU economic interests abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us not forget that Japan remains a huge economy, with consumer spending power that is still roughly twice as large as China’s. It is therefore crucial to unlock the potential opportunities for EU companies to sell their products and services to a country that so far has remained fairly protected by non-tariff barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The FTA objective will be to eliminate these trade barriers and create a level playing field for our companies to enter and sell in that market. According to the impact assessment report of the future EU-Japan FTA, potential GDP growth close to 1 % is expected if we conclude this agreement. This is a significant gain, which cannot be ignored – especially at this time of economic difficulties. I hope we can count on your support in this endeavour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the development of cooperation between the European Union and third countries is of great importance for economic growth and employment, particularly at a time of crisis. However, the negotiating mandate should be economically balanced and politically strong. At the negotiating table, we should ask for clear results in respect of key demands, which is why the bar should remain high.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Non-tariff barriers are still the main obstacle in bilateral relations with Japan. For that reason, our demands should be clearly formulated and have been met within one year of the launch of the negotiations. It is important to ensure that the negotiations are suspended if a significant number of barriers are not eliminated within the first 12 months. The presence of safeguards for both economies, in particular for sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries, should be guaranteed. The chief condition for the conclusion of the agreement should be the genuine and complete removal of the aforementioned barriers, improved market access in public procurement for European Union businesses and a comprehensive chapter on investment that covers investment protection and market access.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that the agreement should be comprehensive, ambitious and fully binding. The free trade agreement should lead to genuine legal openness for European Union businesses. The conclusion of a free trade agreement between the European Union and Japan is a worthwhile endeavour, as the strengthening of cooperation and ties between the two parties have the potential to bring positive results.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly welcome Mr De Gucht who has, at this quite opportune moment, come to inform Parliament about the situation with the pre-negotiations, if we can call them that, between the Union and Japan. It is an opportune moment because this week Parliament will vote on, and in my opinion adopt, the report by Metin Kasak, who is rapporteur on the relations with Japan on this same issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the launch of negotiations and will therefore vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, which fundamentally coincides with the ideas set out for us today by Mr De Gucht. We believe that the potential of the economic and trade relations between the European Union and Japan is clearly underutilised and that the difficulty, in the case of Japan, is that the greatest potential for growth lies in removing the numerous non-tariff barriers to trade and investment that currently exist in that country. We therefore support an agreement with Japan, because that is the only way of effectively removing those barriers, or at least most of them, and allowing access to investment in that country, including in public procurement, which is an area in which these barriers are currently a real obstacle.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In my opinion, the scoping exercise which was conducted by the Commission and the Japanese Government resulted in satisfactory guarantees, with the conditions being met to begin negotiations with a good prospect of success. We need to be demanding on the objectives, and Parliament will therefore vote this week, through the motion for a resolution that I mentioned, on its recommendations with regard to the negotiating mandate that the Commission has requested from the Council. This will give the negotiator, that is the Commission, clear and more stringent guidance on what will make the agreement acceptable to Parliament, without whose assent no international trade treaty can be concluded. We now hope – and I am finishing. Mr President – that the Council will take due account of our recommendations and that the Commission will follow them to the letter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as the severe economic crisis frustrates the EU’s common vision, the vote on the Japan trade resolution can take us a step forward towards free trade negotiations with one of the biggest trading blocs in the world and benefit European citizens by maximising the jobs and growth potential under the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot accept that our two-way trade with the world’s third-largest national economy amounts to only a quarter of our trade with the US or China. The potential gains are clear. The Commission has estimated that nearly two thirds of such gains under the EU’s trade policy would come from potential agreements with the US and Japan. However, we realise that the negotiations will not be easy and that the Commission must be firm with its Japanese partners. That is why, as rapporteur, I have tabled amendments for a binding review clause within one year of the launch of negotiations to allow for a thorough assessment of the implementation of the 31 roadmaps agreed under the scoping exercise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our chief incentive during negotiations has to be the implementation of the commitments made by Japan to eliminate non-tariff barriers in various sectors, particularly the automotive sector. To ensure this I included a provision that if Japan has not delivered on its NTB commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the EU’s priority demands, the Commission should stop negotiations, after consultations with the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, as rapporteur and representative of the ALDE Group, I urge the Member States to cast their cautiousness aside. Now is not the time to say ‘let’s wait a few more months’ or ‘we need more concessions’: now is the time to launch negotiations with Japan. Dear colleagues, the ground has been prepared. Let us translate our ambition into action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we welcome the effort to start negotiations with Japan on improving our economic partnership. But to me the Kazak report seems to be an almost indecisive report. It gives me the impression of someone who wants to put his foot on the gas pedal and the brake at the same time. We should make up our mind as to whether we want to go forward or sit back for fear of getting into trouble with some industrial players and some industrial sectors that play the protectionist card.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should strive, not only for mercantilist reasons but also for geostrategic reasons, to make this effort with the Japanese a success. That success should reach beyond merely trade-oriented aspects; it should, if possible, include issues like sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not believe that every single regulatory measure that does not please everybody is, for that reason, a trade or a regulatory barrier. If we were to go by the yardstick of some industrial lobbyists, a night flight ban for Tokyo airport would be considered a regulatory barrier. The Commission was smarter than that and did not include that in its list, but it shows to what extremes some people want to carry the case. We regret that the key car category was considered to be a barrier rather than an opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last point: we should go ahead with this Treaty and do so with more transparency than we have done similar things in the past, and clearly with more transparency that the TPP has been pursued with so far.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Conservatives and Reformist Group have always been one of the most pro-trade groups in this Parliament, if not the most pro-trade, and we have wanted as many trade agreements as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the absence of the WTO or any progress in the WTO and of my second choice, which would be comprehensive plurilateral agreements, we have to fall upon bilateral agreements, given that it is vital that we negotiate bilateral agreements with the largest economies of the world. Japan clearly falls into that category.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things that we should remember in trade – and I say this as a former lecturer in international trade, to apologise for my former academic background – is that there is a myth in trade. Countries do not trade with each other; it is people and businesses that trade with people and businesses in other countries for mutual benefit. All that governments can do is either facilitate by getting out of the way or get in the way with tariff barriers or non-tariff barriers – and all too often we see governments get in the way with these barriers. So surely it is time during this agreement – during the negotiations on this agreement – to reduce as many barriers as possible. However, unfortunately – as other speakers have said – politicians can sometimes be persuaded by entrenched interests, and we are all politicians and are all susceptible to those entrenched interests. We have seen this happen over the course of the last 18 months in discussions about these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some industry players have talked about certain barriers, but as one of the previous speakers said, one person’s health and safety standard is another person’s non-tariff barrier. So I think we have to be sensitive to what is a non-tariff barrier and what is not. We have to recognise that the EU-Japan agreement will be complex and that both sides will want to feel that their consumers and their domestic industries are gaining. So my colleagues here clearly wanted no agreement – or no start to that agreement – until we had overcome the whole list of non-tariff barriers. Now that is unrealistic to expect of any trading partner, and I am glad that the Commissioner has been a supporter – as have many of the other groups –of going forward with this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential that we negotiate all these barriers and perceived barriers, but actually we know that, at the end of the day, we have the ability to stop this deal if we do not feel that enough has been done. Therefore I am pleased, and I hope that we will continue the momentum to launch these negotiations. If it helps – and I think it does help soothe some of those industry concerns – I support the binding review clause which allows the negotiating parties to step back after a year and to look at the agreement and consider whether the other side has done enough. We, the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty, have the ability to say that actually, enough has to been done. But at a time when the EU continues to be crippled by an anaemic if not negative growth rate, when we are burdened with debt mountains and when Japan itself has had two lost decades of growth, surely what we should be looking for is an enhanced trading relationship with Japan which is underpinned by a free trade agreement in order to generate a 1 % boost in the Union’s overall GDP and up to 400 000 jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Japan has other interests and other options it can pursue, and we have to be careful that we are not played off against other parties negotiating trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated between the United States, Japan and a number of other countries. But overall, I think that the EU has a unique opportunity to lay a foundation stone that could bring untold benefits to all of Europe. It is my sincere hope that the European Parliament will show that it can be a responsible and trustworthy partner in an institutional legislative process and will give its seal of approval for the start of immediate negotiations with Japan.</p>

You said in your speech – correctly, in my view – that countries do not trade with each other; it is people and businesses that trade with each other.

      <p sl="en">It is quite clear, as I have said, that people and businesses trade with people and businesses in another country for mutual benefit, but actually trade agreements can facilitate that and lack of trade agreements can get in the way.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an intelligent agreement between the EU and Japan would lead to stronger integration of the two economies. It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles?</p>
      <p sl="de">The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in principle we strongly favour a trade treaty with Japan, but it has to be fair to both sides. At the moment Japan retains numerous non-tariff barriers. It is very hard for a foreign company to acquire a company in Japan, and there can be undue political influence. The effect is that, while Japan is always keen to export its own goods, it remains a complicated country in which to do business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, the gross domestic product of Japan is larger than that of France, Belgium and Italy combined. A meaningful trade agreement would be good for everybody. However, as my colleague Mr Schulz has mentioned, there are signs that the French and German automobile manufacturers and their lobbyists are seeking to frustrate, or otherwise limit, an EU-Japan trade agreement. That would be wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brings me to an important related point. Because there are so many different trade interests in the 27 Member States, all of which have to be satisfied in some measure, it actually makes it significantly more difficult for the EU as an entity to conclude trade agreements than it would be for a single nation state on its own. Not easier, as is wrongly - and often - asserted. That is why, for example, Switzerland, with a gross domestic product less than one sixth of that of the UK alone, has had its trade agreement in place with Japan since December 2009, while this evening we are just talking about one.</p>

To address the very important and interesting point that he made in the next 20 seconds: yes, many EU countries are protectionist. We are concerned in our country that it is not the level playing field that it ought to be, and that is one of the strongest arguments why we in our political party believe that Britain should leave the EU, and that the EU in its present form is unreformed and unreformable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of us in this House are firmly convinced that we need to launch this strategic partnership with Japan as a matter of urgency and that it needs to be intensified. There are economic reasons for this, and it is only fair and logical that after concluding a free trade agreement with Korea, we should do the same with other countries in the region in order to avoid the distortions of trade which would result from an agreement with Korea alone. I hope that we can achieve a genuine free trade agreement. Let me be frank, however: I have serious concerns as a result of the way the preparations have proceeded over recent months. For example, I clearly remember how pleased we were, at the end of last year, when Japan made concessions on railways, but we are still facing major difficulties in implementing these commitments. That is my concern: are the Japanese genuinely willing and able to open their markets? Or are they more interested in improving access to our markets for Japanese car companies while doing nothing in return at home?</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, I would ask for the first year until the review to be used to test whether there is genuine interest on both sides in reciprocal market liberalisation and in the benefits that this partnership affords.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I have major concerns about the issue of resources. Commissioner, at present, more than 30 international negotiations are under way in the field of external trade, and resources are integral to that. We see this with the agreements where negotiations are, in effect, at an end, such as the agreements with Central America or with Colombia and Peru. Since the conclusion of the negotiations, it has taken 18 months to two years to reach the consent procedure here in the European Parliament, because the translations take forever and because the Legal Services take forever to complete their review. I would thus be most grateful, Commissioner, if your Directorate-General could propose ways of speeding up this process ahead of the forthcoming budget negotiations but also in view of the restructuring of the Commission framework.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution before Parliament is an important policy document taking account of the ambitions and concerns that European manufacturers have for some time held with regard to a country that is both a great opportunity for our economy and a great problem.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU and Japan together represent more than a third of world GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. These figures alone give us an idea of the importance of the upcoming negotiations. I would have preferred Japan to send out stronger signals than it has done, in my opinion. The most important question remains the removal of the numerous non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by the Japanese as well as regulatory barriers that cannot merely be ascribed to cultural differences. Such removal should be seen as a precondition for reaching a mutually balanced and mutually advantageous agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">The outcomes on public procurement and the automotive sector seem particularly decisive for a successful conclusion to negotiations. Japan should open up its market to the same extent as the EU in a spirit of real reciprocity, in particular with regard to NTBs in the automotive sector such as the ‘zoning regulations’ and special fiscal treatment for ‘key cars’. The question of indications of origin for agro-food products including wines and spirits is also important.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament should also ensure that it is continuously informed on the progress of negotiations and that the Commission carry out a second assessment of the impact of a possible free trade agreement with Japan, in particular with regard to more sensitive sectors such as the automotive and electronics industries. This is the only manner in which to provide proper protection to European manufacturing sectors at a time of crisis without compromising our commitment to free, sustainable and fair trade.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tone of this debate has changed since June, when we were among the few voices calling for a swift launch to negotiations for a free trade agreement. Japan has always been a very complex case, more difficult to deal with, understand and decipher than many other countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">We now find ourselves under strong pressure from the Member States and many sectors to move as slowly as possible in the direction of a free trade agreement, as if Japan were enemy number one of European industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">I urge the Commission to proceed with a dual approach. On the one hand, it must be firm, since we have included several conditions in our resolution that are entirely advantageous, with great emphasis on non-tariff barriers. However, an effort must also be made to ensure that it is used as far as possible to provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, to create the possibility of cultural cooperation with Japan – since as a country it is an ideal candidate with great potential in this area – and to undertake joint scientific research with one of the leading innovators.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second approach should be to make the agreement a success, since it is much more important than so many other agreements in geopolitical terms. It can serve to stabilise relations with South Korea and our economic and trade relations with China. Let us recall that we are dealing with a great democracy, and that this is one of the chief aspects of the agreement.</p>

ACTA was intensely disliked by citizens, and there are now additional concerns about the negotiations the Commission is having with Canada in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement. Why would we also want these complications with Japan? In addition, Japan causes us no concerns in terms of intellectual property rights. This negotiation exercise comes at a time when, at multilateral level in the World Intellectual Property Organisation, we are for the first time ever advancing the rights of citizens instead of the rights of rights holders in the deliberations on the treaty for the blind.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in May 2011 two of the largest trade areas in the world began negotiations with a view to laying the foundations of a free trade agreement, an ambitious agreement that would significantly deepen existing relations between both powers, strengthening their ties, and would cover issues of great importance, such as the removal of tariffs and tariff barriers.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result of this agreement, both economies will be more effective and more competitive in a much wider market. The abolition of tariffs and consequent elimination of customs barriers will undoubtedly boost our trade relations.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the European Union must stand firm and not forget the commitments it has obtained from Japan, such as the promise to remove non-tariff barriers, in particular those affecting sectors such as the automotive industry or the obstacles to market access in public procurement, commitments that must translate into results, which is the prerequisite if the negotiations under way are to achieve their intended goal.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is what the members of the Committee on International Trade stated in their motion for a resolution, which will be put to the vote on Thursday. If these conditions are met, in the case of these two mature economies, Europe and Japan, the future agreement will undoubtedly prove a success for both parties.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, in a globalised world, Japan and the European Union are strategic partners with mutual interests. These agreements should be based on mutual trust and mutual responsibility. It takes time to consider an option, but the rate of market penetration in Japan is one of the lowest of all of the industrialised countries: 3 % compared to 30 % in the European Union. Japan must undertake to lower its non-tariff barriers and to remove administrative obstacles to market access in public procurement – such as in respect of leather and footwear – as just one day a year is devoted to public procurement and the quota has not changed since 1996.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are problems with plant health products, textiles and with the automotive sector. In this agreement, the automotive sector is the main question to be considered, in particular the utility vehicle sector. In Spain, it accounts for 10 % of GDP and 9 % of employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Japan therefore needs to work on reducing its tariff barriers, but also on transparency and allowing the European market increased opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on the successful conclusion of the discussions on the envisaged FTA with Japan and the adoption of the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mutual commitment to democracy, the rule of law and a free market economy creates a fertile soil for upgrading trade relations. A deep and comprehensive Free Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement would surely contribute to the emergence of new synergy between the partners. Both sides would benefit from such a partnership, which would give an impetus to their respective economies – in particular industry and innovation – at the turbulent time in the world economy in which we find ourselves. Further integration of the European and Japanese economies is also needed to compete with aggressively-growing BRIC nations. There is no time to lose, and I would hope that the Council decision will ensure that you will very soon be able to start negotiations with the Japanese counterparts.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I congratulate both rapporteurs on their excellent resolution, which reflects an awareness of the need to develop a strategic partnership with Japan. Currently this is the most important trade negotiation that the European Union has been involved in to date.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I share the conviction that a free trade agreement will contribute to strengthening the economic growth of both partners, as well as to improving the balance of trade between the European Union and Japan. Trade liberalisation remains the most appropriate method of stimulating the economy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The possible short-term turbulence brought about by liberalisation should be viewed from the angle of the long-term positive effects of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I support the clarity and decisiveness of the resolution regarding the elimination of non-tariff barriers, including in the area of public procurement, and regarding proposals for the sequence of essential actions, monitoring and the timetable. These proposals will only enhance the credibility of the entire project.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I anticipate that this report will help generate the proper atmosphere to give the Council a green light to start negotiations soon. I view the free trade agreement as an important step towards a more comprehensive economic and political partnership between the European Union and Japan.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to add my support for the Commission proposal for a free-trade agreement with Japan, known as an important trade and political partner of the Union and one of the world’s biggest economies. In addition, the Commission’s relevant studies show that such an agreement would increase bilateral trade, with gains of EUR 43 billion for the Union, and EUR 53 billion for Japan.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must, however, ensure that the agreement addresses non-tariff barriers and I appreciate the commitment of our Japanese partners in resolving this matter through internal measures and reforms.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To cite a recent article in the Wall Street Journal by former Prime Minister Hatoyama, the current leader of the Japanese delegation to the European Parliament, the European Union and Japan can form a de facto single market. We share the Japanese opinion in this sense and a common vision on the global markets. The free trade agreement would further strengthen our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The real benefits of this agreement – exports, job creation, increased growth and competitiveness of the European Union – would most certainly outweigh the preventable challenges, which we should tackle sooner rather than later.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by underlining my support for free trade agreements as a fundamental means of stimulating the much-longed-for and much-needed economic growth and the creation of jobs. These agreements also boost relations with our allies, in this instance Japan.</p>
      <p sl="es">The former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama recently stated in an article in the Wall Street Journal that both Brussels and Tokyo had strong ties with Washington, but that the ties between Brussels and Tokyo were not so strong. I agree with him that this agreement could be an opportunity to redress this imbalance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, at a time when we are considering launching negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan, I believe that the European Union’s trade strategy should be in keeping with its industrial strategy and I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion on this point.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, if we want industry’s share of GDP to rise from the current 16 % to 20 %, as proposed in the Europe 2020 agenda, it would make sense, in my opinion, to listen to the concerns of industry itself when it comes to trade policy. The automotive industry is undoubtedly of key importance in this respect. We should therefore listen to its concerns and work with it to ensure that this agreement becomes a reality as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Free trade between the European Union and Japan has a lot of potential, which has yet to be exploited and may be developed by this agreement. Nevertheless, protective measures for key European Union and Member States industries – such as the automobile industry – must be instituted. The car manufacturing sector is important to Romanian companies, such as Dacia, which sees an increased market share in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Other areas may benefit from a free trade agreement, which would be advantageous for both European suppliers and consumers, the latter being given more choice.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I am aware that Japan, despite its technological and economic maturity, is not very welcoming when it comes to opening up its own trading area. It is nevertheless essential on our part to continue to make efforts to expand bilateral trade agreements, especially with economically advanced countries, where trade is of advantage to both contracting parties.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am convinced that a balanced free trade agreement can bring economic profit both for our producers and for the Japanese side. I therefore welcome the agreement reached on the content of the open negotiations and it is to be hoped that the Japanese side will also be interested in achieving progress in resolving sensitive questions such as regulatory obstacles in the automobile industry or rail transport. Our position should be clear. The European Union, like Japan, needs new and effective initiatives to support its economy and well organised, open trade relations are the best way forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have a long tradition of trade with Japan, and this free trade agreement is welcome. But the EU also has a proud tradition of human rights and environmental protection in its international agreements. This free trade agreement is an opportunity to demonstrate our joint commitments and concern for our planet’s wellbeing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Japan must be aware of our concerns about their continued whaling operations and, despite their own forest protection, they remain the largest importer of illegal timber from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. So, before we can conclude any trade deals, they need to know that we will expect them to clean up their act. We call on Japan to stop the whaling and the Asian forest destruction.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not entirely share the optimism of the majority of my colleagues. Indeed, I fear that we are going too fast. Japan is without doubt a major trading partner for the European Union, but is it a partner that we can fully trust today?</p>
      <p sl="fr">For decades, the Japanese closed their market to us via ever more numerous and original non-tariff barriers. With a view to concluding a free trade agreement with the European Union, Japan promised to remove many of these, but its words were not always followed by actions. Before opening difficult negotiations on a free trade agreement, I would have liked us to be certain that a large number of non-tariff barriers had indeed been removed, so that we could be sure of the willingness and capacity of our partner to play ball.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are going too fast and we are once again going to begin negotiations that will not come to anything, as was the case with India and Mercosur. I do not understand why we are persisting with Japan, when some of its neighbours have shown themselves to be altogether more open to the European Union, such as Taiwan, which is also an important partner for the Asian region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in repeated debates in plenary and in committee, I have made it clear that I am a staunch supporter of a free trade agreement with Japan, but also that such support is conditional. We have the scoping exercise and we also have agreement on a number of non-tariff barriers that have to be removed. These cannot be dissociated. It is very clear to me that Japan has to deliver on those NTBs, and within a very clear timetable.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have agreed on the roadmap, setting out how to do this. I must say that I am not very pleased at the moment, in fact, because there were a couple of obligations Japan should have fulfilled by the end of September, and we are now at the end of October. We should stick to our timetable. I will say this very clearly to our Japanese counterparts; I did so as recently as a week ago, and I will say it again. I will also say it to the Council, at the Council meeting of Ministers responsible for trade that will take place on 29 November.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a clear understanding with the Japanese on the scoping exercise and on what needs to be fulfilled and resolved, including for example the zoning problem that has been mentioned by a couple of Members. We should take them at their word, and their words should be followed by deeds.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the review clause that a number of Members of Parliament mentioned in their speeches – especially the rapporteur, Mr Kazak – is an essential element. I do not want it to be automatic, however; I do not believe that automaticity is a good negotiating tool. If it should be demonstrated that Japan is not fulfilling its commitments, you should summon me before your Parliament and ask me why I am not putting an end to the negotiations. I do not believe, however, that it is realistic to expect automaticity to work in negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On sustainability, Mr Bütikofer, that issue will be part of the negotiations and it will be part of the agreements, as by the way it is in the whole new generation of agreements that we have been negotiating. I also believe that, in the case of Japan, there are a number of very important topics in that area that we should address.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Caspary mentioned – although I see that in the meantime he has disappeared – that the only aim of the Japanese is to export more cars to Europe. I do not know about that. It is very interesting to look at their export figures to Europe, because they are gradually going down, not up. They have gone from EUR 900 000 down to about EUR 600 000 over a couple of years. It is also not true that Japan is just exporting smaller cars to Europe. Japan is in fact exporting cars in the mid- and upper range, so we should take care that when we discuss these matters we do so on the basis of the facts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one last remark to make on industrial policy, which Mr Zalba Bidegain mentioned. If I understand his reasoning, it is as follows. If we want industrial production to increase from 16 % to 20 %, then we should take care with the Japanese. I believe this is a very defensive strategy or tactic – whatever you want to call it – for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the industrial production share of GDP is not going to go up from 16 % to 20 %. That simply will not happen. To people who make this claim, my answer is to ask what is going down in that case, to make up the full 100 %. What is going down? Services? I cannot see that. Could it be agriculture? I do not think we would like that. Of course, in your country at the moment the industrial sector’s percentage share of GDP is going up, because you have seen a tremendous dip in real estate, which appears in the statistics as services, whilst the industrial sector as such has not changed. What can go up is the output of the industrial sector, and that is in fact happening. If you look locally at Europe, you can see that is what is happening, but not, I believe, in terms of industrial production as a share of GDP. Secondly, I believe the kind of economy that we have can only grow if it is in interaction with the other big players on the world market. We have become very interdependent, and that goes for the United States, Japan, China and also Europe. We have to take that interdependence into account and make sure that our position in that global arena is as strong as possible.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The European car industry is good for 12 million jobs, has been hit hard by the financial-economic crisis and by ever increasing competition from third countries. Today we are facing the prospect of possible negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and Japan. We must be very careful here not to put the car industry under even more pressure. Just look at Ford Genk in Belgium, where there is currently great social unrest due to the possible restructuring/closure of the factory. We must ensure that the guarantee that we build in today, namely the eradication by Japan of the non-tariff barriers that impact upon the car industry, will be complied with in the future. This is the only way that our companies can compete fairly with Japanese companies. We should come to a judgment about the abolition of the non-tariff barriers within the year and on that basis take a decision on a future free trade agreement with Japan.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Japan is the European Union’s third most important trading partner. Concluding the free trade agreement would bring innumerable advantages for both parties. Europe would be able to increase its exports and thereby generate new jobs. Hungary has a particular interest in the launch of free trade negotiations as this could greatly facilitate Hungarian agricultural exports to this country in the Far East. As a result of the agreement, the Japanese automotive industry could make further investments in Europe and in Hungary, which would create new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I remember, some time ago now, being one of a handful of Members to criticise several entire sections of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The text willingly ran roughshod over individual freedoms and rules on the processing of personal data, among other things. When they heard our arguments, many laughed in our faces, and Commissioner De Gucht told us that we had nothing to worry about. There were just a handful of us but, through hard work, we managed to persuade a majority to reject this freedom-destroying text. Next came the negotiation of a trade agreement between Europe and Canada: the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Imagine my surprise when I found that the agreement contained entire paragraphs from ACTA. Commissioner De Gucht told me not to worry about it. It should be noted that the text has been amended since, but it still contains some delicate passages. You will thus understand why I am concerned that the new agreement between Europe and Japan that we are talking about today may contain another Trojan horse, with fresh attempts at policy laundering thrown in. European citizens would be grateful if you could allay their fears.</p>
