      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to participate in the debate today on the European Court of Auditors’ annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, which I have already presented to you and to the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to present to the House the four key messages contained in this year’s annual report. First, the Court concludes that the accounts of the European Union give a fair presentation, and a true and fair view, of the financial position and the result of operations and cash flows. This is the third consecutive year the Court has found the accounts to be free from material misstatements and reliable.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards legality and regularity, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on revenue and commitments, as in previous years. However, and this is the second key message of this year’s annual report, payments from the budget continue to be materially affected by error, except in two areas. Those exceptions are administrative expenditure and economic and financial affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all other areas of expenditure, the Court found material levels of error. I will focus on the two main areas of expenditure: agriculture and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of agriculture and natural resources, the Court estimates the level of errors to be somewhat higher than in 2008. However, the results are consistent with the Court’s assessment, in both years, that systems are only partially effective. The Court recommends reducing the risk of error by improving the quality of information in the databases used for establishing entitlements and calculating payments, and by clarifying and enforcing rules on land usage and maintenance.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of cohesion, which represents almost a third of the budget, the situation remains that this is the only budgetary area where the estimated error is over 5%. Most of the errors found relate to serious failures by national authorities to apply rules on public procurement and to the reimbursement of ineligible costs. Many errors could, and should, have been detected and corrected by Member States before certifying expenditure to the Commission, as the audit shows they had the information to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we analyse this year’s results and compare them to last year, we see that the most significant change is in cohesion. That brings me to the Court’s third key message. The estimate for the most likely error in cohesion spending was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the Court’s estimate of errors has fallen over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a degree of caution is necessary before drawing any conclusions about the trend in this area; due to variations in spending patterns, the population of payments can change considerably from one year to the other – 2009 being notably different from 2008. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the overall fall in the estimated error rate over recent years will continue, so long as the systems covering the vast majority of disbursements remain only partially effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the last key message. The information provided by the Commission on recoveries and other corrections is not yet completely reliable and cannot be meaningfully compared with the Court’s estimated error rate.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of initiatives before us which provide an important opportunity to improve the financial management of the European Union. This year’s annual report confirms the conclusions and the recommendations set out in the Court opinion on the risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the European Union. Improving the quality of spending should be a high priority. Simplifying the legislative framework and introducing more cost-effective control systems to reduce the risk of errors should contribute to this goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier this year, the Commission presented a draft recast Financial Regulation. In its recent opinion on this, the Court concludes that it contains a number of proposals that provide opportunities for the Commission to improve transparency and financial management. Simplification of sectoral legislation remains, however, an important route to a significant improvement in the quality of spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next year, the Commission will present legislative proposals for policies and programmes covering the main areas of expenditure in the next programming produced. When revising expenditure programmes, the Court suggests applying a set of principles to ensure that European added value is likely, that the objectives are clear, that the schemes are as realistic and simple as is reasonably possible, and that accountability is also clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring the European funds are spent optimally places heavy responsibilities on all of us: on the Commission, when proposing legislation and implementing the budget; on the Member States in managing, day-to-day, some 80% of the European budget; on Parliament and on the Council as legislator and as the discharge authority; and on the Court as the Union’s external auditor.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court looks forward to playing its full part in efforts to ensure that the funds are spent correctly and are spent well.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, two days ago, President Caldeira and I already had the opportunity to exchange our views and to discuss the Court’s annual report with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would like here to outline the main points of the discussion and the very first conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before entering the heart of the matter, I would like to recall the fruitful dialogue between the auditor, the Court and the audit team in the Commission and to thank President Caldeira for this excellent cooperation. I am pleased with the Court’s recognition of progress made; I see indeed many positive messages; I also see some criticism and it is the Commission’s commitment to closely follow up on all the Court’s recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main messages of the Court’s report are key for the Commission’s own assessment of the way it assumes its responsibility in managing the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, for the third year in a row, the annual accounts have received an unqualified positive opinion. The Court has evaluated the EU accounts as giving a true and fair view without any reservation. The Commission is, of course, very satisfied with this result as it confirms the lasting effects of our accounting reform. However, the Court rightly highlights certain weaknesses. While none of these affects the Court’s unqualified opinion, the Commission is determined to address these weaknesses and therefore continues to improve its day-to-day accounting practices. With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, I am pleased that the positive trend in the reduction of the overall error rate continued in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Revenue and commitments for the entire budget are legal and regular in all material respects. More than 95% of payments made from the EU budget are free from error. This verdict is a positive sign that our efforts to further improve control are having a concrete impact. This has been achieved mainly thanks to a substantial reduction of the error rate in cohesion; this progress reflects the Commission’s enhanced supervisory role through the ex-ante assessment of management and control systems of the Member States. It also reflects the merits of a rigorous approach in either interrupting or suspending payments where problems were identified.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in its report, the Court recognises the higher quality of the information about recoveries provided by the Commission, as disclosed in the accounts. The increase in the value of funds recovered from projects where errors were found or from national authorities responsible is indeed another sign of this Commission’s determination. However, I share the Court’s view that the Member States’ reporting is not yet satisfactory and the Commission will pursue its efforts to remedy this situation for the existing programmes, and also for the next generation of programmes and the shared management.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share the caution of President Caldeira when he warns of possible oscillations of the error rate, in particular in cohesion, in the future. I also agree with the Court when it points out the weaknesses of the Member States’ systems and some other issues in shared management. In my view, the way forward includes the design of cost-effective control mechanisms; the simplification of eligibility rules where their complexity is an obvious source of errors; and the improvement of the quality of the information provided by the Member States regarding financial corrections and recoveries.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this list is not exhaustive. Our discussion on Tuesday showed that there are other challenges before us, for instance, a greater accountability for the key financial actors, in particular, the Member States, and a cost-effective control policy based on risk and performance. Moreover, in preparing the budget review, I have promoted the new focus on impact rather than input through the definition of clear and measurable objectives and key performance indicators. I presented last May my agenda on discharge, audit and anti-fraud for 2010-2014 in the Budgetary Control Committee of this House. This agenda outlined the key strategic objectives and concrete steps which the Commission will take to move further towards a positive Court statement of assurance. In the light of the Court’s 2009 annual report, this agenda remains fully relevant for our future actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I am pleased that the 2009 annual report corroborates that our efforts bear results. It constitutes an important and timely input to our reflection on how to achieve a more effective and efficient financial management of the EU budget which should guide us in preparing the next generation of programmes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very good day ahead of us, because for the first time, we can expect the Barroso II Commission to cross the 2% barrier. We do not really need the tolerable risk of error. This is why the Court of Auditors’ report that has been submitted to us definitely represents very good news, in particular, for all of those who are working in this area. It is clear that when the Commission makes a genuine and determined effort, it can come up with the results.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at these results in more detail, it is obvious that they are in part due to the changes in the regulations. This is definitely the case and this is the route which we must take in future. If the Commission could bring itself to revise the directive concerning public procurement and genuinely make things simpler for public bodies in the Member States, this would certainly be the biggest step that we could take towards a positive statement of assurance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say to everyone who constantly maintains that the European budget is exposed to major risks, it is true that European spending should certainly be subject to more consistent controls than national spending. European money is monitored more consistently and has to be accounted for more consistently than many areas of national budgets, as always becomes clear when we visit the Member States, because the national regulations have only been put in place as a result of the European regulations. Therefore, we simply need to encourage the Member States and call on them to subject their national spending to the same controls as European spending and vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the Court of Auditors, but I would also like to say that I am disappointed by this annual report. I have already mentioned that the annual report contains significantly less information than it did in the past. We need details of the error rates. We have always been given this information for the structural funds, but this year, for the first time, we have not received it. We are not at nursery school here. We in Parliament rely on having this information. When I look back at the hearing involving the members of the Court of Auditors, I recall that they promised to work closely together with Parliament. I do not believe that this promise is being kept.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome the annual report and congratulate President Caldeira and all the Members of the Court for their excellent work. Allow me especially to thank Mr O’Shea for the excellent cooperation we had concerning the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our role as a parliament is accountability towards the citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers’ money is used properly, transparently and effectively. I expect that the findings of the annual reports concerning the agencies, to be published later, will follow the same trend as in recent years. The situation is getting better, but there are still control systems to be improved, problems to be tackled and solutions to be found.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current major economic and social crisis, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before, and we in Parliament and the Court of Auditors are together committed to dealing with, and solving, the problems in order to achieve even better results.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area?</p>
      <p sl="de">My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read this annual report, I experienced a feeling of déjà lu, a feeling that I was once again reading something that I had been reading for many years. First of all, in particular, too many material errors are occurring in the areas of agriculture, the Cohesion Fund, research and development, external aid, development cooperation and education. Secondly, the supervisory and control systems have been only partially effective in preventing and correcting reimbursement of claims for excessive or ineligible costs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, we are still faced with the fundamental problem that Member States are not doing what they ought to be doing, which is properly monitoring the money they pay out to beneficiaries. We are talking here about 80% of the European budget. Another fundamental problem that remains is that the Commission is not making sufficient efforts to monitor the activities of the Member States in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore endorse the rapporteur’s strategy, which will entail, on the one hand, ensuring that we demand, above all, national management declarations signed by ministers of finance and, on the other, ensuring that the Commission finally takes action against any Member States that remain in breach and, if need be, imposes tough sanctions: of a financial kind, for instance – withholding subsidies. That is, in my view, the path we need to follow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Court of Auditors is a kind of great superintendent, we might say a policeman, a friendly policeman, although sometimes I have the impression that it turns a blind eye and is too good and too benevolent towards the institutions which it supervises. The conclusion of this report, the conclusion of the Court’s work is as follows: ‘good, but not perfect’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have the impression that many people in Europe are more pessimistic than the Court of Auditors. The Court must have a greater role, the Court must be credible, so that the European institutions will be credible in the eyes of the taxpayers and voters. However, for the Court to be credible, it must really be very scrupulous, because the Court is saying, today, that it is glad the glass is 95% full, while I think many taxpayers will ask: ‘but why is it 5% empty?’ All the more so, because there is a widespread belief that it is more than just 5% empty. I do agree with one conclusion – supervision at European level is sometimes more detailed, perhaps, than in Member States, and I call on the Court to exercise greater supervision in the Member States, where the money is quite simply frequently disappearing down the drain.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for an excellent report. As we have heard, overall, there has been a reduction in the number of errors being made. What should we make of this? In my opinion, this depends on two things: the starting point and our expectations. The starting point was horrendously poor. In 2008, billions of euro were paid out in contravention of the rules. Therefore, the expectations were that there should not only be improvements, but that there should be significant improvements in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="da">So, has this happened? Yes, in the area of cohesion, there has been a definite reduction in erroneous payments, which is a good thing, even if their level is still unacceptably high. In other areas, however, there has actually been a rise, which is quite simply not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="da">The other day in the Committee on Budgetary Control and again today, Commissioner Šemeta claimed that the overall reduction in the number of errors was a result of the Commission’s efforts. That is fine by me. I am happy to give the Commission the credit. In that case, however, it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year. Please take that as an invitation.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="96954" name="Marta Andreasen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, year after year over the last 16 years, the auditors have been refusing to clear 90% or more of the budget, and this year is no exception. They talk about errors, but the nature of the irregularities they find goes far beyond that of a mistake. Suffice to say that such a situation would cause the closure of a company in the private sector and the conviction of its directors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that taxpayers’ money has been unlawfully spent. This year, the auditors claim that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out. What is the essence of the problem? The lack of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission and the auditors will, as usual, blame the Member States, but the fact is that the failure resides within the Commission due to the lack of proper controls. The Commission is in the best position to establish the rules and to sanction those who breach them, but it has failed all along and this Parliament also bears responsibility, as it has approved the situation every year and keeps asking for an increase in the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no hope any more that the EU budget will ever be cleared by the auditors. At this point, the only way to protect taxpayers’ money is to reduce the EU budget drastically.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I address the British Prime Minister. Mr Cameron, in accepting a 2.9% increase for the 2011 EU budget, you have failed dramatically. On behalf of British taxpayers, I hereby request that you lead the demand for a significant reduction of the 2011 budget.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="39769" name="Martin Ehrenhauser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is true that the error rate in the area of cohesion has fallen significantly from 54% in 2007 to 36% in 2009. That is correct. It is a fact, and even I have to acknowledge that. However, as the rapporteur has already said, if you look more closely at how these figures have been produced, it is obvious that they must be seen in relative terms. It is also a fact that, according to this report from the Court of Auditors, the control systems in the area of cohesion are not effective. In addition, it is a fact that at least 3% of the money should not have been paid out at all. This means that there is still a great deal for Mr Hahn to do, among others, to put this portfolio in order.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the increase in the error rates in the area of agriculture is obviously a retrograde step. Furthermore, wastefulness, in cases for example, where subsidies for miners are paid to billionaires, is not counted as an error.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have already mentioned in the committee that I have not received an answer either from the Court of Auditors or from the Commission with regard to the social security benefits which have been paid twice. Once again, my question is: Who made the error in this case? Will the money be paid back and how big is the amount involved? Finally, I would like to say that it is important in future for the Court of Auditors not only to check that payments are being made legally, but also to ensure that they are cost-effective and efficient.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019" speaker_id="96857" name="Cătălin Sorin Ivan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">First of all, I wish to thank Victor Caldeira for this clear report, which is relevant to the Commission’s activities and the implementation of the 2009 budget. Secondly, I want to clarify from the start something of vital importance to us: once every five years, we are elected and sent to the European Parliament by Europe’s citizens, the people who pay taxes and duties and who ultimately make this budget. From their point of view, based on the fact that we regularly go back home and meet with them, the implementation of the 2009 budget cannot be regarded as a success. Let me give you just two reasons for this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, the national management declarations made are not supported politically. In other words, there is no signature either from the minister for finance or the prime minister. As a result, we do not know who is responsible for these national management declarations and to what extent they are comprehensible and accurate. In practical terms, this paves the way for false reporting and, if not false, then at least incomplete.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, where errors have been made in the management of European funds, every state must pay the money back to the Commission. In other words, Europe’s citizens pay money once to create the European budget and, on the other hand, as losers, they again cover the loss in the national budget. Therefore, the citizens of the European Union pay twice for the mistakes, errors or even fraudulent acts committed in the management of European funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thirdly, I support the Commission and the European Court of Auditors. I, too, am in favour of closer ties between this institution and the national audit bodies in each Member State. I believe that if we want to have more money in the budget, we must spend better, in the first place, the money we have. To spend better the money we have, we must first of all know where problems are and how we can solve them.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-020" speaker_id="97129" name="Luigi de Magistris" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years.</p>
      <p sl="it">The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, although the Court of Auditors states that the accountability of European expenditure has improved, it has failed to grant a full declaration of assurance for the expenditure. That is partly because, while some improvement has indeed been shown as regards the second largest item, cohesion, there are still errors in approximately 40% of the projects. Thus, out of a total budget of EUR 35 billion, there are EUR 2 billion for which no declaration of assurance could be granted. I find that unacceptable; the Commission, in particular, should therefore thoroughly investigate how these errors could have arisen and how they might be reduced. This is especially important in consideration of the discharge of the 2009 budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yesterday, Mr Engwirda, a member of the Court, stated that the errors were primarily due to the complexity of the procedures. That again demonstrates that it is imperative that Europe become simpler and more transparent. If that does not happen, our citizens will continue to see Europe as complicated and overly remote.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this?</p>

The real issue for me is that no declaration of assurance can be given for billions of euro, which is why I have asked the Commission to investigate that thoroughly and also to examine how the situation might be improved. Fortunately, the Commissioner has already indicated in his speech a minute ago that he will initiate such an investigation and that he will take the matter seriously.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, estimates provided by the European Court of Auditors show that EUR 6 million disappeared from the European budget in 2009 as a result of carelessness, mismanagement, fraud, ignorance and a lack of checks. The Court of Auditors has revealed the scandalous fact that around 40% of EU officials are receiving double the normal amount of family benefits. Greece is once again causing problems. It has not only been bailed out by other Member States with a rescue package amounting to billions of euro, but is also the front-runner when it comes to subsidy fraud. You only need to look at the wooded areas for which Greece has claimed subsidies for green spaces to see the sheer audacity of its behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, the situation is particularly bad when it comes to the regional subsidies. As the previous speaker has said, if 36% of the payments that were checked were made in error, that is bad enough. This is why we are calling on Mr Hahn to take drastic measures with regard to his very important portfolio. We do not have money to give away.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to compliment the committed employees of the Court of Auditors. They are highly motivated and we politicians should be encouraging them to make even more careful checks. As politicians, we are in a position to draw up and implement guidelines.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I think that in discussing this report, we must take care to be sufficiently precise in our statements, because we are very often also talking, here, about errors, irregularities or embezzlement. The report shows very clearly that in terms of the error rate found for cohesion policy, there has been a definite reduction. It is at a level of around 5%, in relation to which we cannot at the same time talk about errors at a level of 20, 30 or 40%, because this simply confuses the overall picture. We have, here, a clear improvement in what certainly is a very complicated policy, since it is managed jointly with the Member States. A problem for all of us is how to improve this policy, which has a structure which is simply very demanding and very complicated but which has huge added value. The situation is changing, and this should be noted with satisfaction and stated positively.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I would like to draw attention to a certain disturbing part of the report, and I quote: ‘Taking this into consideration, the Court concludes that it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between its own estimate of error rates and the data for financial corrections and recoveries supplied by the Commission.’ I think this statement is very important and significant for the future, because we do not want a situation in which the Court concludes that it cannot reach agreement with the Commission about results. More work is needed, here, and this matter needs to be explained.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for once again providing us with an excellent tool for evaluating our use of money within the EU. Fortunately, we can confirm that we are moving in the right direction, even though there are still many problems. However, because things are moving in the right direction, I think we should use the time to take a closer look at what the next step should be. If we look at the situation with regard to administrative expenditure, for example, we can see that we have an effective control system and few errors. In my opinion, however, this is not enough. We also need to take time to examine whether we are actually using the money in the right way.</p>
      <p sl="da">Administrative expenditure is our expenditure on salaries, buildings and such like. In this regard, we ought to ask ourselves whether we are really getting enough for the money that we spend on salaries. Are we using the money in the right way in respect of how we manage our buildings, etc.? I believe that we now need to take the debate a step further so that we discuss the question of whether it is efficient enough, and so that we also obtain a significantly greater degree of transparency with regard to this. I therefore call not only on the European Parliament, but on the Commission, too, to demonstrate a considerable willingness to provide greater transparency and to engage in this debate.</p>

In the first place, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr da Silva Caldeira and his team for the work they have done. On the other hand, I am surprised at the level of error that is again occurring in almost 92% of budget expenditure, counting all chapters with the exception of administrative expenditure and economic affairs. I would like to ask to what extent are the Member States responsible for these errors and to what extent is a lack of control on the part of the Commission responsible.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The answer indicated in the report is that there are many deficiencies in the actual control systems of the Member States. I believe that what we need most of all is greater cooperation and openness from the Member States, if such large-scale errors are to be prevented.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, the Court of Auditors have done an excellent job drafting the report auditing the EU budget for 2009, and Mr Caldeira and the members of the Court of Auditors deserve credit for their work. I agree with those speakers who have said that the report shows clearly and unambiguously that there is an improving trend as regards the use of EU funds and that the overall error rate is falling. Nevertheless, we need to draw clear and obvious consequences from the report as to what we have to do here in Parliament, in the Commission and in the other EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The falling error rate, however, means nothing less than that, according to the Court of Auditors, several billion euro of EU funds have been used incorrectly or irregularly, which may even give rise to the suspicion of crime. This means that action has to be taken. There is one measure in particular which I would like to mention, namely, that it would be extremely important that the Court of Auditors prepare a breakdown by Member States in the next period to show the extent of the error rate in the use of EU funds and the standard of operation of the control mechanism in each state. This, too, may contribute to a further reduction in the error rate.</p>

      <p sl="es">I also think that Mr da Silva Caldeira’s proposal for the future regarding cooperation to improve and simplify the important aspects of the Financial Regulation is very positive, as are the new legislative proposals on which we could perhaps work together to achieve a successful result.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the other institutions, I will be paying very close attention to all the aspects related to the Council’s operating expenditure, especially the Secure European System for Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment system, in which there is a specific reference to the need for improvements in forecasting the Council’s budget, and also to isolated aspects relating to the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, whose budgets appear to be severely reduced. I am also interested, however, in the fact that we have had information that a case has been passed on to the European Anti-Fraud Office in relation to the Economic and Social Committee.

      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, it is vitally important that we emphasise the fact that the Court of Auditors’ conclusions acknowledge the progress which has been made by the Commission in controlling the absorption of European funds. However, at the same time, I hope that the recommendations and proposals made by the European Parliament in the discharge reports, reiterated for years on end, will actually be taken into consideration, especially in the areas where we still have a high level of irregularities. The quality of the information supplied to us by the Court of Auditors should be even better as well. I believe that we should really be given the precise figures and level of irregularities which we need to know.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The good news for 2009 is that the level of irregularities in the area of cohesion policy has fallen significantly compared to last year. However, the big question remains whether this reduction will be sustainable over time or is simply a fluke which may also be due to the specific countries chosen to be audited.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, in any event, there are unresolved issues on the agenda, linked to irregularities in the areas of external aid, development and enlargement, agriculture, research, energy and transport, education and citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I want to assure the Court of Auditors, the Commission and Council that our work in the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control will be very extensively and essentially focused over the coming months on making the management of European funds more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We will continue to emphasise the responsibilities which need to be assumed in this regard by the European Commission and Member States and strictly adhered to, as well as the measures to be taken against offenders in order to achieve a real result in protecting the interests of the European taxpayer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it.

Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Looking at the error rate, I see that a clear improvement has been made in terms of cohesion. We can now see the impact of the new regulations we adopted for the 2007-2013 period and of the action plans which were keenly advocated, not only by Parliament, but also by both the current and previous Commission. Most of the problems, or errors, are to be found in the public procurement dossier. Transposition of European legislation into the laws of a number of Member States and the associated implementation have driven up the error rate to its present very high level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore ask the Commissioners to come up with an action plan that would, amongst other things, put pressure on Member States or support them with regard to public procurement. Last week, I had the opportunity of heading a European Parliament delegation to Romania and we were able to see how they were struggling with this and what kind of difficulties they were up against. We could make a lot of progress here.</p>

There are many examples where this can be done by the Commission, by Member States and by beneficiaries in order to improve matters, for example, in agriculture. Constant changes in requirements by the Commission cause difficulties for Member States and beneficiaries; in Wales, they tell me that all the time. To reduce claims for ineligible land by farmers, the Commission could also provide legislation which clearly defines active farmers across the EU, which would then be used by all Member States, whereas at the moment, they have some discretion. Lastly, with CAP reform imminent, there is a golden opportunity to simplify the processes to ensure that in Europe, we have value for money for our spending, but also continue to provide benefits for individuals and communities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, presentation of the results of the European Court of Auditors’ work always gives superb information which enables a comparison of what things were like in the past with what should be done in the future. What can the general conclusion be? It seems to be the case that wherever procedures are less complicated and it is easier to use money, we find fewer material errors. The more complicated the policy, the more the significance of errors, and sometimes also of irregularities, rises. One such example is cohesion policy, which is also very important for the European Union. This is why it has also been concluded, here, that the Union’s agricultural policy has a high error rate, but where procedures for the use of funds have been simplified, there are fewer errors than where it is more complicated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw attention to the significance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies, but also – and this has not been spoken about – the significance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with committees for European affairs, budgets and budgetary control.

This report is an impressive demonstration of the fact that the controls are constantly improving. I am not necessarily concerned by the error rates that have been highlighted, because I believe that the auditing process is a learning system. It involves looking more and more closely at the problems and, thank goodness, discovering an increasing number of errors. Our task is to work together to avoid these errors occurring in future. Therefore, I would like to draw everyone’s attention once again to the Fifth Cohesion Report which was presented yesterday. The Commission is inviting everyone involved to express their opinions about the questions raised in this document. This represents a major opportunity to lay the foundations for future subsidy arrangements which will ensure, on the one hand, that subsidies in this area are easier to obtain, that access is simplified and red tape reduced, and that, on the other, the necessary strict controls are in place to protect the taxpayers’ money which is being used.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the debate today demonstrates that further progress was achieved in 2009 in the management of the European budget. The clear opinion of the Court on the accounts and the lowest error rate ever for the whole budget, as disclosed by our external auditor, confirm that the Commission took the right decisions and proposed adequate measures to improve the performance of the programmes under the current financial period.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Court also highlights the areas where further progress is needed by all financial actors. I refer, of course, to the Commission, and also to financial actors in the Member States whose obligations and responsibilities under shared management have been clearly reinforced under the new Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you talked here about the application of sanctions to the Member States, and I have to say that the Commission applies sanctions very rigorously. Just now, we are in the process of the suspension or interruption of 40 cohesion programmes amounting to EUR 1.75 billion. That is a huge amount, and what is more important is that the number of actions in 2010 almost doubled compared with the number of actions in 2009. Just last Friday, we also made a decision to call back unduly spent money in agriculture to an amount of more than EUR 578 million; so we really apply these sanctions rigorously and we intend to do so in the future. You can also see from the report by the Court of Auditors that the level of recoveries and financial corrections has increased significantly over the years, amounting in 2009 to EUR 3.3 billion. That is also a very significant amount, and our intention is to continue this policy and apply sanctions very rigorously when this is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court’s report, and the discharge procedures starting now, will be instrumental not only in addressing the weaknesses of the current programmes but also in drawing lessons for the next generation of programmes. The Court rightly pointed out the way forward, which is, of course, simplification and improvements in the procurement rules, because it is true that the vast majority of errors were made because of the violation of eligibility criteria or of procurement rules. We have to learn lessons from this, and the Commission is ready to do so. It will follow up on the Court’s recommendations and is looking forward to a fruitful discharge procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for all the kind comments that you have addressed to the Court on this occasion, as a tribute also to those who work in our institution each day addressing, with the highest professional standards, and in accordance with international audit standards, the concerns of this institution. We pay due attention to the recommendations of this House and let me just give you two examples of what we have done in this annual report for 2009 to address the request from this institution for more information.</p>
      <p sl="en">We provide you with an overall assessment of the situation; for the first time, we say what the overall situation is. We conclude that it has improved over recent years; the most likely errors for the whole budget are decreasing. We have also provided you, in particular in the area of cohesion, with more information than last year, because last year we said that at least 11% of the funds should not have been paid; this year, we are able to say that the most likely error estimated is indeed over 5%, which we could not say last year, and that at least 3% of the funds should not have been reimbursed. This is the measure of the progress we have found. These are facts. Why? What are the reasons behind this? What progress have we achieved? We are not inventing facts; we are not being kind to the Commission or kind to the Member States. The Court is an independent audit institution governed by the treaty. We base our findings on the evidence and it is what we report to this institution, which we have the obligation to assist in this discharge procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are willing to assist you in this work and the main reason for this, as we said in our report, is that on the one hand, the systems put in place to manage the funds for this programme period 2007-2013 are performing better. The other reason is that the disbursement of funds for the programming period is only 25%, so the financial execution for the period is, in our evidence, lower than what should be expected. So the combination of these two factors – better performance of the systems on the one hand and lower execution, so fewer payments effectively made, on the other – has given us the situation where we now are. This is where we have this word of caution. We have to see how things evolve now with the systems behaving so well across all the 27 Member States and with all the funds to be disbursed in the future. So a word of caution.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I said that we are willing to assist this House, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control, in its discharge. Our Members will assist you with that and provide you with all the information you need. But we are also assisting you through our special reports. You can find audits and other elements which look at the impact of the funding in real life, at how effectively they have been used, and I think that this is very valuable information for this institution also.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, the responsibility for implementing the budget lies primarily with the European Commission, but the Lisbon Treaty says also in cooperation with the Member States. If we have to look forward, I would say that we now have a unique opportunity to build a new momentum for a better management of the European Union budget. A new Financial Regulation is being discussed and will be adopted soon and that will be the basic line to decide and guide the management for future progress. If we have to have simple rules, if we want to have more efficient, cost-effective systems to manage them through the Member States and within the Commission, that is the moment to address those issues. The budget review is also on the table next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament are therefore confronted now with a period for taking serious decisions to improve the situation in the future. If the European Court of Auditors can assist in that, I would suggest it should be by building on the recommendations that we have already put forward in our opinion on the key risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you look to the new generation of programmes for the period after 2013, I repeat, we have to ask: are the programmes of funding schemes likely to add value to the European Union? Are we putting forward schemes which are simple, with clear objectives, realistic to execute and whose accountability lines are clear? We want to avoid the uncertainty where we are sometimes claiming that there is no responsibility either on the side of the Commission or on the side of the Member States. We have the opportunity now and the Court of Auditors is looking forward to assisting you in this task.</p>

This is the end of a cycle that began with the Santer Commission, which resigned in 1999. This situation is due to the determination of the European Parliament and of its Committee on Budgetary Control to force the Commission and also the Member States – in matters relating to shared management – to manage European public funds correctly.

I fail to understand why the Union does not enter into its accounts the EUR 37.2 billion that the Member States owe for staff pensions, since it has approximately EUR 44 billion negative own capital as a result. What an image to portray! I wonder how we are going to be able to borrow on the markets to raise the EUR 60 billion needed for the stability plan.

For example, the Court of Auditors states that, for projects in the area of cohesion, the level of error is higher than 5%, which, in my opinion, is too high, despite the fact that there has been an improvement in recent years. In my opinion, the European Commission should make every effort to reduce the error level to the maximum acceptable level of 2%. It has to be said, of course, that the error level does not always indicate incorrect handling of delegated resources, but is often down to accounting errors in the administration of individual projects.</p>

The European Police College (CEPOL) is one of the entities for which the due information has been lacking for several years. This has important consequences, because, after an in-depth audit of CEPOL’s accounts in July 2010, corrections were made to the accounts. Indeed, the 2009 financial report for the agency went back over the accounting management of the financial years 2008 and earlier, estimating the budgetary impact of the corrections at approximately 13% of the agency’s current budget. Since the college became a community agency on 1 January 2006, the Court of Auditors has only issued reservations on the reliability of the accounts for the financial year 2007.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a very happy rapporteur, because I think that we – and I very much emphasise the we – have produced a report that will hopefully soon be adopted almost unanimously, as all political groups in Parliament have worked intensively on it and in close cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report and the regulations it addresses have a lengthy history in this House. It had its origins, specifically, in the recovery plan launched in 2009 in the wake of the economic crisis. At the time, EUR 4 billion was freed up at European level, and these funds were earmarked specifically for economic recovery. The objective was that that money should also finance energy projects in particular: large-scale energy projects, devoted to carbon capture and storage, to infrastructure, and to a number of large offshore wind energy projects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At that time, Parliament having of course approved these projects, there were quite a few objections from various quarters and from Parliament itself, especially vis-à-vis the large-scale nature of the undertaking and the question of whether this or that project would create enough jobs. However, the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency. This was followed by a political agreement and the current situation is the result of that agreement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You would think that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission reach a political agreement about investing all surpluses in energy efficiency, that the report and the negotiations would be easy. That was not the case. We have been through some difficult negotiations, especially with the Council. However, I can say that we – and we did have to reach a compromise, let us be clear about that – were able to score a home run on most of the points. I would like to run through them briefly because they are crucial to a proper understanding of the current situation concerning the funds and how they should be implemented in the very near future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, this is about renewable energy projects but, in particular, those which focus on energy efficiency. That, Commissioner, is what lies at the heart of the energy debate these days. I am very much in favour of renewable energy, but we know that, if we want really rapid results, we have to invest all our efforts in energy efficiency: it is a good solution if you want to reduce consumption; it helps alleviate the major problem of energy supply and – a very important point – it ensures lower energy costs for our companies and families. That is incredibly important. We are also working on industrial policy and we will definitely get back to you on that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, and this is very much linked to energy efficiency, the local level. Very often, Europe works almost exclusively with national Member States, and even the previous recovery plan focused primarily on major projects. Well, this one could not be more different. It focuses on the local level, on cities and municipalities, on small-scale projects which can be implemented immediately, delivering immediate results, and which can thereby have a major impact, not just on energy efficiency but also on jobs. That remains a very important consideration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, funding. The previous major recovery plan consisted of what we call upfront funding; simply subsidising major projects, whether by means of cofinancing or not, because that is specific to Europe. It is the typical way in which Europe works. However, that is not the case with this fund and, for that reason, it is very innovative. The way resources are used here is by providing support in order to get those projects funded through guarantees and other financial means. With the exception of technical assistance, which is still funded through upfront funding, this means that you will have major leveraging. You need to multiply those EUR 146 million by approximately eight in order to get an idea of what the impact could be.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have now come to my last point, over which we have squabbled for a long time: the cap on money; that is, the money that is available to us. Parliament would have liked to see a different solution; which, indeed, was what we had agreed, let us be clear about that. Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project. We have reached a compromise: all the funds that are left over today have been registered and I firmly believe that this will mean that this project will be assured a long life – and I think that, if we carry on working together as we have done, we will also be able to ensure that it becomes incredibly successful for us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Just one more second, Madam President. I know I have run out of time. I would once again like to expressly thank everyone who has worked on this, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs. I was particularly pleased with our cooperation, and I am not saying that out of politeness, but simply because it was an example of very fine and effective cooperation. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are discussing the interim review of a successful programme to aid economic recovery in the energy sector. Up to this point, as part of the implementation of the programme established for us by Parliament and the Council, we have made 43 financing decisions for gas projects, energy infrastructure projects, offshore energy and carbon capture and storage. This has allowed us to spend around 98% of the entire budget of EUR 3.98 billion and to ensure that the programme has, to a large extent, achieved its objectives. There were only a few projects which could not be implemented. We are introducing this amendment regulation with the aim of meeting Parliament’s requirements and initiating pilot projects for renewable energy, but importantly, also for energy efficiency. I regard these pilot projects as an opportunity to trial our activities in the field of energy efficiency, which will be one of the focal points of my work over the next year.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt very warmly. I would also like to thank all the strident Members of this House and the Belgian Presidency, because we have worked hard in this area over recent weeks and we are able to present a document today which will definitely provide a stimulus in the area of energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to ensure that this amendment regulation, which is due to come into force now, takes effect quickly, our officials have already been making preparations for its implementation. In the next few days, EUR 146 million will be made available for projects which are important to all of you. Our partners in these projects, chosen by you, are municipal, local and regional authorities which have close links with the projects in question. These local partners will ensure that the funding is used in the best possible way, for public buildings, private buildings, combined heat and power facilities, district heating networks, decentralised renewable energy sources, more environmentally friendly urban transport systems and local infrastructures, such as intelligent networks, efficient street lighting and smart measurement systems. This means that we are doing something which will have an immediate local impact and which will act as a benchmark for my future activities relating to smart cities.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you make the appropriate decision today, our offices will begin implementing the amendment regulation straight away. In March or April of next year, we will definitely be able to report that our economic recovery programme is having a very positive effect, in the form of both large projects and small, decentralised projects, and is allowing us to learn lessons which will be important in future financial years. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the decision to use the few remaining funds in the Recovery Plan started in 2009 in a different way and to take advantage of this opportunity to introduce a new principle with the setting up of an ad hoc fund is far-sighted and in line with what we have been saying for some time in this Chamber but have never been able to act on.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have seen a few timid signs, not yet brought up to date, in the Marguerite Fund. This represents, for us and for the PPE, a benchmark method to be followed for intelligent use of the European Union budget. The instrument is an ad hoc fund that deploys various methods such as loans, guarantees, equity shares or cofinancing, and will be governed by a special asset management company.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fund was set up with an initial sum of EUR 147 million and we do not understand why the door cannot be left open for the other residues due to the Recovery Plan. A significant sum could be raised by applying significant leverage through the EIB, the KfW, the Deposit and Loan Banks and other financial institutions, and this could have a great impact on the start-up of projects considered valid and given economic and environmental priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">From my point of view, the central aspect of the fund that will be set up by the end of this year is that it could become a kind of virtuous pilot project for the future organisation of a broader energy fund for appropriate inclusion in the next financial perspective 2014-2020. This principle could also be repeated for other sectors, such as TEN or eTEN networks. If you would allow me, some tangible sign at this critical time in the face of an employment crisis would make us all a little happier.</p>

      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur explained, we are going to allocate funds to sustainable energy micro-projects, which will not only enable the realisation of important objectives such as security of supply and reducing CO2 emissions, but will also achieve an objective that has a very direct impact on the population: reducing energy poverty.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the preparation of this report on energy projects and for the additional funds now provided by the Commission. EUR 146 million has been provided for projects which will be crucial for Europe and for the various countries and, in particular, as the Commissioner has said, for the local and regional authorities which will, I hope, be handling this money or these grants.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I first of all want to congratulate the rapporteur on the presentation of her report on financial assistance for energy projects.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I strongly welcome this initiative, which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in Europe, and indeed in my own country, Ireland, and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In all parts of Europe now, and particularly in my own country with a very high rate of unemployment, we want to ensure that all funding can be diverted into areas where jobs can be created. The funding of EUR 146 million which is available under the amended proposal must be targeted towards projects that will have a rapid, a measurable and a real impact on economic recovery. EUR 146 million is the funding that is available, but there is a multiplier of at least six or seven times that amount, which will be the overall investment.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I believe that the establishment of a dedicated financial instrument will allow for this funding to be administered in the most efficient manner and the beneficiaries, as I said in my own native language, will include local and regional authorities. We all have a responsibility to bring this to the attention of those authorities, and our government will be making an individual application and then liaise with the regional authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we celebrate a victory, albeit small, for green energy policy and a more European energy policy. I firstly want to thank our excellent delegation from all parties, under the leadership of Kathleen. I think we did a good job.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to praise Mr Oettinger. Unfortunately, during the presentation of the energy agenda yesterday, we were obliged to be highly critical. However, this instrument has also come about because you have made a personal effort, in part in the face of opposition from the German Government and your partners in the Christian-Democratic Union in Germany, to ensure that it was able to happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is it a small and bitter victory? Because – and some have said this – this is EUR 150 million for the decentralised, the local, energy investments, where, on the other hand, we have billions – one billion for carbon sequestration, for example. I am still wondering if this one billion will be used. We are getting increasing indications that this project will not work. There is no balance between the decentralised, near-to-the-citizens, local-area projects and the big projects, some of which will, I think, fail.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why are we, as Greens, nevertheless voting for this project today? It is because we are optimists. We are optimistic that this EUR 150 million, well managed, will create the base for a much bigger instrument which we will get under the next financial perspective. There are two conditions for that. The first condition is quality projects. I think that the EIB and KfW, which will manage it, will also look at deep renovation, and not only shallow renovation, projects. We need to leapfrog, especially when it comes to buildings and efficiency. The second condition is cutting the red tape for the local authorities that will apply for projects to get cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="de">These two issues are crucial. Therefore, my questions to you, Commissioner, are: what will the Commission do to make sure that this fund will finance or give credit to quality projects? And how will the Commission act to cut red tape so that local authorities have easy access to these funds?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I will endorse every proposal to increase Union funds for supporting energy projects. Green energy should also be supported. However, it should be said honestly that the idea that green energy is the solution to all of Europe’s energy problems – a kind of thinking which is often expressed here – is an illusion. However, the Union does need large, and I stress large, investments. The basic purpose of these is to ensure diversification of fuel supply. Such a solution is possible, for example, by building the Nabucco gas pipeline to connect the huge gas deposits in the region of Central Asia with customers in Europe and by developing transmission networks and building new interconnectors in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We do want to develop green energy, but at the same time, unfortunately, development of methods for extraction of shale gas is being completely overlooked and is not being appropriately funded. This is an unconventional gas which is already playing an enormous role in extraction in the United States and is giving America complete independence in terms of access to gas. Large amounts of this gas are found in France, Poland and Bulgaria. Here, in the face of the opportunity to use this great potential, complete passivity is to be seen. European solidarity requires that the Union support these projects as strategic for its future and as projects which guarantee the uniform development of all European states. It is a pity we are not talking, today, about great investments which will really solve our energy problems and unite and develop the European Union. While we are talking about important measures related to green energy, let us, however, remember that the idea that green energy will solve our energy problems is an illusion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I, too, would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has done on this subject. We are here to discuss a very specific programme to aid economic recovery, which is in the crucial area of energy in this case. In the current crisis situation that we are experiencing, proposals such as this one that help create jobs are essential. There is no chance of restructuring the economy if we do not make job creation our priority. This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs. We are in a period when we are debating, and will debate a great deal more, a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy, and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large-scale projects and networks, forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I believe that this report could help us not only to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is very important, but also to provide concrete benefits for local communities, which naturally means concrete benefits for the European public as a whole. That is why, Madam President, I wish to conclude with two final points: it is important never to forget that energy efficiency is also achieved, to a large extent, by cutting energy use through microgeneration projects like those included in this report; and, finally, it was a great victory for this House to ensure that the amount of financing to be allocated to these projects would be specified. That was not what we were aiming for, because we needed much more. I would therefore ask the Commissioner what he is seeking to do and intends to do to guarantee these needs.</p>

The support for measures in the construction industry to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, which annually consume up to 40% of energy in the EU, shows the justification for, and good sense of, this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Funding to cover the activities of this financial instrument may be obtained by transferring unused resources from a number of programmes in which it is not objectively possible to use the allocated funding in time to the planned extent. An example of this would be the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which has a financial reserve of around EUR 150 million, as well as the multi-year GR programme for the climate sector, which was set up with a similar aim. I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we might best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and, it would seem, necessary, single purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables.</p>

      <p sl="cs">If we are to dispel the suspicion that the newly established fund is targeted mainly at those who have not used the resources allocated within the EUR 5 billion package of the economic recovery programme due to non-implementation of projects, representatives of the new Member States should also be included in the selection process. The fund may be primarily intended for local and regional authorities, but we should also consider whether it would not be appropriate to allow private entities to apply as well, and not just where they are acting on behalf of public bodies.

      <p sl="it">The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures. Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments. This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, financial assistance for energy efficiency and renewable energy with the objective of economic recovery represents sensible and worthwhile investment.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I totally agree with those who said that investment support for sustainable energy can be very effective and very beneficial, particularly when focused on the local level. By this means, we can provide a more sustainable future economically, socially and environmentally speaking. We must seize this opportunity to move towards a low carbon economy and facilitate the change for those who wish to change. Decentralisation is very important for sustainable energy.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Therefore, this is a sensible, functional use of the unspent funds of the European Energy Programme for Recovery, if the opportunity is provided of facilitating the funding of investment projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy through local and regional authorities.

      <p sl="lt">Assistance for energy infrastructure projects from money earmarked to stimulate the European Union economy was debated and allocated a year ago. At that time, the money was intended for just two types of projects, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As far as this assistance and assistance for renewable energy in general is concerned, we generally cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach for the whole European Union. We must take into account the situation of each Member State, in particular, as regards energy independence. I therefore welcome the European Commission’s proposal to review the procedures for the allocation of money according to the programme mentioned, taking into account the promotion of energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, I feel that we should not talk about this purely in the context of the financial crisis, because even once a normal economic cycle has been restored, the issue of energy efficiency will remain. The Member States should have the opportunity to react with more flexibility to changing circumstances and thus promote energy efficiency, energy diversification and an increase in energy independence.</p>

Credit lines that are able to complement worthy local initiatives are needed. Our preference must be for the financing of projects that also guarantee technological innovation to raise the competitiveness of industry.

      <p sl="pl">In January 2009, in response to the financial crisis, the European Commission proposed the reallocation of EUR 5 billion from unspent European Union funds, mostly to support energy projects which would contribute to economic recovery in the European Union. The European Energy Programme for Recovery, which is now being proposed, should be welcomed. Priority issues in this project are, in my opinion, support for cross-border gas and electricity infrastructure projects, including inter-connectors, and also support for Carbon Capture and Storage projects. I also consider it necessary to insist that the draft resolution also include projects in the area of electrical efficiency and renewable energy sources, which stimulate economic development by creating opportunities for additional jobs and help in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Investments made in projects of this kind are most efficient when they are undertaken on site at district, regional and local level. Local projects involve a large amount of work, and this contributes to the creation of large numbers of new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this EUR 146 million, we are entering an experimental laboratory together. Firstly, I would like to say thank you, because you have fought to ensure that it was not EUR 114 million, but EUR 146 million, and that the Member States were prepared to go slightly beyond their rather restrictive limit.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the experimental laboratory is concerned, we have four interesting questions to resolve. The first question is how we can achieve success in the field of energy efficiency. I believe that, of the three requirements relating to CO2, renewable energy and energy efficiency, the 20% increase in energy efficiency presents us with the most difficult and complex challenge. This is not just about mandatory national requirements, but about specific projects. Basically, we are using this manageable programme to evaluate which projects, such as building renovation projects and those relating to the field of energy in general, will be feasible. I hope that in two or three years, the first assessment of these projects for the next budget period will show that we have had some useful positive and negative experiences with regard to energy efficiency. I would like to make it clear that in two to three years, we will definitely be more knowledgeable than we are today and that we will have had some good experiences and made some mistakes. If this is the case, we will have invested the money wisely.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, this programme allows the European Union to enter into a direct partnership with the municipalities. This is something which does not happen every day. It is clear that the energy requirements and consumption in public buildings and in private buildings that can be renovated, in other words, a smart city approach, can only be influenced by the EU via the municipalities. This means having direct contact with what is actually happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I hope that we will be able to demonstrate with this programme that there is European added value for everyone. If we were only to obtain money from the Member States without providing any added value, we would be unnecessary. We must offer added value in the form of experience, effectiveness and competence. In this case, within two years, this programme will give us good arguments that we can use in the budget debates – a poker game involving the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – to obtain more money from the Member States in the interests of all the citizens of the European Union. This means that this is also an experimental laboratory for more budget funding. This controversial issue will affect every one of us over the next two years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, we need an experimental laboratory for our partnership with the structural banks – the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW Bankengruppe – and with external private investors and funds. This means a partnership that goes beyond the Commission’s offices with companies which have a close relationship with us, but which must demonstrate that they can do more than just manage public money.</p>
      <p sl="de">This may seem like a large amount of funding, but in fact, it is very little. This is not about the EUR 146 million. It is about a four-way test of our partnership with the municipalities, with the EIB and KfW, with the subject of energy efficiency at a local level, and with the proof that at a European level, this is the right area for more budget funding.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, I would like to thank you very much. Let us stay in contact. I am sure that in two years, we will all know much more than we do now.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, as a Belgian Member of this House, it was a real pleasure for me to come here to work on a public holiday. As a result, I was able to reach the European Parliament from my home town in just 50 minutes, but that is entirely by the by.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As rapporteur, I will be brief. Let me thank everyone, without exception, who has contributed to the debate today. We have heard some comments and very many good examples have been given. However, the connecting thread here is the enthusiasm over what we have achieved. Not without criticism, because I could very easily criticise the cap on money that has been set.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is a great deal of enthusiasm because this a good fund, because the money is available, because this is about energy efficiency and renewable energy and because this gives us, as Members of the European Parliament, the opportunity to take local action, too, through this project. That is what is needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is our common responsibility? In the first instance, of course, responsibility lies with the Commission, the European Investment Bank and other partners in this story. However, Parliament and us politicians are also responsible for ensuring that this project becomes a success, that it has a canvassing effect, and that involvement at local level becomes so large that the EUR 146 million multiplies not by eight but by 80, so to speak, because we have set many things in motion. In that regard, I have a lot of confidence in the Commission and the Commissioner. I know that this is a project which is close to the Commissioner’s heart. He also has very good staff – as I have seen for myself over the past few months – and that will be very important for the outcome of this project.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude – I forgot to say it earlier, which is really remiss of me, particularly as a Belgian – I would make the point that the Belgian Presidency has given an exceptional account of itself here. To begin with, from the outset, a large majority in the Council was actually against this project. It is thanks to the major efforts of Minister Paul Magnette and his team that we now have a very good compromise and one that we will soon, I think, also adopt with a great deal of enthusiasm.</p>

      <p sl="it">In January 2009, the European Commission proposed reallocating a portion of unused European finance to support projects in the energy sector in response to the economic and financial crisis. Our discussion today on the report amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is of particular importance: the proposal to use otherwise unused financial resources to support sector projects represents an opportunity in these times of difficult access to funding. In my opinion, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which aims to finance initiatives and projects in the sector of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, supporting the investment of European public authorities, in particular, in urban settings, can give a tangible stimulus to the recovery of the European economy and the creation of job opportunities for young people. I am encouraged by measures on energy efficiency in the building sector, which uses 40% of EU energy, and that would represent a support to small and medium-sized enterprises at local and regional level. This assistance would also favour the development of promising initiatives in the energy efficiency sector at the level of local authorities which, due to the recent crisis, have suffered a drastic reduction in revenue.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, last year I, too, welcomed the allocation of almost EUR 4 billion for projects in the field of energy as part of the Union’s economic stimulus package. I also pointed out that the aid package neglected the Central and Eastern European region, which is most threatened from the aspect of energy security, and that energy efficiency projects did not benefit from the aid either. However, it would have been precisely through energy efficiency projects that the main objective of the package, namely rapid and effective job creation, could have been achieved. I am pleased that the new proposal allocates as yet unused funds to this very field. Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are not only among the main means of achieving the 20/20/20 targets, but also increase supply security and competitiveness. These projects bring impressive results in the short term as well. They create new jobs in a geographically diverse manner and effectively dynamise economic actors. Spending the EUR 146 million fund on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects is a good start but we must admit that this amount is insignificant even at Member State level. We are very pleased that the Energy 2020 strategy unveiled by the Commission yesterday sets out the creation of an energy-efficient Europe as one of its main priorities. We trust that the strategic commitment to energy efficiency will also be reflected in the distribution of other funds.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Energy Programme for Recovery provides a financial package amounting to EUR 3.98 billion for 2009 and 2010. It was absolutely imperative to create a financial instrument specially intended for using the funds in this energy programme, which could not be committed until the end of 2010, so as not to lose the remainder of the financial package. One particularly important aspect mentioned in the European Energy Programme Regulation is the geographical balance of the projects. This is a key element enabling the impact of this regulation on the economic recovery to be guaranteed across the whole of the European Union. It also acknowledges that there were projects in some Member States which were either not financed at all or only partially financed. Last but not least, I want to emphasise how important it is to renew these types of financial instruments aimed at promoting long-term energy efficiency in the EU. I call on the Commission to assess carefully the effectiveness of renewing these types of instruments and to examine the potential of using a similar approach in the future when dealing with other unspent funds from the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The opportunity to direct funds not spent according to the directive towards the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects was already set out in the regulation, but I welcome the fact that it was possible to find consensus as regards its specific implementation. Energy efficiency and renewable energy have frequently been named as EU priorities helping to implement the 2020 strategy and ensure energy security. Investments in this sector during the economic downturn are very important, as they will create a possibility for new jobs and will promote competitiveness, the spread of innovations and economic stability. Furthermore, the financial instrument planned – like the setting-up of a fund for European financial institutions – will increase the amount available several times over, thus increasing opportunities to finance projects. It is only regrettable that the financial instrument planned is not continuous, but hopefully it will establish a suitable incentive for further energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now.</p>
      <p sl="es">The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living.</p>
      <p sl="es">With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-085" speaker_id="1318" name="James Nicholson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I welcome the fact that this issue is being discussed here today. I think it is very timely. At present, the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors, including rising production costs, competition from imports from third countries, and, of course, various issues which contribute to the rising cost of feed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia, I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its lack of self-sufficiency regarding protein crops. We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves. However, the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long, and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up. If this does not happen, livestock producers across the European Union will have to cope with rising prices, volatility and uncertainty for a long time to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry. Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely, as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling. I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beef producers, sheep producers, pig producers, poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss. Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering? But I have to say that ultimately, it will be the consumer who will pay because, if all the farmers stop producing, you are going to have to import this food from abroad, with all the problems this entails. So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe. If we do not do that, it will be at our own peril.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-086" speaker_id="28298" name="Iratxe García Pérez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, the profitability of livestock production is directly linked to feed costs. In the growing context of volatile raw materials prices, decision making is becoming very complex for feed manufacturers and livestock breeders, as we saw at the start of the political year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The meat sector that is having the most difficult time is currently the pork sector. Therefore, I will focus my speech on the serious problems it is facing: the increase in the cost of animal feed, which represents 60% of production costs, and is therefore crucially important in terms of profitability for producers.</p>
      <p sl="es">In two months, cereal prices have risen by 50%, not due to an imbalance between supply and demand, as there is sufficient production, but due to speculation from outside the sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">Action must therefore be taken against speculation, along with a policy encouraging the holding of sufficient strategic stock to avoid speculation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We welcome the fact that grain intervention stocks are being put on the market. We just have to hope that their final destination will be the EU market, otherwise they will not help the livestock sector. A tax on exporting European cereal, as in the case of wheat in 1994, would be a possible solution.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another problem is the pressure of mass distribution with falling prices, which means that increases in production costs cannot be regained from the sale price.</p>
      <p sl="es">Producers’ organisations need to be promoted that are capable of positioning themselves in the market, concentrating supply. The Commission is very much aware of the problem, but there is a lack of specific measures, which we hope will materialise in the future common agricultural policy, through efficient and flexible market management mechanisms to combat and act against the problems. This means combating speculation and using specific measures to promote the competitiveness of the sector in the market and increase its weight in the value chain.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for the activation of the market measures applicable to pork, export refunds and private storage. The Commission does not think that the situation in the sector justifies this. However, in recent months, there has been a continuous decline in prices, and the prices received by breeders are below the average for the last five years.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe it is justifiable for the Commission to trigger the existing market management measures, as some Member States have requested in the Council.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-087" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my answer will be in two parts, because the problem in the livestock sector relates primarily to the food situation and, hence, to the situation in the cereals market, and then I will also refer to the mechanisms at our disposal for the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is following the situation in the cereals markets and its repercussions for farmers very closely. Cereal prices increased sharply over the summer due to supply shortages, particularly in the Black Sea countries. Thus, we have seen the price of barley and oats rise to as much as EUR 200 per tonne. At present, even though prices are very volatile, they are still well below the record prices of 2008. The strength of the euro against the dollar, which makes EU exports less competitive right now, is also a disruptive factor in the European market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Globally, despite the shortage recorded in Russia and Ukraine, the level of cereals harvested is normal, and stocks have been replenished thanks to the last two record harvests. In the European Union, average cereal production is estimated at 276 million tonnes, and if we add to that the stock from the start of the harvest, we have almost 60 million tonnes more than we are expected to use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The grain intervention stocks, which mainly consist of barley, currently stand at 5.6 million tonnes. A 2.8 million tonne batch has just been set aside for the implementation of the 2011 programme to help the poorest citizens, and the rest will be sold on the internal market shortly. The decision has, in fact, already been taken, and the cereals will be placed on the market at the end of this month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The pressure on the market has eased somewhat since the Commission announced this measure, which I recently announced to the Council. With regard to the situation in the cereals market, then, no emergency measure can be justified because, as I explained to you, the problem is not one of supplying the European market with cereals, since the high price of cereals on the European market is not due to a lack of market supply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is paying very close attention to market developments in the livestock sector, and more particularly in the pigmeat and poultry production sectors. The margins in this sector are, in fact, highly dependent on the costs of foodstuffs. Prices in the poultry sector are above the long-term average and appear to be at least partially offsetting the increased food costs. The price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend. It is very slightly below last year’s level. Production is currently well absorbed by the internal market and exports. Between June and August 2010, pigmeat exports were up by 10% and poultry exports by 21% compared with the same period last year. Consequently, despite these price issues, pigmeat and poultry producers have still been able to export for some time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will obviously continue to monitor developments in the market and will use the means at its disposal to intervene in the market if this proves necessary and useful. Indeed, two measures are currently available for the livestock sector: export refunds and private storage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to export refunds, this measure would not be effective at present because the world price is rather high; therefore, an export subsidy cannot be justified. The relationship between the dollar and the euro means that export problems and a lack of competitiveness are possible, but this problem is not exclusive to the agricultural sector. We shall see how the rate between the dollar and the euro changes, and depending on that change, if we have surpluses in the internal market, we can then discuss private storage measures. For the moment, there are no meat surpluses in the internal market, and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present. However, I am willing to consider the possibility of resorting to these measures depending on how the markets evolve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of volatility, this will be addressed in the common agricultural policy reform for 2013. It is envisaged that this reform will include proposals for as yet non-existent mechanisms to address the issue of income volatility. As for the issue of transparency in the food chain, I am currently examining it with Commissioner Tajani to see how more information in this area could help clarify the way in which added value is shared out. Those are the answers I am able to give at this stage.</p>

Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products.</p>

      <p sl="it">We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU. This sector is central to the socio-economic contribution made by agriculture to the rural areas of the European Union. It is a key agri-industry in Europe and even more so in Ireland, as Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">In particular, the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers, who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports. There are three issues in particular that I wish to highlight: firstly, the necessity that the Commission put in place efficient and flexible markers and measures to curb extreme market price volatility. Action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas, in particular. The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake. Under the next CAP, the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, and animal health and welfare. These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors. It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers, but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right?</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake.

      <p sl="pl">Standards of animal welfare should be obligatory and should be improved. I am emphatically in favour of ensuring that livestock have the best living conditions possible. However, the welfare of animals involves costs, and those costs are borne by the farmers, and there is a problem with unfair competition where meat products are imported into Europe from markets and third countries where no standards of animal welfare are maintained at all. This has to change. We should introduce these standards here, but we should also resolutely demand high standards – the same as we have in the Union – from all those who export their meat and livestock products to the European market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Make the decision to stop these excessive imports and stop the negotiations on that dreadful agreement to import 400 000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries, as it would destroy entire regions.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would urge the House to support this extremely important motion before us this morning. It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies, and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not an attempt to cry wolf, but if we do not rectify the problems identified within the motion, we will, as a consequence, face higher food prices and be more reliant on third country imports. Countries like China and the United States are all increasingly aware of the importance of food supply security and, as a result, are continuing to increase the support which they provide to agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Northern Ireland, the beef price is well below the cost of production. As long as the cost of inputs keeps rising, and extra-regulatory requirements continue to increase, then many farmers will exit the industry, resulting in land abandonment, lack of economic activity in rural areas and a reduction in food production across the EU. It is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the current trade talks with the Mercosur bloc are having a destabilising effect within the industry. Coupled with difficult market conditionings and increasing costs, the livestock sector has been burdened with the further uncertainty created by reopening of the talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is carrying on the negotiations and, regardless of the utterances of the Trade Commissioner, producers in Northern Ireland so far believe that the results can only be negative for European farmers and the quality of food being provided to the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that we need to say right from the start that it is consumers who are the main victims of the crisis we are debating today, and not farmers. It is a known fact that in farming, cereal prices affect approximately 80% of the price of animal feed. This, in turn, affects roughly 70% of production costs. It is impossible to increase proportionally the sale price of meat to the producer. Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer, but deal with the processors who always have the option to import. At the same time, processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price. Unfortunately, this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population’s purchasing power is also affecting livestock production.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is another factor to consider. At a time when farmers will find it difficult to provide feed for their animals during winter, a huge number of them will choose to slaughter their animals, which will help prolong the crisis for more years in the future. In order to maintain domestic prices at a reasonable level and ensure animals receive the feed they require, intervention stocks need to be released. I am therefore pleased by the announcement made by Commissioner Cioloş today. I share the view of my fellow Members who stressed the importance of growing new genetically modified organisms to provide cheap feed for animals and reduce the dependency on imports.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, today’s debate is closely linked to the future of the common agricultural policy. We need a strong common agricultural policy which is well financed and well managed, and which can accommodate both structural development and modernisation measures, as well as market and direct support measures.</p>

This situation has a number of causes that are very clearly spelt out in the text of the resolution that we are debating today, the most important of which is high cereal costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to this situation. It is therefore necessary to act immediately using the available mechanisms, and on this issue, I welcome the Commission’s decision to release 2.8 million tonnes of cereals, a measure that is positive but manifestly insufficient. New instruments must be found in the short and medium terms, for combating speculation in particular; in fact, the Commissioner has just said that that is the crux of the problem. Long-term solutions will need to be found in the context of the debate that we are about to begin on the new common agricultural policy. I therefore call on the Commission to take into account the recommendations made in the resolution signed by several political groups, including my own, because action is needed, in fact, and needed very quickly, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, there is no question that the crisis must be resolved. However, this motion proposes solutions which we cannot support. Making the import of GM soya easier will not help to resolve the crisis in the livestock sector. On the contrary, we must begin to redevelop our own source of plant protein in Europe. Around 75% of our plant protein is imported. This is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also do not understand why many people are questioning the compromise which has been negotiated by all the groups and why they want to open the door to GM soya imports. That is not a solution. We also need to discuss what type of livestock farming we want in Europe. Once again, the small farms have been hit hardest by the crisis. On the other hand, industrial-scale livestock farming is developing in Europe which is not livestock friendly and which is not fair in agricultural terms. We ultimately need to do something in this area as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point is that I am very surprised that EUR 450 million from the agriculture budget is being transferred to the ITER nuclear fusion project. I would like Mr Cioloş to explain what we should think about this.</p>

The British livestock sector is struggling with high feed costs at present, and this is not helped by impediments which are placed in our way by the Commission. Top of the list is the individual electronic identification of sheep – a rule which is not applied to many other Member States, and nor is it a requirement for imports of sheepmeat from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The impending ban on battery cages is producing huge distortions in our egg market, as caged eggs from non-compliant Member States can undercut our more expensively produced colony eggs. We have producers in this area running the two systems side-by-side before the deadline to try to recoup some of the GBP 400 million pounds we have spent complying with your rules which, of course, is putting more eggs on the market.</p>

      <p sl="hu">There are many reasons for the crisis in the livestock sector. Those who say that one reason is the unfair competition caused by imports and mention the dangers of the Mercosur negotiations are right. I wish to raise the issue of the surge in grain prices. It was foreseeable that grain prices would rise, and I have said this several times here in the European Parliament too. The European Commission has done nothing to prevent this. One reason for this problem is the reduction in intervention, which was a serious mistake. We must wake up to the fact that global grain trade is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer companies. Incidentally, the same thing is happening in many of the EU Member States. The European Union decided not to keep emergency stocks, a decision which will further increase speculation in the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The fluctuation of grain prices causes losses not only to grain producers but also to livestock breeders and consumers. In addition to this, the costs are also borne by European taxpayers. Remember that the European Union sold the 2004/2005 intervention stocks at an enormous profit. Grain prices were low in the past period. If the European Union had intervened then, a huge profit could now be realised from the sale of grains, which would also help livestock breeders. However, we have no such stocks, and this is not only bad for producers and consumers, but it also means that the European Union is deprived of the opportunity of providing aid to countries afflicted by famine, such as Pakistan.</p>

Secondly, the high grain and animal feed prices point to the emergence of a shortage of protein in the European Union, on which Mr Häusling will draft a report. Thirdly, the fact that the common agricultural policy system is distorted, it over-subsidises grain farmers, and supports neither pig nor poultry farmers or livestock farmers in general, is another factor contributing to the current livestock crisis. Fourthly, livestock keepers are at a disadvantage in the supply chain compared to processors and traders. Fifthly, livestock keepers are forced to make disproportionately large environmental protection investments. This is particularly serious in the new Member States. This, too, should be addressed and remedied.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs García very much for this initiative and I would also like to refer specifically to the situation of livestock farming in mountain areas. In many regions of the European Union, there are agricultural alternatives to livestock farming, but this is generally not the case in mountain regions. If there were to be no grazing stock in the mountains, then many of the agricultural areas there would simply be useless and would be abandoned. This would not only restrict the business opportunities in mountain regions, but would also change the landscape and eventually reduce biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dairy sector plays a special role in this respect, because it creates jobs and generates income in mountain regions and in other areas. This is why I believe that we must focus specifically on three issues in the reform of agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy (CAP) which takes into account livestock farming in mountain regions and provides subsidies to livestock farmers there. Secondly, we need a flexible second pillar of the CAP which makes it possible to provide special support for livestock farms in mountain areas. Thirdly, we need a quality policy which focuses, in particular, on products from mountain regions and which provides options for special labelling, so that added value can be obtained on the market for these products from the livestock sector in mountain areas.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble. Prices on the international market have increased by more than 16% on average since June. Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved. Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy. The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive, and transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat. The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available. These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them. It is, therefore, time to take action and protect our food from financial speculation. I would like to know, then, what the Commission intends to do about this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices?</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue.</p>

Secondly, it needs to adopt specific measures for breeders that use sustainable protection measures.

The current common agricultural policy and the European Union’s trade policies do not ensure a fair income for farmers, particularly small and medium-sized producers, nor do they prevent the effects of the increasing costs of the factors of production and the volatility of agricultural product prices: they worsen them instead. This volatility has causes that are not only, or even mostly, natural: amongst these is speculation on foodstuffs. Any measures that are taken in this area will always be limited in scope if they do not include banning the instruments that make it profitable, specifically derivatives. Safeguarding production, the right to produce, and food sovereignty and security require an end to the subjugation of agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness. It requires effective measures for regulating and intervening in the markets, without which price volatility will get worse and concentration processes will occur, only to be survived by a small number of large producers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is true that we no longer have the intervention stocks we had in the past, but this is because prices are higher now. Market intervention cannot be justified when prices are high.

I can assure you that these additional funds that are going to ITER have not been taken from any CAP mechanisms; this money is still available and has not been used, because there has been no need to use it. Even with this transfer, however, I can assure you that we have the budget we need to be able to apply the requisite measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by saying that the issue of volatility – and the impact that speculation on the market has on volatility – is one that the Commission is addressing more extensively, for derived products and commodities alike. I am working with my colleague, Mr Barnier, on this issue. The Commission will present some proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the distribution of added value along the food chain, together with Commissioner Tajani, we will organise a first meeting of the High Level Group on this issue no later than next week.</p>

      <p sl="lv">These days, Europe’s livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue for farmers. In the last few months, there has been a significant increase in cereal prices, made more acute by extraordinary events, such as the floods in Pakistan and the forest fires in Russia, for example. Of course, we have no influence over these climatic disasters, but it is within our power to draw up legislative proposals that could help Europe’s farmers to overcome the consequences of these cataclysms. What is certain is that we can and must restrict speculation in cereals, which is also one of the causes of these difficulties. It is intolerable that such dishonest dealings cause losses for a sector that is one of the foundation stones of European agriculture. I should additionally like to remind you that it is essential for the Commission to defend the interests of European farmers in its discussions with the Mercosur nations on a new trade agreement and to ensure the conditions for fair competition. I call upon the Commission to begin working actively to help European farmers to overcome the existing difficulties in the livestock sector, as our support is vital for farmers.</p>

      <p sl="de">The livestock sector presents a number of problems for European farmers, including the rising cost of inputs, competition from third country imports, major fluctuations in feed costs and relatively low prices for meat. If we are to put in place a lasting policy for the livestock sector, we must take into consideration all the stakeholders, including farmers, consumers and the animals themselves. The objective must be to move away from industrial-scale livestock farming and towards more natural, respectful treatment of animals on small farms. All of this must be combined with the highest possible levels of safety for consumers in the form of comprehensive animal health services and clear labelling of all food products from animals, in particular, with regard to their origin and the way in which the animals are reared. The EU must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain economically viable, despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The increase in cereal prices is also a threat to the livestock sector in the EU on account of its dependence on feed imported from third countries. The situation is critical in the area of pork production, where feed accounts for 60% of production costs, but rising costs may gradually threaten all branches of livestock production in the EU. Europe should therefore reduce its dependence on the import of feed from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is surely no solution to switch to genetically modified feeds imported from the US. In the EU, it takes almost two and a half years to approve such feeds, in Argentina around three years, in Brazil three to five years, and China is also adopting strict measures in this area. In the US, on the other hand, approval takes only 15 months. The crisis in the EU livestock sector must not be exploited for the commercial ends of US companies, which see significant export potential in the European market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Union should aim to reduce production costs, to ensure that third countries comply with EU standards, and to ensure that producers get a decent price for their products. It is not acceptable for consumers to bear the consequences of higher prices, for producers to receive ever less money and for distributors to make ever greater profits.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I do not agree with the Commission’s view that no urgent measures are required, because we are facing a structural crisis which needs solving, and not only from the perspective of food security.</p>

      <p sl="ro">European livestock farmers have been facing ever-growing difficulties recently. They are finding it difficult to cope with competition from third countries as the latter do not comply with the high standards which local producers comply with, and they are always victims of the European Union’s commercial negotiations. However, we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the European Commission in future because it is not normal for European farmers to always lose out as a result of commercial agreements. The Commission also needs to be more involved in strengthening producer organisations in all livestock sectors, in order to enable them to negotiate better prices for their products, while taking into account production costs. At the same time, I call on the Commission to release as quickly as possible cereals from the intervention stocks to support this sector which has been hit hard by the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, alternative investment funds are of very great significance to the Union’s economy. The managers of these funds have to keep to legislation and standards which enable the provision of services in the territory of Member States, and supervision of financial markets has to be accurate and effective. To this end, we must eliminate every lack of precision in the legal and administrative systems responsible for these funds. The proposals which have been submitted improve the transparency and efficiency of systems of supervision, and the greater effectiveness of legislation will bear fruit in an improvement in the stability and credibility of financial institutions, and, as a result, an improvement in the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, today’s vote represents a significant step forward by the European Union in the regulation of alternative investment funds. Under the directive, fund managers must be registered and authorised and respect stringent codes of conduct within the European Union. This is, in fact, the first time that this sector has been regulated, and I believe that the paper we have voted on has paved the way to achieving – soon, I hope – a true single market in financial products.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to emphasise the important role of the European Parliament, which has insisted on strong rules for greater monitoring of the financial industry, which will therefore also become – I hope you do not mind my saying it – more ethical. The lessons of the recent past, of the financial crisis triggered by excessive speculation by investment funds, should lead us to welcome this directive, which offers greater guarantees of protection to the public.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when we looked at the initial proposal right at the beginning, 18 months ago, we saw what many would describe as a ‘wrinkly shirt’. This was clearly a proposal on which the industry had not been consulted – a proposal which would have shut markets, made it very difficult for European investors to invest in non-EU funds and led to a lower return for pension funds, affecting investment in developing countries. I was very concerned about those proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fortunately, after the work between the shadow rapporteurs and excellent cooperation, as well as the good work by the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency, we came to an acceptable solution that now works and which keeps markets open, increases transparency and ensures that European investors can continue to invest in markets outside the EU. We have to keep a watchful eye on the role of ESMA to make sure it does not block access to non-EU funds, but overall, we have come up with a compromise that is acceptable across the House.</p>

However, as far as I am aware, none of the EU Member States has recognised Taiwan. Nevertheless, I am not opposed to the visa liberalisation and I think it is a good thing that Taiwanese people can visit the EU without needing a visa. However, what is happening about Europe’s newest state, Kosovo? A total of 22 EU Member States have recognised Kosovo and only five have not done so, but the discussion on visas with Kosovo has not even started. The Commission has still not got under way with this.

The agreement, which ultimately released SEK 1.4 billion for the programme, represents a step towards a Europe that, with our combined efforts, will contribute to making it simpler and cheaper to be environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The launching of energy efficiency projects will create new jobs, make the economy greener and also enable us to be less dependent on oil-producing countries, which is particularly important in these times of crisis. This is exactly how the EU should work. Money that is not used can be allocated to other beneficial projects by means of this type of revolving fund. It took time for the Council to realise this, however. The negotiations were very difficult and the Member States did everything they could to try and wriggle out of their earlier promises. Today, I am pleased that we MEPs did not give in.</p>

Of course, hence the lengthy dole queues snaking across Norway, or the food riots in Switzerland. But he went on to say something else: he said that the dangerous thing about eurosceptism today is that modern patriotism is based on a denigration of other countries, and here he could not be more wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">A true patriot cheers the freedom of all peoples and values the patriotism of other countries. When Mr Van Rompuy went on to make his second point, which is that eurosceptism equals nationalism equals war, he would perhaps have been well advised to look at the aims of the allied powers in the two wars whose end we commemorate today. They were fighting for the freedom of all nations, for the restoration of sovereignty of all European countries. It was thanks to their patriotism that Europe was not united in tyranny, that sovereignty and independence were restored and, indeed, that the European Union became possible.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the demographic changes which have taken place in the European Union over the last few decades have drawn attention to the necessity of reforming the system of social and retirement care and developing an effective migration policy. Encouraging people to take early retirement has become a common practice, and this has caused a fall in professional activity among people between the ages of 55 and 64. At the same time, a very serious problem is the unemployment rate among young people, which is higher than in any other age group. In relation to this, we should strive both to include and to retain in the labour market a workforce comprising different age groups.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I fully support the Mann report. Indeed, I believe that solidarity between the generations is just as important as solidarity between Member States. I want to highlight three particular issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully agree with paragraph 24, which speaks about an end to a compulsory retirement age so that people can choose when they want to finish working, but, at the same time, seeks to maintain a pensionable age, so that people who want to retire can do so and receive their benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was particularly pleased to see that a number of my amendments on carers and family carers were taken into consideration, in particular, paragraph 125, which speaks about family carers, including the right for them to choose whether they wish to care or not, and also the ability to combine caring with paid work, and to ensure that they have full access to social security schemes and old age pensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am, however, equally supportive of the European Youth Guarantee initiative, which proposes that any young people who have been unemployed for four months or longer will be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training, etc., all of this to support their reintegration, or integration, into the workplace. As I said at the beginning, solidarity between the generations is crucial, especially in the current economic situation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this document by Thomas Mann because it reflects the problems of intergenerational interaction. Usually, we talk of the European Union’s demographic problems from the point of view of young people. This document attempts to combine the specific characteristics of all the generations and related problems in health, education, labour and similar sectors, seeking balanced solutions to those problems.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As far as the older generation is concerned, we should be grateful for its contribution to the development of the European Union, both economically and culturally. We must ensure that these people can grow old with dignity. However, due to ageing Europe, it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this. We must therefore not only create conditions for the improvement of family policy, but bring up a young generation which would be able to create added value, i.e. through the education system and non-formal education. Of course, we must make efforts as regards the integration of young people into the labour market. So thank you for this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, demographers tell us that in order to sustain itself, a population needs a birth rate of 2.1 live births per woman. In the whole of Europe, the only country that is reproducing at sustainability level is Albania, or Turkey if you count Turkey as a European country – and nowhere else. According to one UN report, Europe, including European Russia, is scheduled to lose 100 million people over the next 40 years. Germany alone is going to see a shrinkage of its population by 20 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are not projections about what might happen if we do not do something, as there is nothing we can do about it now since the decline in birth rates has already happened. The only question is how we deal with it. How did we get to this stage? What brought us to this pass? One does not want to oversimplify, as there are obviously a lot of things going on, to do with changing working patterns, the spread of contraception, the different role of women in society, and longevity.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I wonder whether one part of the problem is the way in which the state has expanded and squeezed out the private sphere, has annexed to itself jobs and duties that were traditionally discharged within a family – childcare, education and social security. The first generation raised with cradle to grave welfare or, in other words, to be excused the traditional responsibilities of adulthood, has also been the first to give up on parenthood.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now face a choice between demographic collapse or importing 100 million people to sustain our numbers and pay our pensions. This should be the top issue in Europe and it is not one we can address by arguing about changes in employment regulation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the Commission’s proposal that our research framework programmes should go through a simplifying process. Over time, these programmes expanded due to good tender opportunities but, at the same time, the uncertainties related to administration and control increased. We need a new scheme that has greater confidence in tenderers and which, in addition to strengthening scientific and technical evaluation processes, also takes into account the simplification of financial and administrative processes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Naturally, there is a degree of risk in any financial transaction, but the exaggerated administrative control of such risks also increases the total costs of the whole process. We must strive to ensure that our research is attractive and accessible for the world’s best researchers, European enterprises and universities. This also requires the harmonisation of rules and procedures as soon as possible, which should be done even during the Seventh Framework Programme, but certainly during the preparation of the eighth. For this reason, I, too, voted in favour of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the foundation of Europe’s economic development is investment in education as a form of investment in human capital and innovations which contribute to the creation of modern methods and technologies. To invest in innovation, it is necessary to concentrate on subsidising research. An example, here, are the framework programmes we have debated, which are the largest international research programmes in the world. By subsidising this kind of research, Europe has the opportunity to improve competitiveness in the global arena, create jobs for thousands of people and improve the quality of life of all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to maintain the highest standards in the framework programmes, the rapporteur has endorsed the maximum possible reductions in bureaucracy and simplification of administrative procedures. As a result, this would allow easier access to funding for this research in the European Union, and this, after all, is what we want. Needless to say, I endorsed the report.</p>

I am convinced that with today’s vote, we have made a considerable contribution to achieving this essential aim, particularly for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which constitutes the backbone of the economy of every Member State. In fact, despite the high quality of their output, such businesses often do not succeed in gaining easy access to the resources that are necessary for boosting their production standards even higher.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also useful to point out, as the rapporteur did, that the voting was extremely timely because it followed immediately from the intermediate evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme and the preparation of the eighth. I thank the rapporteur for her work.</p>

Unfortunately, I should point out that I missed the broader discussions during the plenary session, but the document itself is really important, and I welcome its adoption.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is important to establish a level playing field for scientists from all EU Member States, to provide equal payment for research activities, without dividing scientists according to their country’s standard of living, because scientific progress is a matter for the whole of the European Union, not just individual countries. At present, the prevailing attitude is that work by scientists from the new Member States is less valuable than that done by scientists from the old Member States. Such a discriminatory practice is wrong and unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is also important to ensure equal conditions for all research institutions, and not to divide them according to their size and financial capacity. This is particularly important for research institutions in the new EU Member States. It is not the size of organisations but scientific progress that creates value. Therefore, it is important to provide opportunities, not just for universities, but for non-profit research institutes and other scientific organisations, to submit applications and participate in research programmes. Therefore, I congratulate all scholars, and together with improved research mechanisms, we will move forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very pleased to see that we carried the amendment which asks the Commission to deal immediately with the issue of adventitious presence of GMOs in imported feeds.

      <p sl="en">We also heard about the high cost of compliance with EU regulations, so that we do not have a level playing field for third country imports. But perhaps one of the most crucial issues is the whole area of the food chain. Yesterday, the Court of Auditors issued a report on the sugar sector and one of their recommendations was that price formation be subject to regular monitoring by the Commission and that the Commission and the Member States ensure that competition law is correctly enforced in the sector, thus ensuring the treaty objective that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution because for years in Europe, we have seen frequent crises affecting the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">The causes are many, including a reduction in demand for mutton, lamb and goatmeat, partly due to the large-scale import of meat from third countries. The livestock sector has also been struck by indirect causes, however. I am referring to problems in the milk and dairy sector and the problem of cereal price volatility, which has seen severe speculation.</p>
      <p sl="it">With a view to CAP reform after 2013, it will be necessary to tackle the matter with commitment and come up with measures necessary for limiting the impact of price volatility in the agricultural sector once and for all.

      <p sl="ga">However, I want to say a couple of things. Firstly, the Court of Auditors report yesterday was a damning indictment of the Commission, showing that after EUR 1.2 billion in compensation, the closure of many factories and the loss of thousands of jobs, we are now only 85% self-sufficient in sugar supply.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, during the week, I attended an agriculture seminar here and the same situation applied to fish coming into the European Union, particularly from Vietnam, some of which could even be polluted.

It then took the Irish Government six months to apply for the EGF, and seven more to answer to the Commission’s request for clarifications. The slow and ineffective handling of the Dell application risks a return of much of the allocation to Brussels, and this lesson was disregarded. The Irish Government must act more swiftly to ensure that this aid is granted directly to those who need it, that it is not used to replace government funding, and that the training and re-skilling programmes offered are suited to the workers’ needs. Astonishingly, the government is only now preparing to establish a coordinator for the fund, four years after its inception.</p>

Such regulation plays a crucial role, because it replaces regulation at national level with regulation at European level, and provides for conditions for taking into account the specificities of the various funds covered, on the basis of their systemic risk. The establishment of rules of conduct for all financial services is being considered at a time of crisis, as is promoting a truly single market by making a framework of common European rules possible. The rules proposed by this directive provide greater transparency on the management of the funds themselves, as well as on how they are marketed within the European Union – by means of a simple authorisation in various Member States – and in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The financial crisis that has hit the European Union hard has its roots in the ‘unbridled’ activity of numerous investment funds, particularly those from the United States. Amongst these funds, the alternative funds, or hedge funds, are characterised by aggressive speculation. This appears to be one of the major causes of the disaster, the consequences of which we are suffering today. In order to protect the future of the European market from the excesses of these alternative funds, I voted for the report by my colleague, Mr Gauzès. This text represents a major step forward in financial regulation. With this vote, we reinforce the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This European authority for financial markets will be set up on 1 January 2011 and will deliver, under strict conditions, a ‘passport’ permitting the activity of managers of alternative funds located in the European Union. The directive requires them to be authorised or registered, to respect operational and organisational requirements, and observe rules of conduct and transparency. It will subject them to the supervisory powers and ability to apply sanctions of the competent authorities of the Member States and of ESMA. At a later date, managers of funds located outside the European Union will be subjected to the same rules as those applying to European funds.</p>

It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step.

The report also fails to clearly separate those who work with this type of funds and those who work in traditional banking activities, or to block the actions of speculative funds located in tax havens. Instead, by setting ‘thresholds’ on the value of ‘systemically relevant’ assets, it is clearing the way for formal fragmentation processes that will remove large numbers of the investment companies that are meant to be covered by the directive from its scope.

Regulation restricting the activities of businesses should be a solution only when the error in question cannot be corrected – for example, where human health or life is at stake. Let us therefore be careful when we regulate. The role of public institutions is not to deprive people of responsibility for their decisions, but to ensure they have the information they need when making decisions. Let us not forget that natural support for research and education comes from private sources, or investment funds, which lend money to promising entrepreneurial projects and invest in the development of new technologies, all with an awareness and a weighing up of the possible risks. If our quest for security reduces the appetite of investors to look for new opportunities in the EU, we shall always remain dependent on inefficient and bureaucratic public investment programmes.

Taiwan conducts a significant volume of trade with the EU and its economy is number 25 in the world, continuing to grow by more than 13% annually. This sustained development reduces the chances of the EU facing an influx of illegal migrants from Taiwan. This is why I believe that facilitating the movement of persons must become one of the key features of bilateral cooperation. The decision to waive the compulsory visa requirement for Taiwanese nationals also takes into account their fulfilment of the technical conditions on travel document security. The introduction of biometric passports in 2008 is one of the constructive measures implemented so far. I hope that the European Parliament’s decision will be approved by the Council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year.

The decision as to whether or not visa requirements should apply to third countries is taken on a case-by-case basis. The aim of the proposal is to abolish visa requirements for citizens of Taiwan. The European Parliament supported the aim of this proposal. It is very important to establish a common immigration policy, while developing trade and economic relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Economically, Taiwan has seen significant growth in recent years, and its income per head of population is currently the highest in the world. Taiwan is also an excellent partner cooperating in the fields of science, investment, new technology, education, culture and tourism. Therefore, lifting the visa requirement for Taiwan will enhance trade and economic relations with the EU.</p>

Since the 1950s, Taiwan has gone through many successful reforms. In political terms, Taiwan has completed a process of far-reaching democratisation. The changes of the 1980s led to the first democratic elections being held there in 1996. The EU and Taiwan maintain economic and commercial relations on a large scale. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Taiwan. Taiwan is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner in Asia. There is also cooperation on research and education, culture and the environment. The numbers of illegal immigrants to the EU from Taiwan are very low. The citizens of most EU Member States, with the exception of Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. The citizens of these three Member States are also to be included in visa-free travel arrangements in the very near future.

These projects are most effective when implemented at municipal, regional and local level, but in duly justified cases, it may be more effective to aim at national level. As the current financial and economic crisis and the resulting lower budgetary income are having a particularly adverse effect on the finances of local and regional authorities, it should be ensured that the difficult budgetary situation of those authorities does not hinder them from being able to access the funding. I am happy that a short-term economic impact is required, and that the time between receipt of an application for a project and the financial decision should not exceed six months. As we know, the EU’s dependence on countries supplying oil and gas is increasing. In some countries, projects for the renovation of buildings, gas and electricity infrastructure projects, inter-connectors, wind farms, and Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS) are taking a long time to move forward. Unspent funds from these projects may be allocated to this field. The report is particularly relevant for Lithuania, which is becoming increasingly dependent on energy from Russia.

I also agree with the rule that the instrument should be limited to financing measures that have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the Union, increased energy security and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing structural crisis is, paradoxically, an important opportunity for putting this back on the table. The difficulties that the major economic systems have experienced may allow Europe to recover. That, however, will require the vision, capacity and courage of a new strategy. In the current situation, the only strategy that retains some prospect of success is investing in innovative solutions in order to break with the current technological and scientific paradigms.</p>

Funds will be targeted at supporting local and regional authorities in projects that should prove economically and financially efficient, so as to ensure a return on the investment in good time. A total of EUR 146.34 million should be made available from January 2011 to 31 March 2014. Contributions received may take the form of loans, guarantees, equities or other financial products.

Joint action is needed on the great challenges faced by the world – the struggle against climate change, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the Middle East peace process, the specific situations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and even the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The desire to achieve well-being for our peoples by democratic means – through the free market, more humane working conditions, social systems that work and all the other achievements that make our countries what they are today – counts for much more than a dominant position in an international league table that can provide raw data but not convey emotions or reflect quality of life.

The US and the EU are seeking to ‘coordinate’ strategies, using a panoply of economic, diplomatic and military means to reverse this development. The majority in this House are not deviating from their choice of neoliberalism; instead, they are intensifying it, hoping that new steps will emerge from this summit towards greater ‘economic integration’ and the establishment of the ‘transatlantic market’.

In my opinion, the Commission must ensure that any agreement or measure on the transfer of personal data must also stand the legal proportionality test and protect the confidentiality of personal data. As an institution representing citizens, in this process, the European Parliament must be informed by the Commission of all issues relating to the transfer of personal data, so that it might express its position on planned agreements.

All these issues have taken on worrying proportions since 11 September 2001 and remain current. Terrorism and other forms of organised crime are fought today with rapid and effective information exchanges between security agencies, rather than by conventional police forces. Without these exchanges, we would be exposed to concerted, cross-border criminal activity, with no chance of responding appropriately.

While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage, checks on freight are often left to the shipping companies themselves. If this is to change in future, it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved. In the case of passenger security checks, this balance has already been lost and, therefore, as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides, the regulations will once again be relaxed. Just as questionable is the issue of whether the FBI needs to know the name, address, e-mail address, credit card number and number of suitcases of people travelling to the USA and whether it should be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years. The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases.

We will have to monitor closely how the first pilot programme in this area progresses because it deals with a theme which is of concern to the whole of Europe: the impact of an ageing population and extending working life. I voted to adopt this resolution, while also taking into account the further themes which will be dealt with after the pilot project has been assessed. These are themes of general interest.</p>

The result will be to allow blockages caused by financing problems, fragmented research systems and markets, inadequate support for innovation in public contracts and slow standardisation to be managed more effectively.

Parliament therefore welcomes the first proposed topic for European Innovation Partnership, on active and healthy ageing, and the suggested approach by the Commission to first run a pilot project testing the most suitable format for these partnerships before launching any further ones, and calls on the Commission, when running the first pilot project on active and healthy ageing, to include social innovation which leads to a better quality of life, prevents disease, improves social networks within public sectors and among social partners, and promotes the introduction of new technologies supporting the quality of life.</p>

Innovative use of resources may prove to be one of the best methods for eliminating disparities between states or regions. It will also contribute to preserving the diversity of these areas by using good practices and the experience of other parties. The development of new types of production or services and the innovative use of resources will contribute to the rational and effective development of local, regional and national markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation is human creativity. By looking for innovative solutions, we contribute to an increase in the well-being of society. At a time when the economy, technology and information science are undergoing dynamic development, we must not forget the most significant factor – human capital. Innovation is not just new production methods or new uses, for example, of local products. In addition to this, and above all else, it is human capital. Finding new ways of involving society in development processes in many areas of life is an essential condition for success. Cooperation at a variety of social levels is slowly becoming an essential requirement, especially in the field of research and education. Innovation partnerships are the next step – and also a very obvious one – in a developing Europe.</p>

The aim of the ‘Innovation Union’ flagship initiative envisioned by the EU 2020 strategy is to launch innovation partnerships to streamline research, development and the arrival of inventions on the market, starting with the area of healthy ageing as a pilot project. It seems relevant to me for other areas to be covered, such as young people, researchers, and small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also desirable for work to be better carried out in partnerships, as we have unique potential in terms of values, creativity and diversity. I therefore call for more and better investment in education, research and development: these priorities must not only be protected from budget cuts, but must even have their budgets increased.</p>

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic, Eurasian security architecture with a comprehensive concept of security, including political and military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions. However, in spite of its importance, the OSCE is the sole organisation among those dealing with security issues that lacks an international legal personality and consequently, there are many political and practical legal implications. This organisation has an essential role to play on a number of issues, including non-proliferation, disarmament, economic cooperation, and protection and promotion of human rights. However, the lack of a legal personality and problems with the decision-making mechanism weaken this organisation, because it is not always able to respond to crises appropriately or in a timely manner. I agree with the proposals expressed in the resolution on the necessity to continue the dialogue on the legal framework of the OSCE, and the call on Lithuania, which will hold the OSCE Chairmanship in 2011, to ensure continuity and progress in the process of strengthening the OSCE.</p>

The principles of peace and freedom that were proclaimed in the Treaty of Rome and the others that followed it must continue to underlie any decisions that are to be made. So far, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has shown that the way in which it performs its duties is absolutely compatible with these principles, and therefore greater involvement by the EU’s institutions in this organisation would be desirable.

The effectiveness of the actions taken against security threats and challenges depends on the proper coordination and operation of these three strands.

      <p sl="de">For some years, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was founded during the cold war as an institution for monitoring and confidence building purposes, has been undergoing an identity crisis. According to critics, the organisation is not equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century, such as the global financial crisis and environmental issues, including climate change. In theory, the three main players in the OSCE are the USA, Russia and the EU. Even though the situation has improved slightly under the influence of the new president, American foreign policy has very little interest in multilateral organisations. Russia appears to have equally little interest and sees the expansion of the EU and NATO as an intrusion in its historic sphere of influence. As a result, it is understandable that Moscow is calling for the OSCE to take a new direction and to shift its focus from human rights and the process of democratisation to establishing a European security structure. Russia is essential to the EU, not only because of its supply of energy, but also as a strategic partner. If the EU wants to change its role in the OSCE, it must become a counterpole to the USA, rather than a powerless paymaster. Ultimately, a sensitive approach will be needed not only in relation to Russia, but in relation to all the Eurasian states which are represented in the OSCE but who are not members of the EU.

The Member States themselves must reach a decision on the implementation of early retirement provisions, taking into account their country’s situation and practice. Once again, I would like to draw attention to the fact that both demographic changes and age discrimination are undermining intergenerational solidarity and economic growth. Such discrimination severely constrains access to the labour market for both older and younger workers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In recent years, EU Member States, faced with a dramatic decline in the birth rate, have had to cope with an increasingly ageing population. The rise in life expectancy is a positive development, keeping people physically and mentally active for longer. In these circumstances, it is becoming clear that we need to face the prospect of the situation becoming even more serious, resulting in a demographic imbalance which will have its impact on Member States’ economies and budget resources, a development which has repercussions as well for the EU as a whole. Therefore, we are facing the possibility of future generations bearing the financial burden for these demographic changes. This situation makes the Lisbon objective of having half the population aged between 55 and 64 in employment absolutely essential, even if it has been missed this year. To counter this phenomenon, swift and decisive measures must be taken, in a lifecycle-orientated approach, to bring young and older people into the labour market. The proportion of people out of work in the 15-24 age group is considerably higher than that for any other age group in the EU. Therefore, the proposal for the European Youth Guarantee initiative should be recommended.</p>

I voted in favour because I believe that establishing a fair balance between generations is the only way for the younger generation to be given real assurances and to increase their participation in the labour market. I also believe the time has come for the European Union and the Member States to examine the new questions posed by the generational challenge. Europe will soon, in fact, be facing real problems due to its low demographic growth, and suitable policies need to be adopted straight away so as not to jeopardise the entire European social security system. In this respect, I think it is essential to re-evaluate social policy in favour of the over-sixties. People in this age group bring added value to the world of work, and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more. I therefore agree with the proposal to review the social security system so as to allow the over-sixties to keep their jobs after they have reached retirement age.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur’s view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but, on the contrary, a great benefit because of their experience of life and their knowledge.

Although the main instruments for promoting justice between generations fall under the jurisdiction of the Member States, the EU plays a crucial role in terms of surveillance, monitoring the correct and effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination legislation, and in terms of promoting the exchange of best practices and action plans. It is essential for the EU and the Member States to promote new initiatives for active, healthy and dignified ageing.

Overall, therefore, I am voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report. There must be a shift in paradigm with regard to how societies and economies view the ageing of the population. Instead of seeing them as a burden and synonymous with increased costs, their experience and knowledge mean that older people should be seen as a valuable asset in business culture. To this end, businesses should be encouraged to develop age-management strategies, which would increase their competitiveness by making use of the experience and specific qualities of their older workers. I also believe that the ageing of the population provides an important opportunity to improve competitiveness and encourage potential innovation, thereby promoting growth and creating jobs.

Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced.

Insufficient welfare provisions, inadequate social services and high levels of youth unemployment contribute to late marriage and childbirth, thus accelerating the ageing of our populations. Both the young and the elderly experience different forms of age discrimination, particularly as regards access to the labour market and certain social services. While Member States control key instruments such as national budgets, pension and healthcare services, the EU can further the reach of anti-discrimination legislation, particularly to protect older women in the labour market. Moreover, women of all ages often care for young and elderly dependents. Their work is, in itself, an example of intergenerational support and needs socio-economic recognition, although not as a substitute to the development of quality care services. As atypical and precarious forms of work become increasingly common, the right to a decent pension at the age of retirement is threatened. This trend can only be countered by economic policies focused on growth, respect for workers’ rights and the provision of quality public services.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As I have said previously, European society is ageing, which is often seen as a negative in economic analysis. Naturally, the inversion of the demographic pyramid in countries where the welfare state is still strong means that there are ever fewer people contributing to the social assistance system and ever more people dependent on it. In very blunt terms, more older people means increased spending on pensions and health. However, a society of solidarity cannot look at ageing in this way. It is essential to create active ageing solutions and ways to make use of the immense human potential of older people, who, even in a competitive market like Europe’s, still represent an added value because of their greater experience and knowledge. At the other end of the scale, we cannot talk about an ageing population without talking about birth policies that encourage the birth of children in the European Union. The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children, one of the lowest in the world; this can only be reversed with robust policies in support of families, which do not penalise men and women who decide to have children, in economic, tax and professional terms.</p>

Even Mrs Tribalat, a French demographer that could hardly be accused of being sympathetic to the National Front, has come to the same conclusion. I am well aware that in this House, we like to believe that, according to the SOS Racisme slogan, ‘Mohamed will pay for Maurice’s pension’ … as well as that of Karl, Matthew and Juan.

In this context, the work of the European institutions should contain and provide support for this inequality, which causes a lack of social cohesion. This common ideal would result in greater social cohesion, less economic inequality and a balanced individual and collective development of society. Development and social cohesion must not be enemies of progress but an integral part of it for more robust integration and coexistence in society.

      <p sl="it">On the one hand, demographic change means that people fortunately have longer life expectancies and remain physically and mentally active for longer. On the other, birth rates in the Member States have remained at low levels for decades, and the older generations account for an ever increasing proportion of the population. The limits of the intergenerational contract have been reached. Active ageing means a process of maximising the potential for people to stay healthy, participate in the life of their communities and improve their quality of life as they grow older. I am firmly convinced that 2012 should be declared the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, with a view to highlighting the contribution that young and older people make to society. That is why I have done my best here to give all the support needed for Europe to overcome this challenge.</p>

I voted in favour of adopting strong measures from Member States to counter the grey or black economy maintained by an ‘undeclared’ workforce, the victims of which are women in most cases, which is more than adversely affecting the EU labour market, rather than just promoting measures aiming to protect their own workers. At the same time, undeclared work must be combated using concrete measures and sanctions against employers and/or intermediaries. I also voted for Member States and the Commission to cooperate as well on the supervision of care services, as part of which Member States could consider setting up a network of national care contact points which could be used both at national and European level to obtain information about the care services provided and their quality, as well as to lodge complaints about the quality of these services.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between the generations, because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament. I am very much opposed to the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous, both in terms of contributions and benefits, than comparable private sector pensions. In addition, private sector pension funds should not play a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions. The pay-as-you-go system must not, under any circumstances, be replaced by capital-funded systems. In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system. However, I have voted against the passage in the resolution which calls on the Member States ‘to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)’.

Older people’s employability also depends on autonomy and individual choice for workers and a better work-life balance.

It highlights the need for intergenerational solidarity and puts forward some pertinent suggestions, namely, an initiative regarding a European 50-plus pact which includes combating age discrimination, the objective of full employment up to the legal retirement age and helping to reintegrate older disabled people. The reason why I abstained from the final vote when this report was more than satisfactory is because paragraph 24, which wants to scrap compulsory retirement ages, has been maintained. The fact is, if we have no safeguards enabling our senior citizens to take their retirement, we can no longer guarantee them a good end to their life.

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, the report duly notes that steadily decreasing populations in the European Union and the continuing tendency of low birth rates are creating numerous challenges for Europe’s economy and society. For these reasons, the EU labour market will experience mostly negative structural changes. In Lithuania, these demographic problems are further compounded by the mass exodus of Lithuania’s young people to work abroad. We are a small nation and we are rapidly losing our most active 25-40 year olds, in whose upbringing and education much was invested. Lithuania needs these young people’s talents, experience and diligence to overcome the demographic challenges mentioned. I therefore support the European Youth Guarantee initiative proposed by the rapporteur, according to which all young people in the EU would be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training following a period of six months’ unemployment. More should also be done to increase birth rates: accessible high quality childcare, education and mentoring for young children is the first step in the right direction. We must also stop the social exclusion of elderly people. We must persuade our economy and society that the elderly are not a burden. Their experience, achievements and wealth of knowledge can be useful for all generations.</p>

I would like briefly to add another aspect to the discussion. As a Member of the European Parliament from Saxony, a region which is hard hit by demographic change, and as a Member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and rapporteur of the own-initiative report on future innovation policy in the EU, I would like to say that at EU level and, above all, in the Member States, we must, of course, continue to combat demographic change and make the regions more attractive for young people, in particular, by increasing economic growth, creating jobs and developing a tailor-made education policy. However, I would also like to emphasise the special importance of older workers in SMEs with regard to innovation. The EU has finally recognised that, in particular in SMEs, it is not only new technological inventions which are innovative, but also, for example, the ability to adapt a product to meet a customer’s specific circumstances or improve service processes. Particularly in this area, it is older employees who have a wealth of experience and can make a company innovative. For this reason, we must combat age discrimination in the workplace. The EU and the Member States must take this into consideration in all their social and labour legislation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Let us not become confused over terminology – the report we have adopted is more about finding new labour resources than about solidarity. The demographic crisis is not something we found out about yesterday. Some of us have been drawing attention to it for a very long time. For years, we have been saying that Europe is ageing and dying. Now it is upon us and we are frantically looking for a solution. Cold logic offers us many. Putting back the retirement age, increasing the birth rate, bringing more women into the sphere of formal employment, and increasing the influx of immigrants and integrating them into our society. We are willing to do all of these, and the submitted report talks about all of these. However, I am not entirely sure it will help – and if so, for how long. This is because we are addressing not the cause, but the consequences. We are behaving like participants in a pyramid scheme, who see that the base of the pyramid is starting to stagnate. We are looking for new players to expand the base. However, by deliberately giving a new meaning to words like ‘solidarity’ or ‘work-life balance’, we are destroying genuine solidarity and taking children away from their parents.

For some time, the research community has expressed concern that the implementation of research programmes and the development of innovations is not proceeding as swiftly as hoped because of particularly complex bureaucratic requirements. This is a particular problem for smaller organisations, such as SMEs, high tech start ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres. There is a real demand for improvement and streamlining of research funding and administration. At present, there are different rules and procedures for different instruments of the framework programme, and this severely impedes stakeholders’ opportunities to submit applications.

It is therefore time for Europe to invest more in these areas: to compete on the world stage, the European Union must develop innovative products and modern services.

I endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur of basing the funding system not on results, which may lower the scientific ambition of researchers, but on scientific criteria and, hence, on excellence.

      <p sl="pt">Research and development are crucially important to achieving the goals to which the European Union has committed itself under the Europe 2020 strategy. European programmes in the field of research and innovation have been increasing significantly in recent years, both in terms of applications made to them and in terms of their budgetary allocation. However, it is difficult for small and medium-sized organisations to handle the complexity and bureaucracy inherent to these programmes. Accessing the programmes and preparing proposals are still very difficult, especially for those new to them; the administrative burdens for administering projects and accounting are considered too high; and the average time between the awarding of the subsidy and payment remains too long. The mechanisms involved in the research framework programmes therefore urgently need to be updated and simplified, in order to simplify the monitoring of the projects’ financial and administrative aspects while reinforcing the process of scientific and technological evaluation I welcome the European Commission’s initiative to reverse this status quo, and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Carvalho, on the excellent work she has done in proposing concrete measures to improve the current system.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is essential to simplify access to the framework research programmes in order for there to be motivation for potential interested parties to access them and for important funds not to be squandered. We cannot forget that research makes a vital contribution to economic growth, to job creation, and to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy. It is therefore time to coordinate national, regional and European research policies, so that there are not considerable obstacles to obtaining cost-effective solutions. That being the case, we need to move towards greater simplification and harmonisation of rules and procedures, as simplification is not just an isolated objective, but is rather a means of ensuring the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There is increasing despondency among researchers, research institutes, universities and businesses with the research framework programmes due to the complex nature of the European Commission’s tendering procedure. However, the 2020 strategy aims to improve the framework conditions and access to funding for research and innovation to ensure that innovative ideas can be turned into goods and services creating growth and jobs. Therefore, in the interests of efficiency and with a view to promoting the highest quality research, it was highly desirable to simplify the implementation of the research framework programmes. We had to take these measures to remain attractive in order to attract and keep the best scientists in Europe and remain competitive in a global economy.

      <p sl="lv">I agree that we must simplify the funding of these programmes, but on one condition – after the result has been achieved, it must be available free of charge to all EU countries. Otherwise, what will happen is this – one EU nation will carry out the research project with EU Structural Fund money, with common EU resources, therefore, but then, after it has obtained the result – be it a new product or new technology, it will sell it to other EU Member States. This is unacceptable. It is important that all who provide funding should be able to dispose of the results of research projects carried out with common EU funds free of charge.</p>

      <p sl="de">During the economic crisis which developed out of the financial crisis, between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion from the EU budget was redeployed to energy projects from other subsidy funds which still had money available in order to aid the recovery of the economy. As the Commission explained in its presentation of the 2020 energy strategy, an investment of EUR 1 trillion is needed to develop the outdated power grid in Europe over the next few years. It is to be expected that consumers will have to pay the cost of this, rather than the energy sector. An important factor in this respect will be energy research, providing that it focuses on the genuinely more cost-effective technologies. We must bring an end to the emphasis on nuclear power which, in addition to posing the risk of environmental catastrophes, is by no means cost-effective when the cost of expensive terminal storage, a problem which has not yet been resolved, is included. We must devote our attention to green technologies. I have voted in favour of the report.</p>

Our businesses, researchers, scientists and universities all find themselves having to compete on a global level with markets that have enormous amounts of resources available to them, often with very much lower costs than our own. Therefore, we need to invest more in innovation and research and less in largely unskilled manual labour, as our costs will never be competitive with those of the new economic powers. We need to create new, high level positions, promote sustainable mobility, improve education and technical skills and coordinate them with the needs of the labour market. I hope that the next framework programme makes all necessary resources available to ensure that the European Union is a leading light in this sector, that it is always at the cutting edge, and that it is able to attract resources and human capital.

Research and innovation are at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, it is particularly difficult for smaller organisations – SMEs, high-tech start-ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres – to cope with the procedural complexity involved in accessing the funds earmarked for this sector. The scientific community is urgently calling for harmonisation of the rules and procedures and for a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements. Recently, 13 000 researchers put their names to a petition requesting greater simplification and trust in EU research funding.

The report covers the demands of the scientific community in a comprehensive and exemplary manner, along with the conclusions of the seminar on simplification organised by the Spanish Presidency in February. This is why I have voted in favour of a report that consolidates a series of principles and lines of action such as closely linking this matter with the future of the financial perspectives after 2013, the tri-annual review of the Financial Regulation and the application of tolerable risk of error in the area of research, all of which will be fundamental for preparing the Eighth Framework Programme.

Without simplification of the administrative formalities for the tendering and implementation procedure, there will be no growth in participation of the private sector in the framework programmes.

      <p sl="pl">In addition, one of the most commonly occurring problems is the selection of foreign partners for projects. Greater help from the Commission is still essential here. The most important barrier to building an innovative economy is the fact that people do not know of the existence of the Seventh Framework Programme – or that they are afraid of it. The complicated procedures are making many institutions concentrate mainly on obtaining support from structural funds. The current achievements of Polish groups (according to the evaluation of the Polish National Contact Point on the basis of data supplied by the European Commission) are not very satisfactory. The success rate for the participation of Polish groups is 18.56%, while for subsidies granted, it is 13.72%, compared to the EU average of 22.28% and 20.56% respectively. This is a great loss for Polish science, which has at its disposal a huge research potential as well as superb scientific staff. Better use should be made of the opportunity presented by FP7.

      <p sl="it">Today, we are voting on an important document about simplifying procedures for accessing framework programmes for research and innovation. Simplifying and standardising the legislative framework of European research programmes is a choice we have to make. Indeed, science, education and innovation are the foundations for economic revitalisation and the creation of new jobs. We need to invest in research and innovation if we want to focus on new products and services to make Europe more competitive and, at the same time, improve European citizens’ quality of life. Over recent years, the European research and innovation programmes have become notably broader in scope. This has also brought an increase in rules and administrative procedures which, in turn, have caused greater difficulties in participating in European tenders. Through this document, we are urging the European Commission to remove these obstacles and urgently begin simplifying the rules for accessing research funding. I voted in favour of the resolution, hoping for greater procedural uniformity in order to allow easier and more open access to European funding, which often remains largely unused, partly because of procedural difficulties.</p>

Innovation linked to cutting edge science and education is one of the engines of job creation and economic growth. Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services. Therefore, as the rapporteur rightly observes, it is important for us to help simplify the mechanisms involved in the framework programmes for research. The coordination of rules and procedures and the simplification of research funding and administration are long overdue. It is difficult for the majority of smaller organisations (high tech start ups or universities and research centres) to cope with the complexity of the current rules. According to this year’s European Innovation Scoreboard, which compares the innovation performance of all EU Member States, Lithuania’s rates are below the EU-27 average. However, it demonstrated good progress and has great potential – Lithuania has one of the fastest Internet connections and one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the world. Therefore, it is very important to continue to invest in the development of technologies and improve the implementation of national and European digital agendas.

She highlights a number of areas for improvement with regard to simplifying the administrative processes. I was happy to vote in favour of this report. I would like to add one brief point which I often hear about from small and medium-sized companies in the area which I represent, and that is the language issue. Many companies which are entitled to apply for European subsidies and whose ideas will bring added value on a European scale do not have the necessary language skills to go through the application process in English. In the Seventh Framework Programme guidelines, under the heading ‘Tips for a successful application’ the following text appears: ‘Although it is possible to submit an application in any of the official EU languages, applications should always be submitted in English’. This means that a project with an application which is not in English does not have a chance, even if, for example, the common working language of the group of companies in question is not English. In order to reduce the administrative work involved for the companies at which these subsidy programmes are aimed, the EU Commission should change the way in which the project applications are examined by their experts, so that at least during the initial stage, the project documentation can be submitted in one of the Commission’s three working languages.</p>

However, the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services; other activities, including research and entrepreneurial activities, should be financed from private sources. The role of this Parliament should be limited to two areas. The first is the creation of a basic legislative framework to facilitate this type of business. If we are asking in the resolution today for a simplification of the mechanisms and instruments used in the current system of public grants, we are solving the result and not the cause of the problem. This is because public grants are the problem. The second area is respect for the rights of EU Member States. If some states ban the use of human embryos for research purposes, such research should not be financed from the common resources of the EU. It is like taking money from a committed non-smoker and using it to subsidise tobacco cultivation. I am in favour of simplifying support for research.

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because livestock farming is going through an extremely difficult time as a result of increased animal feed prices. We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble. Prices on the international market have already increased by more than 16% on average since June. Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved. Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy. The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive. Transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat. The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available. These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them.</p>

With regard to the primary sector, the transition in many regions from an economy based primarily on arable and livestock farming to one based essentially on services has been correctly managed. The management of this transition has been underpinned by public intervention designed to ensure income stability for companies and to exclude food prices from the pressures of competition. Many lives can be saved, and a marked saving made in healthcare spending, through the adoption of healthy, balanced diets. The statistics also bring new issues to everyone’s attention. I am referring to the safeguarding of food supplies, a factor to which everything else is inevitably connected, and to the quality and balance of the foods that will be available on the market in the coming years.

One of these is that, while shelf food prices have been rising, farmers, including livestock farmers in the EU, are facing an income crisis which is threatening the existence of their farms and reducing them to poverty. We must be aware that the high quality standards imposed on livestock farmers come at a cost. In the case where competition from imports from third countries, which do not impose the same high standards, is not kept under control – let me remind you of the incident involving the milk powder from China infected with melamine – these costs will cause a drop in EU production in this area. Inadequate gestures are being made for the livestock farmers’ benefit. This is why the Commission’s intention to release a quantity of feed cereal is just one step aimed at helping the sector which must be followed by others as well.

This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market.

I cannot forget hearing a British farmer talking in this Chamber about the difficulties he felt when he saw that meat from his animals was unable to compete on the market, such were the requirements imposed on him by legislation. That is the risk we are running and it is well identified in this proposal. It is also clear that the sector’s crisis could result in a significant drop in meat production throughout the EU, leading not only to the disappearance of small and medium-sized producers, but also to a market supply crisis, increased prices and greater dependence on imports. I cannot forget milk production, which is an important issue for Portugal, so I would remind you that the policy of former Commissioner Fischer-Boel regarding milk quotas was severely criticised, and firmly and persistently opposed by farmers.

However, by defending guidelines that caused the problems currently faced by the sector, particularly small and medium-sized producers, it shows itself to be profoundly contradictory, and even contrary to the interests of these producers. The resolution once again advocates subjecting farming and food production to competition and the free market. It also warns of the speculation on foodstuffs that has been taking place, but limits itself to calling for excessive speculation to be fought and therefore believes that speculation on foodstuffs can continue, provided that it is not excessive. For our part, we have said it before and we are saying it again: it is necessary to break with a system that sees food as if it were just another commodity and allows speculation on foodstuffs; this leads to explosive situations of food dependency and price volatility, as has been occurring.</p>

The problems in the sector could put food safety in the EU and provisions of meat for its citizens at risk.

For this reason, it is important for us to take measures which will help livestock farmers to emerge from this difficult period in a stronger position. In addition to the rise in the feed price, two points are particularly important to me. The first is that the high European product and safety standards which our livestock farms have to comply with must be applied to imported products that are sold in the European Union. This would help to ensure that European farmers are not at a major competitive disadvantage to producers in third countries and, at the same time, would guarantee that all the products sold in the European Union are of high quality. The second point is about making agricultural policy simpler and more transparent. Unnecessary regulations take up a lot of time and cost a lot of money. Therefore, it is important that they are removed. This would really make life easier for all the farms within the European Union.

Despite the self-inflicted interruption in supplies, we must not allow our agricultural industry to be contaminated with GMOs. The acceptance of unauthorised GMOs and the establishment of a threshold ‘for adventitious GMOs which are not yet authorised in the European Union’, and which have not yet undergone full scientific testing, have resulted in a flood of authorisations of GMOs in the USA and, in particular, in developing countries. On account of the testing capacity in these countries, this leads to an increased risk of damage to health and the environment. Countries outside the EU now have an increasing influence over authorisation practices within the EU, with the result being an ongoing decline in the health and environmental safety levels of authorised GMOs. In addition, with regard to Amendment 3 that has been adopted, I am not of the opinion that the current ban on meat and bone meal for non-ruminants should be reviewed.

On the one hand, farmers are being paid lower prices by consumers, while on the other, they are faced with major fluctuations in feed prices. It is important for us to prevent a serious crisis occurring in the livestock sector by making immediate use of the available instruments to stabilise the market. Another factor which has an impact on European farmers is the growing competition from third countries where production costs are lower and the increasing tendency in trade policy to exchange larger quantities of food imports for services, without at least requiring the same production standards. I support the resolution which calls for specific measures to be taken on behalf of the livestock sector. I would like to thank Mrs Herranz for her initiative. Against the background of the difficult market situation and the discussion which has been initiated about the future of agricultural policy in the EU, Parliament needs to make a clear commitment to giving all areas of agricultural production the necessary security to allow them to plan for the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">European farmers have been living in a state of serious crisis for some time now. I voted in favour of the resolution precisely in order to get started down a path which will shortly lead to a re-stabilisation of incomes for those people who have made livestock farming their life’s work. Only people who believe in their work put up with what are now grave conditions, frequently living in often difficult circumstances and having to buy their means of production at very high prices. In this vein, allow me to express my heartfelt sympathy for all those farmers in the areas of Italy hit by flooding of late, with the hope that the resolution voted on today may also contribute to their recovery, affording them a satisfactory way of life and work.</p>

      <p sl="de">The European livestock industry is currently undergoing a major crisis, because rocketing production costs are pushing European producers closer and closer to their survival threshold.</p>
      <p sl="de">These very high production costs are directly related to high feed prices and our dependency on third countries for our cereals and protein plants.</p>
      <p sl="de">I expect the Commission to include in its forward-looking legislative proposal on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) efficient market instruments and the necessary funding to ensure that the feed and cereal market remains stable and to guarantee livestock farmers the security to plan for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need a European protein plan which will promote the cultivation of protein and leguminous crops and reduce the dependency of the dairy sector with regard to this strategic type of feed.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we need to reinforce the measures to support livestock farming in disadvantaged areas, including Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission should take a cautious approach in its proposals on milk production, because 70% of the red meat produced in the EU comes from dairy cows.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Europe, we have the strictest animal welfare and hygiene regulations in the world. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the same requirements must apply to imported foods, in order to reduce the competitive disadvantage for our producers caused by unfair competition.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The livestock sector bears the consequences of stringent regulations required by our institutions, the most stringent in the world in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, animal health and welfare. Unfortunately, the crisis in this sector is now having a negative effect leading to a significant loss in revenue for producers, to which we cannot be indifferent. The very least that we should promise, and it is what producers rightly expect, is the reciprocity of these regulations on imports. When, sooner or later, food safety is a matter of global concern, Europe must react to maintain the viability of livestock farming when it is under threat. This investment in the future is vital. This is why the economic impact of the regulations required, namely, legislation on animal welfare, must be assessed and incorporated into long-term planning for the future of the agricultural sector and the livestock sector in particular.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this resolution because the increasing costs of the factors of production and the costs inherent in compliance with EU regulations are currently making the profitability of European livestock farming unviable: the prices obtained by some farmers for basic meat-based products are below production cost. The European agricultural sector is sacrificed in favour of the possibility of the EU exporting other types of product to these countries from a great variety of economic sectors, but mainly from the livestock sector. This resolution advocates measures that could end up helping to combat the crisis in this sector, which is being damaged by speculation on the commodities market, as well as by scrupulous compliance with EU regulation.</p>

      <p sl="de">The crisis in the livestock sector is not only the result of rising production costs. A modern society requires healthy food and high standards of hygiene and animal welfare which can be found in small-scale farming businesses and organic farms. These cause an increase in production costs and consumers then choose cheaper products. While our domestic farmers are subject to strict regulations, it is difficult to monitor the standards which apply to cheap agricultural imports. This is why we need fair prices and a change in the agricultural subsidy system. We must move away from supporting multinational agribusinesses and large-scale hobby farmers like the Queen and instead support small farmers who can only survive by running their farms on a part-time basis alongside another job. This report does not deal with this problem in sufficient detail and, therefore, I have abstained.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I happily voted today in favour of the resolution on the crisis in the EU livestock sector. It called for vital measures to be taken to support the livestock sector in the European Union by focusing attention on the volatility of feed prices and adopting measures so that products imported into the EU meet the same requirements as those met by European goods.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The problem with the state of the livestock sector is prevalent across the whole EU. The livestock sector is faced with the widest variety of challenges: rising feed prices, market speculation, increasing energy prices and growing expenditure associated with the enforcement of European regulations. All of these factors have made production in Europe more expensive. These difficulties apply across the board to all livestock farmers throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, there are additional difficulties on top of these, which some new Member States are facing, such as my country, Bulgaria, for instance. In Bulgaria, only 10% of livestock farmers own their land, which consequently means that only these 10% can benefit from direct payments. This situation is exacerbating the crisis in Bulgaria’s livestock sector. Due to the lack of funds to buy the quantities of feed needed for the winter, many Bulgarian farmers will be forced to slaughter their animals.</p>

With this resolution, Parliament is calling on the European Union, pending adoption of the changes to the common agricultural policy, to release a small quantity of stored grain for animals in order to lower the costs for farmers, while curbing the current strong speculation and imposing tougher price controls to protect the agricultural market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution on the crisis in the European Union’s livestock sector came out of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and has involved several of my colleagues and me, personally. We are concerned that European producers in this sector are experiencing severe hardships and we are determined to take action in the hope of helping to overcome this difficult period. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, because it is a loud call for help for this sector, and because I am convinced that the action now started could make a real contribution to the sector’s sustainability and development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">From this resolution, I would stress the call for the interests of European workers to be safeguarded in the context both of the post-2013 common agricultural policy and of bilateral negotiations, especially with Mercosur. Of the advocated measures, I would stress: effective and flexible meat-market mechanisms; combating speculation on cereals and the creation of a safety net in this sector; adequate protection of farm workers in the most disadvantaged areas, and greater power for producer organisations.</p>

      <p sl="de">The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors. I oppose these market interventions. However, the motion for a resolution also includes important liberal requirements for pragmatic thresholds for GMOs in imported feeds and a review of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal. Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote. In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market. This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system. In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution on the livestock sector is yet another call by Parliament to take into account the growing difficulties faced by our European farmers. With farmers having to comply with more and more rules on traceability, hygiene, animal welfare and respect for the environment, their production costs are now spiralling out of control: fuel, fertilisers and, above all, cereals, currently amount to 60% of the total cost. We call on the Commission and on Commissioner Cioloş for more measures to curb price volatility and to create a safety net. Our livestock farmers must survive the pressure of imports and work within a market where competition is fair. As nobody pays to work, quite simply we want to enable them to make a living from their profession.</p>

The result is not overwhelming, as other groups insisted on pointing to high environmental and animal welfare standards as the reason for lower competitiveness in the EU livestock sector.

However, the resolution refers to the demands adopted in the Bové report and calls for measures to curb speculation and price volatility, as well as pointing out the key demand of the Häusling report for a crop protein plan to reduce dependence on protein crop imports (mainly GM soy) and the specific needs of extensive grassland beef production.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I kept an open mind during the reading of the initial motion for a resolution on the crisis currently faced by the EU livestock sector which, in particular, condemns the lack of transparency within the food supply chain turning producers and consumers into the weak links in the chain, the extreme market volatility faced by the EU dairy sector, in particular, and distortions of competition between EU producers and those from third countries subject to less demanding regulations on food quality and safety, and which reiterates the need for effective market regulation and for a strong budget for the common agricultural policy after 2013, However I ultimately condemn the adoption of this resolution and, in particular, Amendments 1, 2 and 3 which open up the way for genetically-modified soya and maize from third countries on European soil and a return to meat and bone meal in the food of non-ruminants where food safety cannot be guaranteed.

      <p sl="pt">The livestock sector in the European Union is under serious threat, largely as a result of the recent increase in cereal prices. The effect on livestock farming of speculation coming from the cereal sector is worrying. It is not just market volatility associated with the economic crisis that we are experiencing, but there is also a serious threat of disturbance in all branches of the livestock sector, making the adoption of a series of genuine measures capable of combating the crisis that we are witnessing urgently required in order to prevent future negative developments. As well as the necessary technical rules on food safety and animal welfare, it would be desirable if other improved measures capable of preventing the current situation developing into something more serious could be implemented, for example, the release of cereal stocks stored in intervention, in order to make it possible to minimise the issue of price volatility and prevent the delicate situation that we have been witnessing from getting worse.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, the food sector is one of the priority sectors both for Lithuania and the whole of the European Union. We have already seen what can happen to energy supply and prices when the EU is dependent on imports. This must not be repeated in the food sector. Livestock holdings have faced a serious threat from the recent increase in cereal prices in the EU, as well as extreme climatic conditions and speculation. This means that certain EU sectors, such as the pigmeat sector (an important branch of Lithuanian agriculture), have suffered a blow due to feed prices, which represent up to 60% of all production costs. EU livestock production systems are important for maintaining livelihoods. Lithuania may face serious consequences as a result of the crisis in the livestock sector. The agricultural sector, which employs around 8% of our workers, is an important part of our economy. Wheat and other grains are the principal areas of production. In the EU-27, there are more than 130 million livestock units. According to EU statistics, the number of livestock has fallen by 25% since 1990. A further drop in the number of livestock in the EU may cause significant changes in production, which would upset the supply of food in the EU. Such fluctuations may cause serious disturbances in the livestock sector.</p>
