    <intervention id="3-007" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Didier Reynders" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the meeting of the ECOFIN Council, which has just taken place in Brussels, has enabled us to make progress on two issues, by adopting the European Semester, within the framework of budgetary consolidation and of the new budget monitoring procedures, and also by endorsing the agreement reached during a trialogue with the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, of course, on all the financial supervision texts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Alongside this, we have launched two debates, which will be continued at the end of this month at the informal ECOFIN Council meeting and with which we hope to make progress over the next six months: one on the bank resolution funds, or bank levy, and the other on the tax on financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say a few words on both these points. With regard to the European Semester, this is a first step and one which will enable us, from 1 January next year, to introduce the new budgetary procedure with the Commission. We will call on the Member States, in spring, to submit certain budgetary data, the parameters used to prepare their budgets, the broad guidelines – without any detailed examination of each heading – before we continue with this procedure. We also hope to be able to add further provisions, among other things, and here I am thinking about provisions relating to sanctions. In any event, the Presidency will support the process by which to impose these sanctions, at the initiative of the Commission and, if possible, with a specific role being given to the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to supervision, I wanted, once again, to thank the rapporteurs and all the Members who participated in this attempt to reach a consensus on the various texts, and also the Commission, Michel Barnier and his teams, as well as the successive Presidencies. I am referring here to the Spanish and the Swedish Presidencies, which preceded us. We now have texts which, from 1 January next year, will enable us to establish new surveillance and supervision structures and the Systemic Risk Board. This process will enable us to make progress under the right conditions, with a new architecture for the financial system and its supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should just like to point out that, although this has indeed been a long process, we have not finished yet; rather, this is the beginning of a new kind of European organisation and, very likely, the beginning of lengthy debates which will result in the adoption of various texts, which Commissioner Barnier will have the opportunity to present over the coming weeks. We are going to try to keep to a strict timetable on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have now dealt with the two points which were the subject of formal decisions taken by the ECOFIN. Moreover, debates have been held, as I was saying, on two other issues: the first on bank resolution funds, or the bank levy, and the second – the debates must be kept very separate – on the tax on financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, where the bank levy and the bank resolution funds are concerned, the debate which took place during the ECOFIN meeting yielded a number of guidelines which will enable the Commission to present more detailed and more specific proposals. I am convinced that, by applying the same proactive approach that we applied to financial supervision, we should be able to conclude this debate over the coming months with the creation of mechanisms which will ensure real coordination across Europe. Some countries have already imposed a levy on the banking sector, but it is important for us to progress in a coordinated fashion. I acknowledge that there are still some issues to be addressed. We will, in fact, be discussing these at finance minister level during the informal Council meeting at the end of this month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the tax on financial transactions, the debate is much livelier. We have further to go in reaching a consensus, but that is normal. This was an initial in-depth debate which allowed for specific questions to be asked about the ability to implement such a tax, but also about the ability to implement it in the EU or to discuss it with other partners. We will also revisit this issue at the end of this month in preparation for the G20 meetings, because it is clearly important for the majority of participants that we discuss it with our partners, not only on the other side of the Atlantic, but also in emerging countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To finish, I will simply say that many determined efforts still need to be made on this issue, and then choices will have to be made. If a tax of this type is introduced one day, how will the receipts be used? Some will earmark them for their national budgets, others will finance measures necessary to combat climate change, while others – and in Belgium, for example, we have already done this – will use them to finance development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There we are, Madam President; that is what I have to report on the Council meeting that has just taken place in Brussels.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-008" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, honourable Members, I, in turn, after Mr Reynders, would like to say a few words about our approach to this Ecofin Council meeting. I will do so on behalf of my fellow Commissioners, Olli Rehn and Algirdas Šemeta, who participated in this work with me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Four points marked this meeting, as the Belgian minister has pointed out. Since Parliament has played a very large part in this, please allow me to begin with a major subject that I consider structural and to which I have devoted much of my energy ever since you placed your trust in us in February. I am talking about supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is because supervision is the cornerstone, the framework within which, brick by brick, week after week, product after product, market after market or actor after actor, we will be able to learn the lessons of the crisis and put in place intelligent regulation and effective supervision, so that at the end of the journey – and we are not there yet – no actor, no product, no market and no territory will escape from intelligent regulation and effective supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to offer a very sincere word of thanks on this subject – and I am confident that Parliament will, in turn, be able to adopt the outcome of the trialogue in a few weeks’ time – to your rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Skinner, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mrs Goulard, Mr Giegold, Mr Tremosa i Balcells and Mr Balz, and to the committee chair, Mrs Bowles, who managed this trialogue with great determination. I would also like to say that the Belgian President-in-Office, Mr Reynders, played a highly personal and proactive role, relying not only on the work of his team, but also on the work that the Spanish and Swedish Presidencies had done before him.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that the initial reason behind this Commission proposal on supervision was the highly intelligent work carried out by Jacques de Larosière to draw the first main lesson from this crisis. As a result, on 1 January, we will have some European bodies. The Commission will work hard, as is its duty, to prepare the implementation of these three authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. I talked about European radar screens and control towers. These are clearly needed because, as we know, half of the banks in half of the countries of Europe, which you represent, are based in other countries. Therefore, we are generally dealing with financial establishments that are transnational in nature and, consequently, have systemic dimensions and risks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Presidency and to offer my very sincere thanks to Parliament and your rapporteurs for the essential work that they put in to make this ‘very first stage’, as Mr Reynders put it, a success. Now the building work begins.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will see that we will be filling out this framework week by week. Starting next week, I will put forward the regulation on derivatives and the regulation on short selling, and then, a little later on, the one on credit rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two points for debate that also concern the financial sector, in relation to ideas about contributions and taxation. One is more advanced than the other, and I agree with the Belgian President-in-Office that we should not mix up the two subjects, as they are different, even though they both concern financing by the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is this idea of resolution funds. This is a debate that has already begun in the Council. I must tell the honourable Members that these Council debates are very useful, as I saw for myself yesterday, because the table rounds help one begin to see things a little more clearly. I opened this debate under the Spanish Presidency in Madrid at an informal Council meeting, when I presented the idea of a toolbox for preventing crises in the banking and financial sector with two simple ideas. The first is that prevention is always cheaper than the cure – that is true for the environment and for financial crises as well – while the second simple idea is that taxpayers should no longer be in the front line, because the banks should pay for the banks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Based on these ideas, then, we presented the contents of a toolbox, which included resolution funds. In this respect, I would like to emphasise the equally very important work that Mrs Ferreira has done on your behalf. In October, I will issue a communication based on the views of Parliament and Mrs Ferreira and on the reactions from the Council of Ministers. Why in October? Because by then, we will also have made progress on the important Basel process, with the obligations of qualitative and quantitative capitalisation of own funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You all know that when we speak of contributions by banks or prevention in banks, all the pieces have to be put together, and we have to pay attention to what I have called the ‘sizing’ of these measures to ensure that they are effective and that no one escapes from them. It will not be business as usual, but at the same time, we must not penalise the economy without looking at the cumulative effect of all these measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In October, therefore, I will issue a communication on the prevention of future crises and the responsibility of the banks and the resolution fund, ideas about which are progressing, since Germany has just implemented this idea. Sweden had already done so. We are going to try to build a coordinated system with a common core, which will avoid poor coordination, or even competition, and double taxation on banking establishments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Reynders said, a debate has just begun. This one, on taxing financial transactions at a global level, is much more difficult. The debate started in the G20. Not everyone was enthusiastic. Many of us think that it is a fair idea and that, in a modest but effective way, financial transactions ought to be able to contribute to the funding of a number of major worldwide challenges to make the world a fairer and therefore more stable and secure place. This world we live in will only be more secure if it is fairer, which is not the case today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are well aware of all the challenges – like the environment, climate change and food – and the crises, which, moreover, hit the poorest countries the hardest. Many of us think it is a fair idea, but it is a long way from gaining a consensus in the Council of Ministers, to say the least. We will have to carry on working on it. My fellow Commissioner, Algirdas Šemeta, has written an initial information memo and, on the basis of the work done in the Council of Ministers, we will draw up a new communication on taxation of the financial sector in particular. This communication is scheduled for October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not repeat what Mr Reynders has said about the stability and convergence programme, the efforts made by the Commission and the work done by the task force. I will just mention the idea – which I find useful – of a European Semester, which will put the budgetary analysis of each of our countries into perspective while preserving their sovereignty, and will provide a snapshot – another European radar screen – of the countries’ general economic policy guidelines. The Council will also work on the basis of the Commission’s papers and reports on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At dinner, Mr Reynders raised two points for discussion, which I will describe in brief. One of them, which concerns me and all of us here, is the operation of the IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board. We would like to see a reform of its governance and greater transparency. I have also told the Presidency that I am ready to table a report of interest to Parliament about transatlantic regulation at the September informal Council meeting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are not alone within the G20, and not even among Americans and Europeans, but it is extremely important for us to ensure that there is parallelism between the measures taken under President Obama’s authority by the US Congress and the measures taken by Europe as regards supervision and regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am currently setting up a kind of scoreboard comparing what is being done in the United States at the moment with what we are doing in Europe to ensure such parallelism. It is a question of achieving the same objectives without necessarily using the same methods or measures. I believe it will be a useful tool for the ministers and for the Members of this Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-009" speaker_id="28167" name="Corien Wortmann-Kool" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, on behalf of the European People’s Party, I would like to say that we are very pleased with the agreement reached on a system for European banking supervision. That is an important milestone. A number of Member States initially dug their heels in, but our rapporteurs have been steadfast and, thanks to a persuasive Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency’s firm line, we were able to secure this result. Another positive result has been the introduction of the European Semester. Both are important steps towards strengthening economic governance in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the ECOFIN Council, you have also debated various forms of bank taxes, because banks, too, must contribute to dealing with the impact of the crisis. You have rightly tried to achieve this at G20 level, but with little progress. For this reason, the EPP Group agrees with the conclusion that, if we fail to achieve this internationally, then we in Europe can – no, must – take the lead by introducing a bank tax or a bank levy. However, we must do this in a coordinated fashion, because Member States are already introducing such levies themselves and that is posing a threat to our internal market.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, Commissioner Barnier, I would strongly encourage you to use your right of initiative to bring about a coordinated bank levy across Europe, one that will be introduced according to the same criteria in every country. In this matter, just as in the matter of European supervision, this House will rally to your side.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When it comes to the financial transaction tax, now, that is an excellent item which you will have to work hard to place much more prominently on the G20 agenda. However, one thing I would warn you against is Europe going solo. I know that my fellow Member, Mr Schulz, would like to enforce such a transaction tax in Europe, but its disadvantages would outweigh the advantages, because we are dealing with a global system. Such a tax would lead to transactions bypassing Europe. We should, therefore, put our efforts into introducing a successful European bank tax and continue to operate in the G20 context.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010" speaker_id="4267" name="Udo Bullmann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, congratulations on your supervision. Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character.</p>
      <p sl="de">A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response.</p>

    <intervention id="3-011" speaker_id="97137" name="Sylvie Goulard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission and the Belgian Presidency for having helped us get EU financial supervision on track.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I know we are now thanking one another but I should like nonetheless to emphasise that it was fortunate that Parliament pointed out, last December, how the Member States, while claiming they wanted to resolve the crisis using European solutions, were busy implementing every safety net and every safeguard clause imaginable to ensure that these European authorities could definitely not act without intergovernmental agreements. I think that we have all worked very well together, but let us give praise where praise is due.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As rapporteur for the Systemic Risk Board, I should like to highlight in particular one extremely positive point. Mr Barnier frequently refers to radars and control towers, but each aircraft also has a pilot, and that pilot is the President of the European Central Bank, whom Parliament is very keen to see remain in that role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I should like to express a slight feeling of dissatisfaction with regard to the direct supervision of pan-European entities and, above all, ask you to continue the fight in that regard. In the sectoral texts, we must continue – as the four main groups in Parliament have jointly undertaken to do – to provide the EU Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) with powers over these entities, over the rating agencies. This is theoretically already happening, and we are waiting for the Commission to continue its work and to extend it to clearing houses and, eventually, to cross-border groups. The challenge in this area was simple: we could either have an internal market subject to EU regulation and supervision, or settle for loose coordination, which would mean quibbling – or chipotage, as we say under the Belgian Presidency – between nation states.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-012" speaker_id="96730" name="Sven Giegold" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, this is indeed an important moment for Europe because we seem to have reached an agreement on supervision. We have achieved a lot by working together on this issue. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, the Commission, Mr Barnier, and my fellow Members from the various groups. We have taken a really enormous step forward, giving the lie to all those who said that Europe would no longer progress any further. On the contrary, we need to introduce stringent regulations for the internal market. We are now on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: the Ecofin Council has already made some important decisions in relation to the monitoring of the budgets of Member States. I would like to thank the Commission for the progress made. You have presented a number of proposals. We are now awaiting more proposals in relation to macro-economic coordination. Given the crisis, this is urgently needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would now like to discuss the financial transaction tax. What we have heard from the Commission so far is a cacophony of contradictory signals. On the one hand, Mr Barnier and Mr Barroso are thankfully in support of the idea of a financial transaction tax. At the same time, Mr Šemeta rejects the proposal. I am calling on you to deal with this issue in a collegial way. You must speak with one voice. It simply will not do for Mr Šemeta to present a report containing results that have long been refuted in academic circles.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, there was some relevant information to be found in the study the European Parliament commissioned from the Bruegel Institute. This study refutes relevant arguments raised by Mr Šemeta. I also wonder why he is not here. He has been criticised several times in the House on this issue. Today of all days, he should face up to this debate. I also wonder whether he will now have to stay behind after class – after all, that is what has been decided: his contribution will have to be revised. Is this really going to result in a proposal to be presented by the Commission, an initiative they intend to present, or are we just to have another study document? This really is not good enough! Something else that is not good enough is to postpone the Council’s decision until France has the Presidency of the G20 Group. This is not acceptable!</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the central countries that have rejected this proposal, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Spain, also have questions to answer. It was already known that the United Kingdom and Sweden would not be in favour. However, Spain is a member of the Euro Group. The country is governed by Social Democrats. Perhaps they should seek to establish more coherence between the good position they have adopted in this House and the positions adopted by the Spanish Government in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, all I can say is that I would like greater clarity from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) here in this House regarding their position. You have just made some extremely critical comments about the financial transaction tax, although large parts of your group are in favour. I am not convinced that you are really speaking for the majority of your group. We need united action in this situation, otherwise our citizens will become cynical if we are to have cost-saving measures on the one hand, but no revenue from levying capital income in Europe on the other.</p>

    <intervention id="3-013" speaker_id="96920" name="Kay Swinburne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Belgian Presidency on its negotiating skills, and Commissioner Barnier and his team for finding solutions on supervision. But I would like to turn to those unresolved issues of financial transactions at yesterday’s ECOFIN.</p>
      <p sl="en">I seem to spend a lot of my time in Parliament asking for people to conduct research, write impact assessments and do studies. This week’s ECOFIN has gone out and done just that. Instead of looking at purely political concepts and legislating in haste, the Council meeting and Commissioner Šemeta’s contributions have been based on facts and figures. A good example of better regulation principles in practice. However, when an independent assessment states that one Member State would end up collecting in excess of 70% of the revenue generated from a financial transaction tax, it would be ludicrous to claim that such a tax should be implemented at an EU level, if at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">An FTT is not free money, as the popular media would have us believe. The banks and financial intermediaries would not be the ones to pay for a transaction tax. It would be the pensioners reliant on their returns in the market and companies in the real economy paying for every hedging transaction. It is time to recognise the limitations of the simplistic FTT and, if our true aim is to modify the behaviour of banks without destroying our economies, look at the more complex solution of a financial activities tax or bank levies as proposed by the IMF instead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of derailing the process by calling for unachievable and unwanted EU-wide taxes that many Member States, not just my own, are against, we must look at this as an opportunity for strengthening our Members States’ weak public finances and allowing them to use the money as they see fit, replenishing their public coffers depleted by bank bail-outs and crisis management.</p>

    <intervention id="3-014" speaker_id="28406" name="Miguel Portas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="pt">Ecofin has decided to launch the European Semester, which is aimed at ensuring consistency between European economic policy and national budgetary policies. My question is this: have they given any thought to democracy? I am all in favour of coordination. I accept goals for the deficit, and I would even like to see such goals put in place for job creation. I accept amendments to the national budgets, although I would prefer it if the sanctions were not stupid and did not exacerbate the problem, so I am quite open to this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What I find completely unacceptable is Brussels deciding how the Member States are to meet their commitments, because this means expropriating the fundamental prerogatives of national parliaments. Ecofin will have more than prior approval; it is setting out the guidelines that are to govern every national budget. I heard Mr Reynders say: OK, but we will not go into detail about this. Thank you for your magnanimity, but the basic problem is that the main guidelines will apply to 27 governments. Of these 27 governments, Germany will always be telling Greece what it has to do, but not vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, the members of national parliaments are not blanks that need to be filled in. Members of national parliaments cannot simply be divorced from freedom of choice in their budgets, which is a crucial political choice.</p>

    <intervention id="3-015" speaker_id="4238" name="Hans-Peter Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by paying you a compliment. It is obvious that you are willing. The question is just: Are you allowed to be willing? With regard to the process that you are pursuing with such enormous dedication, I would call on you urgently to make the matter clear to our citizens by outlining the reason for the failure despite all the good will shown, and by explaining why we have only made limited progress on the four cornerstones that are central to the issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is apparent that we need clarity on why the supervision of the financial markets in the US is stricter and more critical in key areas than what you are trying to establish now. We also need clear answers as to how you actually intend dealing with the problem of the conduit banks and what degree of success we can expect there. We also need clarifications in relation to capital. What is the Commission’s intention? There is plenty of detail here, but how do you intend making sure that a crash cannot happen again?</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to ask a question as a representative of a small Member State: What can we do to limit the problem of banks that are too big to fail? In Austria, we have a situation with one bank, Hypo Group Alpe Adria, where, if the loans were to be called in, the burden of debt on the Austrian state would be so high that we would find ourselves in the same category as Greece. Is the Commission issuing a warning about this? What is it doing? How does it intend to prevent Austria from becoming another Greece for the European Union?</p>

    <intervention id="3-016" speaker_id="28193" name="Jean-Paul Gauzès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I should naturally like to add my congratulations on the good result obtained in the area of supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found.</p>

    <intervention id="3-017" speaker_id="39317" name="Anni Podimata" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commission, yesterday’s decisions by the ECOFIN Council, in conjunction of course with the agreement on a new effective system of financial supervision, are essential steps towards the new economic governance which we envisage. However, we face a broad challenge today. No one can or should stop the imposition of stricter budgetary discipline and stricter supervision.</p>
      <p sl="el">The challenge is to design a new economic model which responds to the demand of European citizens for full employment and fair growth. We therefore need to strike a balance between budgetary discipline and safeguarding the necessary resources for sustainable growth and full employment through public and private investments.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore need to address macro-economic balances and the competitive divide between the Member States which will inevitably lead to economic and social inequalities. Above all, however, we need a model for the fairer distribution of the cost of recovery and fiscal justice and taxing financial transactions could play a catalytic role.</p>
      <p sl="el">Europe can and must play a leading role on this issue. It did so in combating climate change by making unilateral commitments. It can and must lead efforts to promote similar regulations at international level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to thank and support the Commission and the Council for their work on ensuring adequate financing from the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, however, a couple of issues. We support introducing a form of coordinated stability level and a fund, but when it comes to the financial transaction tax, we are talking about an entirely different and much more complex issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">That tax, as a minimum, would have to be global to avoid tax evasion. Furthermore, a tax on all transactions might not only be technically infeasible, but would also risk making the markets more volatile and less liquid.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have some questions on taxes. If the purpose is to generate money for global causes, which money pots does the revenue go into, and who has the responsibility for distributing the money? For a tax for a specific purpose, when do we ever know when enough is enough? Finally, the key question is who will collect the tax – the Member States or the EU? If it is the EU, far away from its citizens, how do we prevent constant rising taxes? In the real world, enough never seems to be enough when it comes to politicians’ need for additional money.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, allow me to welcome Mr Reynders. I hope everything is well with you. As regards the bank levy, I do not, in principle, have any problems with it at all. I just wonder how it is supposed to work in practice. It reminds me of a bus: everyone wants to get on it, but everyone wants to go in a different direction. As for the financial transaction tax, I think it is a good example of a bad idea. It is basically a sort of European Tobin tax. Although, we do not call it that any more, because nowadays even Mr Tobin himself is opposed to that tax. It scares capital away and Sweden has been a very good example of that. This also begs the question of what we are going to do with the revenue from such a tax? Are we going to use it to contribute to the EU’s own resources? This issue is bound to be very divisive, so my advice to you, Mr Reynders, is: there might be very good intentions behind your plan, but please drop it. Put the plan on ice or, better still, leave it outside to die of hypothermia. Surely, we cannot just go solo. Now, I would like to pick up on what Mr Schulz has said, although he does not appear to be listening to me right now. Yesterday, he said that he would like to force the European Commission to take the initiative on the financial transaction tax. He wants to bring people out onto the streets. My advice would be, do not go down that route. We will take a European citizens’ initiative against this tax because it is the ordinary man on the street who will have to pay it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Reynders, I have five points to make. Firstly, I must say that I find it regrettable such an important Ecofin meeting as yesterday’s was held at the same time as the address by the President of the Commission on the state of the Union. I would expect better coordination. If we are all to pull in the same direction, we need to be aware of the topics and highlights that concern the European Union; we need to coordinate our efforts, listen to each other and talk to one another. Such parallel scheduling is entirely unnecessary and does a disservice to both events.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second issue I would like to mention is supervision. I would like to thank the Presidency of the Council, the Commissioner and Parliament. If it were not for the decision by Parliament in July, progress would never have been made over the summer and we would not have supervision with teeth. If it were not for the decision by Parliament in July, the President of the European Central Bank would not be heading up the macro-supervision authority. These matters were tightened up through the active cooperation of Parliament and the Belgian Presidency with the support of the Commission. I would like to thank you warmly for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is in relation to the Europeanisation of the drafting of the budget. We must be aware that the second pillar of monetary union will only work if we pursue economic and social union and europeanise budgetary policy and taxation policy as a first step, rather than simply coordinating them.</p>
      <p sl="de">My fourth point is that, while we need a bank levy, this should not be allowed to become a bottomless pit. The levy should have a European objective and be ring-fenced for European purposes and the European Monetary Fund should be established.</p>
      <p sl="de">My fifth point is in relation to the financial transaction tax. By now, those in favour and those against the tax must feel like they have been going around in circles to no avail. Mr Reynders, you have just commented that this has been the first serious debate on the issue. However, we have been talking about it for a year. We have been asking questions. We have been adopting resolutions. First you seem to shift responsibility to the G20, then to the Commission and finally to the Member States. We want these five questions to be answered. What is to be the basis for assessment? What is the percentage rate to be? Who will impose the levy? Who is going to get the money and what for? Present a project to us, then we can discuss the matter further and finally do something practical.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the coordination of efforts for the European Semester which was discussed yesterday at Ecofin is a positive step in itself, but it is only one part of the picture. Growth and employment need to be priorities, as well as fulfilment of the Stability and Growth Pact. The creation of the European Monetary Fund is crucial. Sovereign debt needs to be handled alongside all the other obligations for participation in a monetary area. It is vital that the development of this project does not go down the dangerous route of sanctions, and I am counting on Commissioner Barnier and his experience to guide the Commission in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, I would also like to congratulate him sincerely on the financial supervision work that he has carried out. I believe that Commissioner Barnier, in particular, along with Parliament and the Belgian Presidency have managed to reach a good agreement: one which respects us and defends the interests of the European public. My hope is that the missing agenda will follow the same methodology and that we will achieve the same success.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, I would like to say that I very much hope that when it comes to the banking crisis, particularly for systemic and cross-border banks, any progress will help to consolidate the European position.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, Commissioner, it is essential to revisit our agenda for the G20, especially if we do not want to give up the fight against fraud, tax evasion and tax havens, and if we want there to be an effective and more decisive contribution from banks and financial services …</p>

It has been a delicate balancing act between protecting markets from cross-border risks and yet also maintaining national governments’ responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner has described this, quite rightly, as just the first brick. I look forward to working with the Commission to ensure that future bricks do not overtopple that delicate balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamentally, it is no good for Member States to agree standards internationally and then fail to implement them domestically. I hope that this will ensure that we all abide by our international rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the debate, many of my colleagues said that it was important that the head of the ESRB was the head of the ECB. We promised to listen to him when he warned us of risks. Yesterday, he warned the Council of the risk of a financial transaction tax and told us that this could be a disaster for Europe.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Members have indicated – Mr Gauzès just now and yesterday during the State of the Union debate – we need more Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More Europe to create growth and employment, to regulate the markets and to reduce inequality. This is the contention of my group chair, Mr Daul, and one which I fully support. I believe that Member States have finally realised that we needed to be bolder in economic and budgetary matters. Bolder and, above all else, responsible: national protectionist responses are a recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need greater financial supervision at European level; the agreement with the Council on the financial supervision package, which we will vote on at the next plenary session, is excellent news in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, as well as supervising the system, we must establish real coordination of our budgetary and economic policies. We must create both budgetary federalism and economic federalism. Having a common monetary policy but independent budgetary policies paralyses us. I think that federalism has begun with this new European Semester, which requires Member States to submit their budgetary strategies before the summer each year to the Council for its opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, as is often the case at EU level, what happens in practice will determine the rules much more than texts. For my part, I want this coordination to be more than just a formal exercise and to result in a true common strategy for our economic, industrial and social policies. I regret that the national parliaments and the European Parliament are not yet fully involved in this coordination process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Minister, as a representative of the Council, I am therefore addressing you in particular: parliaments, as budgetary authorities, must play an essential role in the emergence of a European economic policy, as that is the only way to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency on the unanimous adoption by the Council of the compromise reached with Parliament and the Commission on the supervisory package.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have been working with the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies and have managed to complete our task with an ambitious compromise that lays the solid foundations for financial reform and represents a milestone in the integration of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Adopting the European Semester as of next year is also a very positive step, though it involves a lot more than just arranging an operations schedule: it requires substantial content and a parliamentary dimension.</p>
      <p sl="es">Greater reform of economic governance is called for. It is required to mobilise the underused economic growth capacity and to build the social and economic Union we need.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also need a coherent, robust and credible European prevention, management and crisis resolution system. It has to be compatible with economic recovery, foresee moral hazards, bear in mind the rest of the financial reform burdens and avoid distortions in the internal market sphere. We have to coordinate internally in order to be able to bring it before the G20.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am finishing. As regards the financial transaction tax, we are awaiting a communication from the Commission that may also take into account a tax on financial activities. What is at stake here is the fight against volatility, a fair distribution of the financial burden, alleviating the impact of the crisis on public finances, establishing new resources for the European Union and contributing to the Millennium Development Goals. If we want to be a global player, we cannot act separately.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Reynders and Commissioner Barnier very much for their support on the supervisory package, which sometimes felt a bit like trying to push a boiled egg through a tea-strainer, but finally we got through it. I hope our work on Solvency II and its implementing measures will be more productive and much faster. I trust that will be the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many positives which have been pointed out already today – and many negatives – but I would like to agree with the progress that has already been made and what we should aim for. Europe though – and not just the eurozone, it has to be said – needs performance-enhancing regulations as well as safeguards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have the feeling that nations are being made to feel like outcasts, and this must be stopped. It is self-destructive for the EU as a whole. The international agenda is key. The European Union has got to play a significant and crucial role in creating global standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is that if we believe that creating standards in Europe alone is enough, we will make a grave error. That is why I welcome Commissioner Barnier’s remarks about table for the European Union and the USA of comparative regulatory achievement. My office has already drawn up such a table. I would be very happy to share the contents of that with you, Commissioner. I hope it will be useful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally I might ask: where are we in dealing with the Transatlantic Economic Council, the higher-level regulatory dialogue? Where do we expect to go in the future? We have problems before us we cannot solve on our own.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the ECOFIN Council approved the principle of the European Semester. As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens?</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake.</p>

Something which I, personally, am very pleased about is the emphasis given to the role of the European Central Bank. We are, I think, safer under the new arrangements. The experience of the European Central Bank allows us to look to the future with optimism, and the establishment of the European system of financial supervision bodies should be treated as a step in the right direction. We have begun in earnest the coordination of policy on spending, and are not interested only in collecting taxes in Europe. The reporting system will be very important. Please remember that national governments, which make decisions and oblige themselves to observe the rules on budget deficit, are not the only body authorised to spend money in their country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is not only the Stability and Growth Pact which is in need of reform, but also the economic and social model as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The economic and social model, a particular feature of the European Union, is proving to be untenable at the moment. Initially regarded as a driving force for economic growth, as well as for social protection, it has failed to realise these expectations. Ten per cent of Europeans are out of work, while some Member States are still deep in recession.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, we have shortcomings when it comes to controlling economic flows in the EU, which have been clearly highlighted by the economic crisis. This makes macro-economic supervision of Europe’s economies a necessity, especially as the latter are closely linked through the single market and single currency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I therefore welcome the ECOFIN conclusions on establishing a basis for macro-financial supervision in the European Union, with the help of setting up the European Systemic Risk Board and the supervisory authorities for the banking, insurance and securities sectors, not to mention the monitoring of national budgets within a European Semester.</p>

While speculators continue to help themselves to scandalous salaries and effective taxation of financial transactions remains elusive, with tax havens flourishing, they have seized the opportunity provided by the crisis to launch the biggest attack on democracy yet. They have tried to turn members of national parliaments into European puppets in order to force national budgets towards preliminary examination by Europe’s leaders, as though the clearly conditional nature of the Stability and Growth Pact and its irrational criteria were not enough.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The so-called ‘economic coordination’ set out in the treaties cannot justify this trampling, whether at European or national level, of the Member States’ sovereignty, at this painful time in their economic and social development. They have gone too far in defending the interests of economic and financial groups, and this will have serious consequences for those in poverty within the European Union. This is why we are protesting here, and we are certain that the struggle of the workers and people of the European Union is going to intensify.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to thank each and every one of you for what you have said with regard to the collective outcome achieved in the area of supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to return to what Mrs Ferreira just said about our citizens being shaken, affected by all these financial, economic and social crises, without forgetting the food and environmental crises. I believe that we must make a point of demonstrating to our citizens that we are learning lessons from the crisis, because they are the people who elect you, and we are accountable to them. This is what we have just done with regard to supervision; we just need to communicate and explain it, which is what we have started to do. Here I am thinking about Mrs McCarthy’s report on CRD III and remuneration. I believe that, when it comes to all of the issues that have shocked, shaken and affected our citizens and elected representatives, we, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, must demonstrate that we are providing EU-level responses, and specific responses at that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the tax on transactions, Commissioner Šemeta has completed a very important and useful task in analysing the various options and the consequences of establishing this tax if it were applied on a regional basis only. I think that this is an important task. I would say to Mr Giegold that, at the G20 in Toronto, the President of the Commission clearly took a stand, on our behalf, in favour of an equitable and substantial levy on financial services. We will confirm his position in October. You therefore do not have very long to wait, Mr Karas. I should also like to say to Mrs Figueiredo that this debate is continuing. It is no good us being right on our own. We have to convince the people of Europe and, as Mr Reynders can explain better than I, there is still a long way to go at EU-27 level, an awfully long way to go. Then, the other regions of the world will also need to be convinced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Swinburne and Mrs Ford, believe that, if this tax is to be truly effective, it must be established on as broad a base as possible. This is why we have to convince the other regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While I am talking about the world, I should like to say a word about global governance. I can confirm to Mr Skinner that we are going to prepare this comparative table. Furthermore, once this exercise has been completed for the US and the EU, I think it should be extended to the other regions of the world, which I have just mentioned: China, India, Brazil, and Africa as well, which has a contribution to make and is very much affected. I shall therefore make sure I use all the information referred to by Mr Skinner. With regard to governance, which Mrs Podimata and Mr Martin, too, mentioned, we do not yet have the same methods or the same legislation because our economies are very different. Mr Martin quoted Volcker’s famous ‘too big to fail’ strategy. Our analysis in Europe is different: for every bank, irrespective of its size and range of activities, there must be good external and internal supervision and good governance, and the diversity of its activities should not necessarily be curtailed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament clearly plays an essential role with regard to supervision. Mrs Goulard mentioned the work done at your behest to improve the credibility of the agencies. Mr Nitras referred to the key role of the European Central Bank, whose President is going to become the first chair of the Systemic Risk Board, with the task of ensuring that that institution is credible. Mr Karas also mentioned that, thanks to you and to the original and exceptional decision you all took in July to postpone your first-reading vote until autumn, we have had the time to convince and make progress with the Council. I have not forgotten all that and I should like to thank you again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to finish by mentioning, as Mrs Auconie said, that we need ‘more Europe’. Please allow me to express my conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that we must regulate. We must supervise and learn lessons from the crisis. We must improve public finances, because today’s debts are the taxes of future generations. We must have governance. I am going to finish with a few words on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Governance is not enough. We must also support an economic project. This is what President Barroso wished to say to you very forcefully yesterday, and what we are going to pursue. It is also the context in which you will have to interpret the proposals we make in the autumn, through the Single Market Act, to improve the functioning of the internal market and to guarantee the 1% or 2% growth which Europe could achieve if the internal market operated better.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude with economic coordination, which many of you have mentioned. I should like to remind you that at the end of this month, Commissioner Rehn and President Barroso will be submitting some fairly strong proposals for action in the area of governance. With regard to the European Semester, mentioned by Mr Portas, Mr Giegold, Mr Karas, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mr Cutaş and Mrs Auconie, you clearly have the political will to support this new method of coordination, of radar screens, of real-time snapshots, of proactive action towards governments while respecting, Madam President, the prerogatives and the sovereignty of national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that this is very important. I was a member of the French Parliament and a senator for 20 years. I would have been very happy if, when I voted on my country’s budget, I had been given an independent and objective overview of what was happening in other countries, how they were achieving – sometimes alone and using different methods – the same jointly agreed objectives and disciplines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like you to know that, as far as all these coordination and governance issues are concerned, the Commission does have the political will and that Commissioner Rehn’s door is always open.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank you and to thank all the speakers who have expressed their approval of the agreement on financial supervision. As many people have said, this has been a joint effort by Parliament – particularly by its rapporteurs – the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I said a moment ago, we are at the start of a process and, in order to demonstrate that this supervision really represents added value and perhaps the first lesson learned from the financial crisis, we must first make sure that the individuals who will be in charge of this supervision are chosen as objectively as possible – and I believe that the procedures adopted are along these lines – and then, if we want, as many people in this Chamber have requested, to move towards supervision that is increasingly European in scope, we must demonstrate the effectiveness of that supervision in the various areas. We will be able to progress even further simply by demonstrating the effectiveness of European-level supervision. I repeat, however: establishing this new architecture is probably the first and most important lesson learned from the financial crisis. It is now up to us to make it work as well as possible and to strengthen, I repeat, step by step, the truly European character of this new supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second comment I wish to make – Mr Gauzès alluded to it a moment ago – is that, this afternoon, we will once again be working in a trialogue; we will be discussing investment funds further. I believe that everyone needs to take action and agree to the same process which we have just successfully carried out in the area of financial supervision. It is true that there are still some hold-ups within the Council, and debates are taking place within your Chamber on certain aspects relating to the changes to investment funds, but this is an issue on which progress must be made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, together with Commissioner Barnier, we really want to set a tight deadline for the entry into force of new texts. With regard to investment funds – we will try to make progress starting from this afternoon – we must adopt the same approach and try to establish a framework that is a European framework and which actually protects citizens and consumers with regard to certain products and activities that are developed in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should just like to say that, in order to assess how the work is progressing in the area of regulation and supervision, Commissioner Barnier has announced the intention, during the informal ECOFIN Council meeting, to compare, in a way, what is happening on both sides of the Atlantic. I should like to confirm to you that I intend to invite the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, during this informal ECOFIN meeting, to address this issue and to debate the progress of the work, which involves not only the Council and the Commission but also Parliament. At the end of this month, we will therefore have an opportunity to discuss this issue with Parliament also. It is important to acknowledge the changes that we too are making, on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third element I wish to discuss is the taxation of financial transactions – since I do not want to examine the resolution funds again; Commissioner Barnier will, as he has announced, present some specific proposals over the next few weeks. With regard to the taxation of financial transactions, it was almost 10 years ago that I tried, during the previous Belgian Presidency of the Council, to simply raise the issue for debate. We were unable to debate it. There was virtual unanimity amongst the Belgians on this issue. It was the only issue on which unanimity was obtained. This time, the debate has really taken off. I am aware that a number of forceful requests have been made for concrete proposals to be presented on rates, the tax base and the use of receipts. We should perhaps first allow ideas to evolve in a few Member States so that we can really start a debate on practical arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are not going to do, as part of our preparations for the G20, is to refer this issue back to the G20. Rather, we are going to try and identify a number of partners – and they do exist – with which we can move in the same direction. However, I would stress that this debate is going to be actively pursued. It has already been developed at this ECOFIN. We will resume it at the end of the month at the informal ECOFIN meeting, and I should really like us to be able to make progress, including on the allocation of resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us make no mistake: the aim is not to solve crises through the use of this tax. The aim is perhaps, as many have indicated, to combat speculation. It is also to release funds, and we are already using them three or four times over: firstly, to fight climate change, secondly, for development aid, and thirdly, to fill the holes in the budgets. This debate will not be easy, and I acknowledge that we are a long way from reaching an agreement on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to finish, Madam President, with budgetary consolidation. Let us make no mistake: the European Semester is just one stage. There will be others, and we will be discussing sanctions. The policy just adopted entails debating these mechanisms for the Member States of the euro area to begin with, perhaps, and then seeing how we can extend them, in accordance with the current provisions in the treaties, to Member States that are not in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the idea is to move towards macro-economic convergence and budget consolidation, but I should like to remind you that the pact which binds us in budgetary matters is a Stability and Growth Pact, and that the debate on growth, employment and the social and environmental policies to be conducted in Europe will not be overlooked either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This entire budgetary debate is not simply a debate about restoring equilibrium in our various States. It is about seeing which aspect of our budgets will enable us to move not only towards equilibrium but also towards growth, job creation, the development of social policies and active participation – and I stress the word ‘active’ – in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are going to try and do all this. The Belgian Presidency is obviously ready to make progress on these various issues and, as I said just now, we will be doing that once again this afternoon with regard to investment funds.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Yesterday, the Ecofin Council made two correct decisions which correspond to views that the majority in Parliament have held for months. The first decision was on the macro-prudential supervision of the financial system, under the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), along with the micro-prudential supervision of banks, insurers and pension funds, and control of real estate values. The second decision was on the ‘European Semester’ as a coordination process for European economic policy. As well as ex-ante analysis of the comparative budgetary development of the Member States, the European Semester should be seen not as an invasion of national budgetary autonomy but as a way of discussing a broader view of the economy. It does this not only from a financial point of view, but especially by encompassing employment and social inclusion policy. We share this broader vision, and would like to see it developed in the next stages of economic governance.</p>

The financial markets have been working across international borders for decades, which is why the financial authorities must finally start to operate on a cross-border basis themselves.

      <p sl="el">The debate on the statements by the President of the Commission and the Council on the ECOFIN decisions proves that the entire political face of capital is reflected in the strategic choice of the monopolies to shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to the working and grassroots classes. Injections of artificial optimism are contradicted by the Commission’s own figures, which show the capitalist recovery to be feeble, unstable and uncertain. That is why the brutal anti-grassroots attack is being stepped up with additional means and mechanisms: so-called ‘enhanced economic governance’, the ‘European Semester’ for stricter compliance by the Member States with the Stability Pact, faster and more effective promotion of the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy, changes to the EU budget and close monitoring of the Member States’ budgets to ensure the uniform application of drastic cuts in social spending. Nonsense about creating European authorities to supposedly control credit and tax banks and stock exchange trades are fireworks to mislead the grassroots movement and increasing grassroots resistance. The plans prove once again that the anti-labour war which has been unleashed in Greece by the PASOK Government and the EU and other parties of capital is not specific to Greece; it is the strategic choice of capital for the whole of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (06106/1/2010 – C7-0147/2010 – 2008/0211(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Jeggle) (A7-0230/2010).</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, after almost two years of intensive discussions, we have come to an agreement with the Council and the Commission on a directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. We have achieved a noteworthy balance between the interests of animal welfare and those of research.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone involved for their excellent cooperation in this area. I would also like to thank our former colleague, Neil Parish, who was able to establish a good starting position for Parliament during the first reading in May of last year. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the representatives of the Commission and of the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies. Not least, I also want to thank the staff of the political groups and of the committee secretariat. We have all done everything in our power to achieve this compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Compared with the existing directive, which dates back to 1986, this new animal experiments directive represents a quantum leap in animal welfare. Medical research using animals will still be possible if there are no alternatives, but it will be subject to very strict regulations. The principles behind the new directive are to replace and reduce animal testing and to refine animal welfare. The directive lays down comprehensive protection regulations and control criteria for the purpose of improving welfare. By introducing the obligation to carry out an ethical evaluation, which includes a harm-benefit analysis, and the authorisation process for projects, and by standardising and guaranteeing the competence of the people who work with animals, we are putting in place new and fundamental cornerstones.</p>
      <p sl="de">Experiments in which animals are used may not be carried out without advance authorisation. This includes an assessment of the project on the basis of ethical considerations. Detailed evaluations must be carried out to determine whether a specific animal experiment is needed, whether it can be replaced by an alternative procedure and whether all the animal welfare requirements concerning the severity of the test have been taken into consideration. Wherever possible, researchers must avoid causing distress, suffering and pain to animals.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, at the insistence of the delegation from Parliament, we have been successful in calling for a very strict control and inspection system. The competent authority will adjust the frequency of the inspections, which include unannounced on-site checks, to match the expected level of risk. I am certain that we have managed to find a balance between high levels of animal welfare and the possibility of continuing to carry out research in Europe. This balance takes into account the requirements of research in relation to human dignity and health, does not ignore the legitimate interests of sick people, and introduces a quantum improvement in animal welfare, compared with the standard set in 1986.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the trialogue negotiations, we reached a compromise which was accepted on 3 June 2010. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to support this compromise and to reject all the proposed amendments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would like to express Commissioner Potočnik’s disappointment at not being able to be here today. He is presently in Ghent, participating at the informal ministerial meeting on the EU position for the 10th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is to take place this October in Nagoya.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to thank Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs, Ms Elisabeth Jeggle and former MEP, Mr Neil Parish, the shadows and all those who have worked equally hard in the preparation of this very important piece of legislation. I am delighted to be able to note the excellent collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiation between the institutions and the consultations before and during the codecision procedure proved to be challenging, as the diverse and often sharply divergent views and needs of Member States, industry, academia and animal welfare advocates had to be taken into account and reflected as far as possible in the text. I believe that the result constitutes a fair and workable piece of legislation which successfully strikes a balance between promoting European research and competitiveness and also ensuring that full regard is paid to animal welfare.</p>
      <p sl="en">The revision was much needed as it was vital to significantly improve conditions for experimental animals, clarify the legal obligations and ensure a level playing field within the EU. Once the new legislation is implemented, the European Union will be able to lay claim to having the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world, lifting the bar throughout the 27 Member States of the European Union in a manner that will not compromise, but foster, the competitiveness of our research and industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider that the text put to your vote today retains all the key elements of the Commission’s original proposal. I therefore believe that if your vote is positive, then the Commission’s ambitious objectives for this revision will have been achieved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all animals need our protection, regardless of whether they are used in animal experiments or for agricultural purposes, are kept as pets or live in the wild.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as far as my value system is concerned, an animal is an animal and a person is a person. There is a clear hierarchy of values. For example, over the last few days, we have discussed the fact that it would now apparently be possible to carry out experiments on animals without anaesthetising them first. It is true to say that you can take a blood sample from an animal without sedating it. However, the same applies to people. I do not believe that any of us has ever been sedated before giving a blood sample. The advances made in the field of medicine are of great benefit to mankind and, therefore, animal experiments are unfortunately necessary. In the case of many illnesses, some of which occur very seldom, we are longing for progress to be made in the fields of medicine, science and research. Animal experiments will continue to be needed in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of animal experiments not being used when other equivalent methods are available. The proposal that we have in front of us guarantees this, with one exception, which is that neither people nor human reproductive cells should be used in these alternative methods.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have reached a good compromise which provides protection for research, for Europe as a research location and, above all, for animals. We should vote in favour of this compromise today to ensure that there is greater protection for animals and for valuable research in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to begin by thanking both Mrs Jeggle and our other fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs, for the good cooperation we have enjoyed during the negotiations conducted with the Council in order to reach this compromise.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Approximately 12 million animals are used in scientific experiments every year in the European Union. The need to provide them with better protection has been frequently raised as an issue by the general public.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If it were possible, we would all like to stop animal testing. However, we still need to use them to protect the health of humans and animals, and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The new provisions added to this directive include the obligation for much more frequent inspections than in the past, without the need to give any prior notice for a large number of them. Prior authorisation is also required for procedures using animals, especially non-human primates.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In fact, a limit has been set on the suffering which an animal involved in scientific procedures can be subjected to and a restriction has been proposed on the use of non-human primates. This means that they can now only be used in procedures aimed at avoiding, preventing, diagnosing and treating illnesses which are potentially fatal to man.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am pleased that the final text retained the obligation to carry out a regular review of the directive, taking into account the scientific advances made. I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting alternative methods to animal testing, specified in this draft directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are all aware that the current legislative proposal has been on the cards for a very long time. I believe that, following the negotiations conducted with the Council during the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies, we have achieved a balanced common position which meets both the need to protect animals used in scientific procedures and the needs of the scientific community.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I shall try to give you a little of the historical background. Firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle for her exceptional leadership in this very difficult matter.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We took over the work on a matter in which, to put it briefly, the Commission’s proposal could almost be described as extremely animal friendly and Parliament’s first reading could, to the same extent, be described as extremely industry friendly. Over recent years, with excellent support from the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies, Parliament, under the leadership of Mrs Jeggle, the Commission, the Council, our party groups and the committee officials, have worked our way through it, bit by bit, word by word, to what is now a reasonably balanced directive.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If it is, first and foremost, the animals that we want to protect, then personally I would like to direct attention to the structures that we are currently constructing for the animals that we are eating. In this regard, we have an enormous amount of work to do. As things stand, these animals have a poorer level of protection than animals used in experiments. Look at the long transport routes to slaughter in Europe. Do you not see them when you are on the motorway?</p>
      <p sl="sv">I have been involved with difficult reports and in difficult negotiations before, but I have never actually seen Parliament shift its opinions and decisions according to the position of the particular lobby groups present. I would not have expected that of this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like to thank Mrs Jeggle for her hard work on this report. There are significant improvements in the compromise text, particularly on inspections, on the new authorisation process for experiments and on a proper classification system, which we welcome. However, we have been waiting several years for the update of this law, and my group still has three major areas of concern, which is why we submitted the amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe Member States should keep the right to introduce stricter rules on animal protection, as they have at the moment and as we agreed at first reading. We believe that alternatives to animals must be used wherever that is possible. The current wording limits the mandatory alternative requirement to a minority of tests carried out, which weakens existing laws and, again, is not what we voted for in the first reading.</p>
      <p sl="en">On non-human primates, we believe that, without the word ‘substantial’ to define it, a debilitating condition could be interpreted as almost any human ailment rather than as a serious reduction in human health, which is what the intention is here.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know from experience with legislation in this field that implementation and enforcement are key to achieving effective legislation, and these issues are crucial ones. With the aim of achieving clarity through further discussion, my group will be calling for a referral back to committee.</p>

It is good that the European Union is regulating another important area concerning the treatment of animals and that we are adopting solutions which are intended to prevent cruelty towards them. In the previous system of essential experiments conducted on animals, there was much cruelty. This can be reduced, and this directive moves in this direction. Cruelty to animals harms animals and causes their suffering, but most of all, it strikes at man. It is an affront to human dignity. Those who are cruel to animals act against their own humanity and their own dignity. It is good that the resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in this direction. It does contain one provision about which I have some reservations, but I will talk about this in my statement after the vote.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Europe has an obligation to promote the protection of animals, but what is under discussion here goes far beyond this premise and poses us some difficult questions. No belief should be viewed as having an absolute value in itself. We are, however, in the midst of choices and contradictions, and these can only be resolved by balanced legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On a scale of values, should animal well-being be ranked below the value of human health or not? What is the actual European research strategy where human health and basic research are at stake, for example? How can we prevent the abolition of European medical research, as this could ultimately lead to its destruction?</p>
      <p sl="pt">By eliminating these issues, we might salve our European conscience, but we are transferring research into medicine, for example, to other countries where there may be no monitoring of animal welfare.

New scientific knowledge means that alternatives can be promoted to replace or reduce the use of animals. Methods or procedures must be used that cause as little pain and suffering as possible, but without impeding scientific research designed to fight diseases.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore right to review Europe’s animal protection legislation in order to achieve satisfactory results that both meet the demands of the research industry, given the need to pursue scientific research that benefits human health, and, at the same time, look after the welfare of those animals still needed for scientific purposes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a new and important step forward in the field of animal welfare by providing more protection for animals used in scientific research.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard a great deal about animal welfare. We have also heard that Europe is an important location for industrial research and innovation. However, there is one issue which we have not talked about enough. This concerns a fundamental value of the European Union, namely human dignity, and the question of how we handle it. I believe that we must not, on the one hand, improve animal welfare and, on the other, expose ourselves to risks in an area which, at least in part, runs counter to our European values.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why am I saying this? The European Commission has referred to alternative methods in its documents. These include five methods relating to research into and use of embryonic stem cells and, in particular, human stem cells. In my opinion, this is immoral. It is something which I cannot ignore when it comes to voting today on the proposed compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Therefore, I would like to call on you and, in particular, on the Council, the Member States and the Commission, in the form of the so-called Regulatory Committee, to take a highly sensitive approach. When we show concern for human dignity, this does not mean that we are opposed to animal welfare. On the contrary, we want both of these things. We want to cooperate to protect the dignity of living creatures, whether they are animals or humans, in a way that corresponds to our European concept of dignity, so that we can work together to defend and support it.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of Europe’s trademarks is that we are prepared to fight for human freedom and dignity. For this reason, I will not be able to take part in today’s vote, because in moral terms, it is not possible for me to do one thing and ignore another. Discussing this subject today was the right thing to do, but the third dimension of human dignity has come off rather badly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are clearly strong views on both sides of this argument. The argument is quite clear. It is about those who believe that the rights of animals should take precedence and those of us who believe in the rights of society to see progress in the development of medicines, treatments and cures for the infirm, the ill and those who are suffering. We need to get that balance right. Yes, we need to protect animals, but we need to make sure that our scientists have the tools to be able to develop the new medicines that will provide cures in the future for some of the most desperate diseases that we face as a society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that in this argument, the text in front of us gets the balance right between these two points of view.

There is a tradition, a false belief in the effectiveness of animal experiments. More and more medicines involve human-specific reactions and, for this, animal experiments are completely worthless. The alternatives, however, are effective, as well as quicker and cheaper. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance aim to help the animals and research, so I recommend that you vote for them instead.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Moreover, there is a loophole that allows the use of monkeys. We should close this loophole with the amendments proposed by the Greens. Monkeys can only be accepted in the worst case scenario for serious human disease symptoms – there are no loopholes there.</p>

      <p sl="en">In Europe, we already have the highest animal welfare standards in the world and this directive will raise those standards even further. That is very commendable. Nonetheless, we must bear in mind that human beings and their prosperity mean more than the well-being of animals, and that there is a fundamental difference in dignity between animals and human beings.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the balance between stricter rules on animal welfare and the use of animals, while still allowing research under strict conditions. I support the ‘three Rs’ principle: replace animal tests whenever possible with other methods; reduce the number of animals used to a minimum; and refine standards for breeding, accommodation and care.</p>
      <p sl="en">Animal tests will only be allowed when no alternative method is available. At the same time, medical research will still be possible. That will provide a balance between the ethical necessity of the reduction of animal testing and the requirements of modern medical research.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, I would like to strongly oppose alternative methods to animal testing that might include tests based on the use of human embryonic stem cells. I am concerned about those Member States whose domestic laws do not explicitly exclude from compulsory alternative testing those methods which involve the use of human embryos. When this directive comes into force, Member States might be obliged to ensure that these alternative methods are applied, whether or not they are based on stem cells from embryos.</p>

The position represented by Mrs Jeggle today centres upon of a ranking of values that seems well balanced between the benefits for human health and the suffering of animals. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will therefore vote in favour of the report and reject any amendments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to and respect for Mrs Jeggle, who has been working on this report for years. However, Mrs Jeggle, there is one thing that I must say. As Europeans, we cannot take pride in this report. It is too vague and it permits too many things which a country or a continent that plays a leading role in animal welfare throughout the world should not allow.</p>
      <p sl="de">I foresee a worsening of the situation, in particular, as far as the reuse of experimental animals is concerned. Previously, this was more difficult, but I believe that the regulations have now been watered down. You are shaking your head, but it is true that when you look at this carefully, the small print and the nuances in the wording are the things that make the difference. The severity of the tests is also an area where, in many Member States, things are likely to get worse. Some Member States, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden, had already gone further than this. We have introduced a pain threshold and the Council has watered it down by permitting exceptions. In addition, the power of the Commission has been reduced with regard to inspections.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, I will be voting in favour of this report, Mrs Jeggle, because it represents an improvement on the 1986 directive, which is now 24 years old. The authorisation mechanisms are in place. A licence is needed in advance for three stages of testing, which is a good thing. The procedures have been simplified, which is also a positive step. Personally, I am proud of the fact that we have been able to rescue the subject of alternative test methods from the last parliamentary term. However, we will need to provide more funding for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">This directive will have to be revised within the next seven years. It represents quite a good foundation, but in seven years, we will need to improve it so that we can live up to our reputation here in Europe for having the highest levels of animal welfare in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the report being presented in this Chamber today comes from our fellow Member, Mrs Jeggle. It is aimed at finalising a process that has been as long as it has complicated, and has only been possible through hard work and skilled dialogue, and so we would like to thank her for it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whenever the matter under consideration involves not only multiple interests but also moral values, it triggers not only solid, rational arguments but also an emotional response. This does not help to achieve the consensus that we are hoping for here, in order to serve the European public while respecting the views of the various political groups and Member States. This would allow us to contribute to European integration through the preparation and presentation of common standards. It is precisely this hoped-for standardisation of criteria that is at issue in this report, in an approach that assumes a higher level of protection for animal life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This has meant that over the two years following the decision to revise Council Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and acknowledging the disparities between Member States in this regard, there has been an attempt to establish more detailed rules on this matter, with the aim of reducing procedural disparities. In doing so, it was important to balance a greater level of protection for animals used for scientific purposes with the need to safeguard the necessary conditions for biomedical research, which allow it to develop within the European Union. This balance has been achieved in the text which we are to vote upon shortly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This will benefit the animals under our protection, and it fulfils our human responsibilities towards animals without compromising the quality and progress of biomedical research which helps us all, every day.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this report on the animal experiments directive. In its negotiations with the Commission and the Council, Parliament has achieved a great deal: namely replacement, reduction and refinement.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true that from an animal welfare perspective, we are still doing too little. However, the Council was not prepared to do more and has made it clear that there would be no new directive if we did not accept these results. This does not mean that we cannot continue to make progress in this area in future. Animal welfare and research must be given high priority in our policies. I would be very happy if we were able to stop animal experiments completely today. Unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving this goal and, therefore, we must ensure that we provide animals with as much protection as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The compromise that has been negotiated offers a far better foundation for doing this. The only important thing is to make sure that all the Member States implement the new directive consistently. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs warmly for their hard work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur and those who have worked with her have certainly done a difficult job, for which we thank them.</p>
      <p sl="it">Personally, however, I cannot hide the fact that along with several members of the Italian Government, which I support, I am puzzled about an issue that, even after 24 years, still does not appear to have been sorted out as we would have liked it to be.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some Members have pointed out that animal sensitivities are different to those of human beings. Indeed, no animal would ever do what is happening, what has already happened and what is yet to happen in Iran. In general, animals do not torture, stone to death or tell those lies that are so typical of our own political world.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must rightly call for these animals to be useful to us in advancing scientific research and improving human health, but we do not have the right to call for them to continue to be subject to useless, repetitive experiments that only serve to line the pockets of some so-called researcher.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are very well aware that in vitro experiments or computer simulations of human metabolism make it possible to achieve more accurate results today than can be achieved by animal experiments, because the results of an experiment often cannot be extrapolated from one species to another, either between animals or from an animal to human beings.</p>
      <p sl="it">For these reasons, we hope that this directive will be revised to be more in tune with current trends and mutual respect.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the result they have achieved. I think we have obtained the best possible compromise between the needs of research and ensuring the welfare of animals used for scientific purposes.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, animal-based research is still essential since no alternatives exist. Computer simulations and cell cultures are not enough, and it is not politicians that say this, but researchers. I should like to remind the House that cures for some very serious diseases have been developed precisely because of tests carried out on live animals. Ninety-eight per cent of these animals are rodents, which means that larger species are used only to a very minor extent. I must also point out that it is thanks to these tests that today we have cures for leukaemia, diabetes and some kinds of tumour. Lastly, I would point out that researchers are the first to want to avoid unnecessary suffering, and I think one just has to see them at work to realise that.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that there are still some sections that cause concern. I should like to refer to one that has not yet been mentioned: in Article 49, all reference to ethics committees has disappeared and has been replaced with the more generic national committees for the protection of animals. That has rung some alarm bells among those working in the area, because ethics committees already exist in many laboratories and others are being set up. There is a fear, therefore, that these committees may somehow have their role diminished, and they may even be replaced by more general committees that are less well prepared both ethically and scientifically.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The current situation in fact allows for human material to be used to protect animals during necessary experimentation. We always talk about compromise, and the result of this culture of compromise is that we no longer know what is ethically acceptable and what is not. However, there are some ethical issues for which no compromise is possible. If the Commission and the Council cannot guarantee this ban, it will be factual evidence of how the EU treats human beings.</p>

      <p sl="de">Therefore, I see this report as a highly successful attempt to bring about a balance between animal welfare and human healthcare provision.

This is why we must support the excellent compromise reached by Mrs Jeggle, from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Of course, it is true that the research lobby exerted a great deal of pressure. We were all aware of that. However, have we achieved our main objective, which is a reduction in the number of animal experiments? There is still a big question mark over this. The other problem is, of course, that the use of non-human primates has not actually been reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance find it most disturbing, and we also believe it is a serious violation of European principles, that the Member States will not be permitted to put in place regulations which are stricter than those in the existing legislation.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the development of techniques and methods which dispense with the need for experimenting on animals and which minimise the suffering inflicted on animals, in cases where this is necessary, should be an important objective of scientific research, and the experimental and technological development that it is important to stimulate. Apart from such development, the need to disseminate these techniques and methods should be taken into account, along with their uptake by research and development institutions, and national scientific and technological systems with various levels of development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union must take on an important role in this field by promoting cooperation between the scientific and technological institutions and systems in different countries, including third countries. We believe – in this field as in others, naturally – that the establishment of common minimum levels of protection in legislation should not prevent an individual Member State from adopting higher levels of protection if it so wishes.</p>

However, it is a little paradoxical, as I am in fact opposed to animal experiments. Alternative test methods do exist, and fortunately, the revision of the directive includes this area. I am very grateful for that. I hope that greater momentum is given to the development of more alternative test methods. Right here and now, however, the EU must introduce humane and secure rules for animals used in experiments. It is finally being recognised that animals are sentient beings and so we will now introduce pain limits. Why, however, are we not introducing a section prohibiting the use of the same animals again and again? Why are we not prohibiting the use of monkeys in brain research? It makes me angry that we take so much more account of the interests of interested organisations than we do of animal welfare. I also find it frustrating that we are only able to legislate for the EU in this House, because how are animal experiments dealt with outside the EU?</p>

This report represents another important step towards improving animal welfare even further. Our joint objective is to restrict animal experiments and to improve the living conditions for animals used for research purposes. I welcome the fact that animal experiments will be replaced by other methods wherever possible and that the standards for breeding, housing and caring for these animals will be improved. However, I would like to look back to some of the experiences of the agricultural sector and to express my criticism of some of the points in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not assume that more red tape in the field of research will improve animal welfare. Research and the related downstream economic sectors in Europe must not be put at a disadvantage internationally and when compared with other industries. It is true that both here and in the agricultural industry, when society calls for higher standards of animal welfare, we need to consider the standards which apply to imported products. The high European quality and animal welfare standards must receive adequate recognition with regard to fair competition.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you for your comments and the general support for the provisions included in this directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have before us an ambitious directive that, if adopted, will significantly improve animal welfare in the EU. I agree with Ms Sârbu that full and faithful implementation will be key for the directive to fulfil its potential. That challenge is just beginning. Today, we can be satisfied that a good compromise has been reached on a difficult but important file, and that a big step forward can be made on improving the lives of animals still needed in scientific procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now give my reactions to some of the comments that were made this morning. Regarding the comments made by Ms Evans, it has to be realised that this directive provides further legal clarity to today’s situation. In addition, in basic and applied research for which no EU methods are prescribed, Article 4 is very clear in requiring the use of alternative methods wherever possible. Therefore, the requirement to use alternative methods is not weakened; on the contrary, it is further strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the comments made by Mr Kastler and Mr Mikolášik about human embryonic stem cells, this matter was not disregarded in the discussions. It was discussed at length during the negotiations, and the solutions found reflect the fact that there is no consensus in the EU as to whether human embryonic stem cells should be used. The Commission therefore believes this is best regulated at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreed text answers these concerns by leaving the decision on whether to allow their use to each individual Member State. It must be added that, in Member States where there is no explicit legislation prohibiting the use of embryonic stem cells, the use of such a testing method would only be obligatory under the revised directive if this testing method were recognised by EU legislation. No legislation of this kind exists at EU level, and any such legislation would require Member States to agree to its being passed.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the ethical evaluation mentioned by Ms Gardini, the concept of ethical evaluation and the committee carrying it out remain firmly in Article 38. However, the word ‘ethical’ had to be removed during the Council discussions. The full requirement remains.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that, with your vote, you will send a strong signal that the European Parliament stands behind the outcome negotiated by the institutions under the skilful leadership of Ms Jeggle and the Swedish Presidency. Today, we have the chance to bring the EU to the forefront in combining a high level of animal welfare with quality science.

      <p sl="de">Mr Häusling, if we reject this report now, the directive from 1986 will continue to apply for a long time, which will not improve the situation of laboratory animals. We will not be able to introduce any new legislation in the near future. The amendments which you have once again submitted were rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. There was no support for your amendments. You have now tabled them again. It is your right to do so and I respect that right.</p>
      <p sl="de">What use is the highest standard of animal welfare in the European Union if we cannot implement the same standard throughout the world? The important thing for us all to do now is to ensure that the legislation which we will hopefully be adopting later today is implemented in the Member States over the next few years. That is a challenge for us. Firstly, we must make sure that all the Member States reach the same high standard in this area. That is our first task and we should not already be calling for individual Member States to implement higher standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where there are already higher standards, and I am speaking here as a German about Germany, these standards will remain in place. We are not asking some states to take a step backwards. On the contrary, we respect the sovereignty of the Member States, in the same way as we do in the case of research using embryonic stem cells. This is the right thing for us to do and it is an important point.</p>

However, I am at the same time unhappy about the fact that it was not possible to include all invertebrates within the scope of the directive in the final draft. The European Parliament requested that the scope of the directive at least include those species of invertebrates that have been scientifically shown to have the potential for registering pain, distress, fear and lasting harm. The draft does not even mention this request. Although I acknowledge the need to use animals for scientific research, I firmly believe that the directive should have gone further and included within its scope all creatures without exception. Let us not forget that our understanding is still expanding the range of creatures in respect of which official scientific bodies acknowledge the ability to feel pain, distress and fear and to suffer lasting harm. We can therefore deduce that the ability to feel fear, distress and pain is distributed throughout the animal kingdom. The acknowledgement of this fact is a matter more of morality than science. We have unfortunately demonstrated through the adopted compromise that European culture has yet to rid itself of the Cartesian concept of an animal as a thing, and that we still have a long way to go in this respect.</p>

I would now like to use this opportunity to make clear my fundamental opposition to the consent given in the directive to the use of embryonic stem cells as an alternative to experiments on animals for scientific purposes. This is the outworking of an erroneous anthropology, which allows the possibility of destroying human life in the earliest phase of its development in order to improve the welfare of animals. The guarantees proposed by the European Parliament at first reading were much more explicit in this respect. The ambiguous provisions of the directive constitute a real threat to existing law in countries such as Germany, where embryos enjoy a degree of protection. The fact that these research methods have not been ruled out is an outright imposition of their legality in countries such as Poland, Ireland and Malta.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me, once more, the opportunity to address with you the issue of the ACTA negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, let me recall the context of these negotiations: ACTA is an agreement which will be important to safeguard the EU’s competitiveness and jobs on the world market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, if we want to remain a competitive economy, we will have to rely on innovation, creativity and brand exclusivity. These are some of our main comparative advantages on the world market. So we need the tools to ensure that they are adequately protected in our main export markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">And this is about issues of concern to EU citizens: not only jobs, but also consumer safety, security and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are aiming at is simply setting an international standard in IPR enforcement that is reasonable, balanced and effective, and thus goes beyond the current WTO rules on IPR: the TRIPS agreement. This is the ultimate objective, on which I am sure we all agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last March, I came here to outline the key principles on which the Commission’s participation in these negotiations is based, and committed myself to enhance transparency vis-à-vis Parliament on these negotiations. As you can see from the draft texts resulting from the negotiations held since March, which we have shared with you, the Commission has kept its word and has consistently stuck to these principles. Let me recall to you these principles:</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the objective of ACTA is to address large-scale infringements of intellectual property rights which have a significant commercial impact, and it is not about checking on the content of travellers’ laptops or computers. It will not lead to limitation of civil liberties or harassment of consumers. If some of you have doubts on this, I would be very happy to hear your arguments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, ACTA is only about enforcement of existing intellectual property rights. It will not include provisions modifying substantive intellectual property law. It should set minimum rules on how innovators can enforce their rights in courts, at the borders or over the Internet. For example, ACTA will ensure that European fashion designers, artists or automobile manufacturers can see their rights adequately safeguarded when confronted with counterfeiting of their creations outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, ACTA must remain in line with the EU acquis, including the current level of harmonisation of IPR enforcement, the E-Commerce Directive, the Regulatory Telecom Framework, and, last but not least, the applicable EU legislation on data protection and privacy. ACTA will not change any EU legislation through the back door. So what then, you will ask me, is the added value? The answer is that our legislation is one of the most effective, and that if other countries adopt it, it will help our innovators.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, we will make sure that ACTA does not hamper access to generic medicines. There is now clear language in the draft text ensuring that ACTA will not serve as a basis to interfere with the trade in generic medicines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, ACTA will be consistent with the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health of 2001, whilst the obligations on border controls, which is the most sensitive issue as regards access to medicines, will not apply to patents.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards transparency, we have kept our word to debrief the European Parliament, through dedicated sessions, after each negotiation round, and we will continue to do so. And in line with our commitments under the Framework Agreement, we have, of course, shared the draft texts with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also take this opportunity to briefly report the results of the 10th round of ACTA negotiations that took place in Washington between 16 and 20 August 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the civil, customs and penal chapters, the Parties made some progress, but there was not yet sufficient flexibility by the Parties to address some of the more delicate issues. There was also extensive work on the general and horizontal chapters (preamble, general provisions, definitions, enforcement practices, international cooperation and institutional provisions) which are almost concluded.</p>
      <p sl="en">But regrettably, in the last two rounds, it has been made increasingly clear that a consensus including all the current ACTA parties will only be reached on the basis of the lowest common denominator, given the variety of views and practices on this issue with the various ACTA participants. This will be at the expense of the level of ambition – and effectiveness – of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the digital environment (Internet), which is one of the most sensitive but also the most ‘innovative’ chapters of ACTA, there was a considerable step back in the last round, with the Parties unable to agree on a common liability exemption regime for Internet service providers.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is also the case with the very important chapter on customs measures, where several Parties oppose carrying out checks on exports and transit of infringing goods, thus failing to react against the widespread international traffic in counterfeits.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another area where discussions are disappointing for EU interests relates to which intellectual property rights will be covered by the agreement. The EU has a wide and diversified basis of right holders. A farmer producing products with geographical indications, or a textile company creating designs, are also victims of counterfeiting and also need to be covered by better enforcement rules. The problem is that several of our partners insist that only copyright and trademarks ‘deserve’ to be included in ACTA. We strongly disagree and will continue to firmly push for these offensive EU interests to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next round will take place in Tokyo at the end of the month (from 23 September until 1 October 2010). It seems that we are approaching the end game and the Parties are committed to resolving remaining substantive issues at the Tokyo Round.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain firmly convinced of the importance of tackling the systematic and widespread abuse of European intellectual property around the world, and of the essential contribution that ACTA can make towards this goal. This is why I remain committed to the success of these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, if, at the end of the process, the EU is faced with a treaty without much concrete added value for our right holders, or with a treaty trying to establish that there are 1st and 2nd category intellectual property rights, we should be ready to reconsider our participation in the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2008, 178 million articles were seized by EU customs officials. Of these, 20 million items were dangerous. A total of 54% of the counterfeit products came from China and India was the main culprit as far as medicines were concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Counterfeit goods cause a great deal of damage to the European economy, but the people who buy fake products are also hard hit. I am thinking of medicines, for example. It would be a nightmare for me and for all parents if a sick child were to die after being given medicine, simply because we are not able to prevent fake products and medicines from coming onto the market. We must solve this problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Product piracy is a central issue for the European Union. We must protect industries and consumers throughout the world against products which can cause damage to health and result in financial losses for companies. Therefore, I welcome the negotiations on an Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) as a major step in the right direction in the fight against product piracy. We know that this agreement is not the only solution to pirating, but it is the first international agreement in this area which involves some states taking up the struggle against product piracy. I would like to see as many other states as possible joining in.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our group welcomes the positive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament since our resolution in the spring. We regret the fact that we had to go as far as adopting this resolution. However, as a result of regular reports from the Commission, we were able to gain an overview of the negotiations over recent months. I would like to congratulate the negotiators on their latest achievements. It is increasingly difficult even for the critics of ACTA to find negative points in the agreement. The issue of border control measures in the case of patent infringements and, therefore, the concern about the trade in generic medicines, have been removed. Three strikes and the searching of private luggage have been removed. The compulsory liability of Internet service providers has also been removed and the agreement seems to comply with the acquis communautaire. I think we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to call on the Commission to maintain its strong position so that it can represent the interests of the European Union. I support the proposal to include patent rights, geographical designations of origin and patent infringements in the section of the agreement relating to civil law. I am very much of the opinion that Parma ham, Tiroler Almkäse and champagne deserve the same level of protection as Coca-Cola or Kellogg’s Corn Flakes. Therefore, I am calling on the USA to stop blocking the publication of the documents. Publishing the documents after the New Zealand round has demonstrated how important transparency is and has enabled a great deal of the criticism of the agreement to be silenced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask the Commission to continue to support the publication of the negotiation documents, at the latest before the agreement is signed. I wish the Commission every success during the next round in Japan and I hope for further timely and detailed reports on the negotiations. After the negotiations have come to an end, our group will sit down in peace and quiet to evaluate the results on the basis of the final text and then decide on its position with regard to ratification. I wish the negotiators success.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have just said some reassuring things, but I still do not think that the concerns shared by a large number of Members about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completely dispelled.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Back in March, I proposed a resolution, which was passed by a large majority in this Chamber, and which made it possible to publish the negotiating text. During the debate, we called for the acquis communautaire – which you have referred to – the safety and supply of generic medicines to be guaranteed and the fundamental freedoms of our fellow citizens to be respected. We also referred to geographical indications, and we did so in order to tell you our priorities, which I am going to keep on repeating to you so that the position which you will defend in a few weeks’ time in Japan is based on the parliamentary debate which we have managed to initiate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yesterday, during the debate on the State of the Union, many speakers quite rightly pointed out that we MEPs are the spokespeople for our fellow citizens and that, without this link, the Commission is in danger of engaging in a sterile confrontation with Parliament. I am therefore asking you, Commissioner, to consider, as a priority, that the MEPs before you are first and foremost your partners and are not here to simply contradict you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The partnership we want is not one in which we are bound, as your services sometimes seem to want, by a vow of secrecy. Your services have just answered our questions behind closed doors. We are given the latest version of the ACTA text but we are prohibited from sending any messages when we leave these meetings or after we have read the agreement, whereas our role is to alert, explain and ensure things are understood. This is therefore my second request for you to regard the transparency of debates as an element which enriches your deliberations rather than as a breakdown of trust.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to these two main issues, and because I am starting to become accustomed to this type of exercise, I am going to inform you of my concerns. First of all, there is access to medicines. This has been mentioned. You tell us that protecting access is one of your priorities, that you are doing everything possible to ensure that nothing in this agreement hinders their manufacture or free movement. At this point, however, I would ask you about patents. Why do you want to include them in this agreement? The desire to step up the legitimate fight against counterfeiting should not be a pretext for using ACTA as a means of extending the rights of patentees way beyond what is set out in the TRIPS agreement. Please do not confuse generic medicines with counterfeit medicines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another important point is safeguards. Texts cannot be too rigorous in ensuring a true balance between the rights of users and those of rights holders. I refer you to the various formulations contained in the TRIPS agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome your comments about the Internet and I have great confidence in the idea that ACTA will not serve to weaken the EU position clearly expressed in the E-Commerce Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, there are definitely other issues I should raise this morning, but the first duty I am setting myself is to ensure that, thanks to this debate, we are able to provide as much information as possible on this agreement to all our fellow citizens, and to tell you that the key element for me is the protection of their rights and their fundamental freedoms. This is why I expect you to bear in mind the points raised by Members and to defend them during the negotiations. I also call on you to honour your commitment to publish the text as soon as the negotiations have been completed, whether this is at the end of the round in Japan or at a subsequent stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The public debate will have to take place, for example, in this Chamber. I shall therefore ask for a resolution, and we expect you to take our point of view into account before any signing of ACTA takes place, even if this means returning to the negotiating table.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘acta est fabula, plaudite!’ – ‘the play is over, applaud!’ – as Roman actors used to say at the end of a performance. The play is over and perhaps we are on the eve of its conclusion, although it may not yet be time to applaud.</p>
      <p sl="it">During this debate, we have been given important reassurances by Mr De Gucht, but we know that 64% of counterfeit goods come from China, which is not a party to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). We will therefore need to assess whether it is all worthwhile – in other words, whether we ought to sign the agreement if it does not bring any real benefits, as the Commissioner concluded. There are not many causes of concern remaining, but they are significant. A lot has been said about the Internet, and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts, but we remain vigilant.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards access to medicines, I repeat what has already been demanded by other Members: there can be no lumping together of counterfeit medicines on the one hand and generic medicines on the other. It is vital to allow access to medicines at competitive prices, which are crucial for patients in developing countries. The question I should like to ask is whether the Doha declaration on the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and public health will be included at least in the preamble of the ACTA text.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, as regards geographical indications, we find ourselves in a potentially paradoxical situation, because registered trademarks that might violate geographical indications would enjoy greater protection than the geographical indications themselves. Here, too, TRIPS provides a sounder basis in many respects, and we therefore call for vigilance and a firm stance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I am pleased that written statement 12 on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) received the required majority of votes yesterday in Parliament. This demonstrates that the European Parliament is continuing to support the clear position which it took in its resolution in March.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, the written statement enhances one important point. We do not want the exercise of intellectual property rights to be outsourced to private companies. The rule of law and the principles of democracy require that any interference with fundamental rights, including on the Internet, comes from legitimate representatives of the state and that the high standards of our constitution, the Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon continue to apply.</p>
      <p sl="de">An agreement which encourages private cartels of rights holders to arrange everything to suit their business interests, as the current ACTA draft does, must not be allowed to come into force. The EU Commission’s behaviour during the ACTA negotiations is verging on a violation of our treaties. Instead of the measures which were criticised by Parliament being removed, the wording of the draft agreement has simply been made even more vague. It looks increasingly unlikely that the acquis communautaire will be complied with.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fortunately, the ongoing protests by the European Parliament now seem to be taking effect. However, if ACTA is to receive a majority of the votes in this House, there is still a lot to be done. This should have become clear to you by yesterday at the latest.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming three things that were said at the beginning: first, that there will be no new intellectual property rights; second, that there will be no changes to legislation via the back door; and, third, the increased transparency we have seen from the Commission, particularly vis-à-vis some of the other negotiating partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to understand the difference between the digital world and the world of atoms. As Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired magazine, once said, in a world of increased bandwidth, cheaper storage and cheaper processing power, digital products tend over time towards free or towards zero. What this means is that many of the industries which are complaining about the digital world have to understand that they must look to new business models. In particular, the phonographic industry and similar industries cannot rely on old business models.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it is a different story in the world of atoms – in the world of the manufacturing of products. We need to make sure that, while the EU may not be competitive in terms of labour costs, EU countries and companies are competitive when it comes to research and design. It must be galling for companies who invest millions – sometimes billions – in new products and new designs to see those products undercut by counterfeit products elsewhere. We lead the world in the field of high-value motor cars and in products like smart phones, and we must be very careful that, after millions or billions are invested in these products, these are not simply undercut.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, protecting inventors and companies from having their ideas stolen is an important issue, in particular, for small and medium-sized businesses. However, I would like to ask once again whether product piracy can really be restricted by a small club of countries signing an agreement, especially as these countries are better known for inventions than for forgeries. In my opinion, these negotiations should be taking place within an international context, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).</p>
      <p sl="de">In general terms, this is all about a new framework and a new commitment. Mr De Gucht, your concluding remarks today are pointing in this direction. I know that the negotiators from the Commission and the Council are aware of this dilemma. Their solution is to give companies comprehensive rights to take legal action in the potential forgers’ sales markets. They want to be able to arrest importers and, according to the draft text, even end customers at the borders, unless individual signatories to the agreement make exceptions. The text states that:</p>
      <p sl="de">“Parties may exclude from border measures small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers' personal luggage”.</p>
      <p sl="de">They want to impose legislation in Europe that will allow a company to request that goods or software products that have been imported from a signatory to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) are impounded or even destroyed by order of the courts. This can, if necessary, happen without the other party being given a hearing. In the case of a container of fake chainsaws, this may sound like a simple procedure. However, the agreement aims to extend this process to cover areas such as software components.</p>
      <p sl="de">Will it be possible for software giants, such as Microsoft, to hunt down and destroy their smaller competitors by means of legal proceedings? The giants of the entertainment industry have also succeeded in having their concerns included in the ACTA negotiations. Legal action will be taken not only against downloading and copying, but also against the production and distribution of technologies which, among other things, allow copy protection to be circumvented.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have said that progress has been made and it is true that the USA has dropped its call for Internet service providers (ISPs) to be held liable. However, in the section of the agreement concerning criminal law, there is still a paragraph on aiding and abetting. In addition, ISPs will be obliged to hand over the personal data of customers who are suspected of violating copyright legislation, following a legitimate request from a company. We have discovered in this House during the course of the SWIFT negotiations that the United States, for example, does not have data protection legislation as we understand it in the European Union. What is the situation in the other countries which are signatories to the agreement? The agreement must not be allowed to interfere with the acquis communautaire. We must be able to protect small and medium-sized companies against patent campaigns by software giants and guarantee that the personal data of Internet users is secure.</p>

      <p sl="it">There is nothing on the Internet and Parliament’s services that I contacted have not replied, because the Commission does not make all the texts available. There is nothing else to do, then, but talk in general terms. Nonetheless, it is useful to address this issue, which forms part of Europe’s plan for the protection of our products and, hence, of our companies and our workers. Even so, there is some resistance, for example, with regard to regulating trademarks and products.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is our duty to protect our workers by checking whether there is any form of unfair competition or competition based on worker exploitation and, in this case, competition based on forgery and counterfeiting.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the planned plurilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) aims to make the fight against product piracy and infringements of copyright more effective by means of international cooperation, coordinating the enforcement of legislation and new laws to protect intellectual property. It goes without saying that we need continued transparency. Measures which will result in the EU Data Protection Directive being watered down or which could even have a negative impact on freedom of expression represent an excessive response to the problem of combating product piracy and infringements of copyright and must not be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament called on the Commission to evaluate the possible effects of the agreement. Unfortunately, this evaluation has not yet been carried out. In my opinion, protecting intellectual property is crucial, but data protection and the protection of privacy are equally important. Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor, said on this subject, and I quote:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘While intellectual property is important to society and must be protected, it should not be placed above individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy, data protection and other rights.’ That is the end of the quotation.

However, there is unfortunately a great deal of ignorance and uncertainty in this area among the general public. I regularly receive e-mails from concerned citizens who complain about the lack of transparency during the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) negotiations and see ACTA as a major invasion of their rights and freedoms. It is important to provide more information in this area and to highlight the fact that the problem is caused not by ACTA, but in part by the acquis communautaire of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">The preliminary ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 19 February 2009 clearly states that Internet service providers can be called to account for infringements of copyright by their customers. Therefore, existing treaties allow for the Internet access of EU citizens to be blocked. The problem lies not with ACTA, but with European Union regulations which could limit the freedoms and rights of EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The idea of a multilateral agreement on the fight against piracy and counterfeiting might constitute an effective mechanism for combating such activities, but I also back those members who have emphasised the need for transparency and greater confidence in these negotiations and agreements.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who have made interventions. This is very valuable information for us a couple of weeks before what will probably be the ‘end game’ in Tokyo, and we will certainly take it into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before speaking about confidentiality, I will answer a couple of technical questions. One was with respect to the TRIPS agreement on public health, and whether this would be explicitly mentioned in the agreement. It is explicitly referred to, as follows: ‘recognising the principles set out in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health adopted on 14 November 2001 by the WTO at the Fourth WTO ministerial conference held in Doha, Qatar’.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were also some questions on privacy. There again, when you look at the text which is currently being discussed, it says ‘nothing in this agreement shall require any party to disclose information (…) which would be contrary to its law or its international agreements, including laws protecting the right of privacy’. Further mention is made in the draft text under discussion to the effect that, with respect to enforcement in digital environments, enforcement procedures shall be implemented in a manner that, ‘consistent with each party’s law, preserves principles relating to freedom of expression, fair process and privacy’. So, explicit mention is made of all this in the agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a word on medicines. I do not believe that there is a problem with medicines – not only because of ACTA but also because we are currently engaged in discussions with India on this. They have filed a request with the WTO on medicines. We are in discussion with them and I think we will come to a conclusion soon, one that I think will be appreciated by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also add that these kinds of patents are not covered by the chapter on customs in ACTA. There is an explicit reference to the obligatory licensing practice, which is very important in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on confidentiality, we have no problem disclosing the texts that we are discussing, but we are not alone. This is a plurinational negotiation, which means that the other parties around the table also have to agree on what will or will not be made public. The explicit question raised was whether you will have the possibility of discussing the eventual agreement before it is signed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not yet clear whether we will reach an agreement, but if we do, we have made sure that we will be in a position to discuss it before signature, as the Commission has obtained this in the negotiation. As you can see, the press release issued at the end of the Washington Round explicitly states that the ‘parties commit to release the text before deciding to sign it’. I think it is difficult to be any more explicit about this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 175 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I call for this document to be referred back to committee.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have been waiting for this directive for a great many years but, as has been stressed in several other speeches, there are some items that need to be thoroughly amended in order to ensure adequate protection for animals. Adoption of this legislation will allow for experimentation for teaching purposes and the reuse of the same animal several times, even in procedures that cause it to suffer. It will not in any way encourage alternative methods that are considered scientifically valid.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not a matter of adopting an extreme position, but rather of respecting Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires us to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings. We do not want to hold back research, but rather to encourage it along an ethically sustainable course.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is unacceptable to say that we can adopt this directive now and amend it in the years to come. We should take responsibility for making the necessary corrections to it now. This is not a political or ideological position; it is common sense, and common sense has no political hue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Green/EFA Group supports the referral back because we also have serious concerns about the text as it stands. At the moment, Member States have the right to adopt stricter animal protection measures if they wish. The new law would prevent that in future. This would discourage improvements and it is against what Parliament agreed to at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also state absolutely clearly that alternatives should be used wherever they are possible, but the wording of the text weakens the existing law. Similarly, we need a very clear definition of the conditions for use of non-human primates. Again, this is not the case in the text.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many problems that we have with the current legislation have resulted from differing interpretations in different Member States. We need more debate on this and on the other points to ensure that we have absolute clarity and to ensure that this legislation is effective.</p>

Mrs Evans, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, was present during all the trialogue negotiations and supported the results of the trialogue meeting on 7 April.

As the chair of the committee has already explained, they were rejected by all the groups with the exception of the Greens.</p>

I am not entirely satisfied with it and I am certain that no one here can be completely happy with all the points, simply because it is a compromise.

      <p sl="pl">The progress of science is a condition for economic development, and innovative research is therefore the basis of new and better methods which benefit the economy in general and people in particular. However, the costs related to this must not be treated lightly. The welfare of living beings should be the most important thing in the economy. If people do not respect natural laws, or if they interfere with them too much, nature may resist. This is why the recommendations adopted today are so important. I voted in favour of their adoption, because it is a good compromise. On the one hand, the directive makes it possible to conduct essential scientific research while, on the other, it reduces, as much as is possible, the suffering of the animals used in this research.</p>

      <p sl="sl">The European Animal Testing Directive from 1986 is in real need of updating. I am not pleased with the fact that the new legislative proposal still permits the testing and suffering of animals, but I voted in favour of the directive nonetheless. Why?</p>
      <p sl="sl">Largely for three reasons. The first reason is that the proposal permits animal testing only in situations where human welfare outweighs animal welfare. This is about human dignity and the human right to health and medical treatment, about the human right to the best possible treatment. The second reason is that, under the new directive, significantly fewer animals will be used for testing than before. The third reason is that the animals that will still undergo testing will have better living conditions and will be taken better care of.</p>

Therefore, I am very pleased that our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has succeeded during the course of long negotiations in bringing about a significant improvement in the welfare of experimental animals.</p>
      <p sl="de">The aim of the new directive is to ensure that animal experiments are replaced and reduced to the absolute minimum that is necessary. These tests will only be permitted if there are no alternatives, but they will be subject to very strict regulations. This represents a good compromise between animal welfare and freedom of research. For the first time, we will have a high level of animal welfare throughout Europe. This is a major success.

      <p sl="en">Can I say that this is important for animal welfare, but also for the continuation of research in the European Union. We risk pushing scientists and research into medical conditions outside our borders where there is less regulation, so while we do need to improve the regulation and indeed the welfare of animals used in testing in research institutions and universities, we also need to guarantee that the research can continue.</p>

It is no secret that very strong arguments have been put forward on both sides of this issue. There are those who believe that the rights of the animals have priority. We, on the other hand, believe that society also has the right to see progress in the development of medicines and the treatment of diseases. Our task is, of course, to ensure that we strike the right balance. Animals must be treated appropriately, but our researchers must have the tools they need to develop new forms of treatment and to cure serious diseases. The report drawn up by Mrs Jeggle strikes a very precise balance and we are therefore of the opinion that it is worth voting for. We also fundamentally believe that it is a good thing that we can now at last move on from the legislation that dates all the way back to 1986.</p>

The legislation is clear: it establishes criteria for the treatment of animals for scientific use and requires the Member States to ensure that the number of animals used in projects is reduced to a minimum.</p>

I believe the adopted text will bring about direct and tangible animal welfare benefits while, at the same time, it will allow essential medical research to continue in Europe, which hopefully will deliver new, innovative and effective treatments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise that we have reached today is also an important step towards harmonising European regulations on animal experimentation and that, in itself, I think, is very important.</p>

Nevertheless, we still need animal experiments to some extent, because no alternatives to them have been discovered. It is very important, however, to ensure that they take place in the right conditions and that they cause as little harm, pain and suffering as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is an excellent step forward, as we know that the previous directive dates back to 1986.

      <p sl="sk">I very much appreciate the work of Mrs Jeggle, but I cannot support the text of the directive, because neither the Council nor the Commission has guaranteed a prohibition on the use of human embryo cells to save animals. The directive is proof of the fact that, as people, we feel responsible for the other living creatures on the Earth, but it also bears sad witness to the fact that we do not value human life highly. We are prepared to restrict the use of monkeys for research only to cases involving the preservation of a species or a threat to human life. Even then, research is permitted only if it can be shown that no other method would be appropriate. However, we are incapable of providing similarly strict protection to human foetuses, unborn children or even genetic information.

In several Member States at present, there are better methods already in place for obtaining the results of research, without using animals for experiments. This practice would actually slow down the development of alternatives.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the debate on the new Europe 2020 employment guidelines is taking place in the midst of the economic crisis, which will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the labour market for several years to come.</p>
      <p sl="it">The current crisis has revealed the absence of any effective mechanisms for reacting promptly to the signs of a crisis. It shows, therefore, how necessary the coordination of the European Union’s economic policies is, provided it is strengthened and made effective. The crisis has also highlighted the close interdependence between the Member States’ economies in terms of markets and employment. I would argue, therefore, that the efforts made by the European Union and the Member States to attain the Europe 2020 targets require a strong commitment to ensuring that investments in sustainable economic growth also facilitate the creation of sustainable jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The strategy should prevent any further economic and social collapse through close coordination with structural and cohesion policy. Indeed, if we wish to ensure that these new policy guidelines are effective, appropriate consideration has to be given to ensuring that the socio-economic disparities between Member States and between the regions are overcome. The EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund of the current programming period and any future EU funding instruments have a crucial role to play in this regard.</p>

I admire the work done by the rapporteur, despite the short time she had available.</p>
      <p sl="it">The attempt at simplification is certainly a positive point, in that a new, simpler format is proposed for the employment guidelines, of which there are now four, which clearly identify the targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. Equally positive in my view is the attempt to take account of the mistakes made in the past, which have led to a partial failure to meet the Europe 2010 targets.</p>

Work and employment must be the key outputs of any successful economic policy. Linking growth and job retention to the development of a green economy will, at the same time, also put in place the preconditions for preventing climatic and environmental problems. The natural disasters that have been occurring for many years, especially the floods in various parts of Europe, show that some new sustainable jobs can also be created in the area of constructing flood defences.

      <p sl="it">This trend stands in stark contrast to the Commission’s programme, which this House has adopted, and the approach of the specific Europe 2020 programme, which foresees the need for economic growth to be necessarily accompanied by signs of inclusiveness. The integrated guidelines that we have adopted today are a highly positive step in that direction, including the seventh, which calls on the Member States of the Union to reduce structural unemployment by means of concrete actions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must always bear in mind that work lies at the basis of entire legal codes, including Italy’s, Article 1 of which states that ‘Italy is a democratic Republic based on work’, and that work also lies at the basis of human dignity.</p>

Mostly, these vacant jobs require a skilled labour force. I urge the Commission, therefore, to introduce without delay the proposed European Vacancy Monitoring System, which should also include a European skills passport.</p>

      <p sl="en">Last night, I was pleased to hear the Belgian Presidency commit to looking at the Parliament’s recommendations. I would say to the Council that it is crucial that they take on board many of the really excellent recommendations in Mr Őry’s report – in particular, I think, those referring to improved governance. Everybody agrees that the open method of coordination was certainly not effective with regard to the Lisbon agenda. We need to ensure that the targets and sub-targets contained are monitored and evaluated against the EU 2020 objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is to be welcomed that the European Commission submitted the proposal on the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines which we have adopted in Parliament, today. In view of the current global economic situation, it is a good step, which shows the commitment of the EU institutions and their assumption of responsibility for the economy and employment. It is also to be welcomed that in establishing the guidelines, the need to maintain coherence and transparency was not forgotten. Measures such as increasing labour market participation, reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce, promoting job quality and lifelong learning, increasing the numbers of people in higher education and combating poverty and social exclusion must be put into effect as a matter of urgency, because they ensure a sustainable economy and strengthen job creation potential. The report is right in saying that it is necessary to facilitate the creation of sustainable jobs when making investments in sustainable economic growth, and also to ensure that the socio-economic disparities between Member States and between the regions are overcome. In summary, I would like to express the profound hope that Europe 2020 will produce the results which are expected of it, particularly in the area of employment policy.</p>

Like those, it immediately spilled out from behind its borders and sought to replicate itself around the world. Like those, it made no acknowledgement of the principles of sovereignty or territorial jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The signature act of the ayatollahs was the siege of the American Embassy. Even in the Second World War, when mutually opposed ideologies fought to extirpate each other, the sanctity of diplomatic legations was respected. What the ayatollahs were doing was signalling that the old rules did not apply to them and that they answered to a different authority. They have carried on as they started, disregarding any notion of territorial jurisdiction, sponsoring their militias and their terrorist organisations. From the Gulf to the Lebanon, to the Silk Road khanates, to the Balkans, they have struck at civilian targets as far away as London and Buenos Aires.</p>

In view of this, I also believe that it is vital to come to a compromise which aims to promote the advancement of alternative methods to the use of animals and ensures their increased welfare, without compromising progress within the sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The most important points agreed in this report relate to aspects of animal welfare which are being replaced with the aim of advancing alternative approaches which do not involve the use of live animals. It is also aimed at introducing a process of classifying the methods used on animals based on levels of pain, setting a maximum limit of pain, and applying the directive through a more effective system of control. The lack of monitoring sometimes has meant that there were experiments for which there were alternatives to using animals, but that animals nevertheless continued to be used, especially in basic experiments that were not aimed at proving scientific hypotheses.</p>

In the agreement most attention was paid to promoting the alternatives to animal testing and improving the conditions animals are held and used in. We also managed to retain the observations made by the European Parliament at first reading on the reduction of administrative burden and the continuity and viability of European research and industry still relying on the use of animals. There is a need for further promotion of alternatives to animal testing. In response an EU reference laboratory for the validation of alternative methods, supported by Member States' efforts to bring in further resources in terms of suitable specialised laboratories, is envisaged.

      <p sl="ro">I applaud the European Union’s concern about the welfare of animals in general and of those used for scientific purposes in particular. However, in light of the European Union’s huge enlargement and the technical progress made, a new directive needed to be adopted which will attempt to standardise the practices involved in the treatment of animals. Animal protection and ensuring their proper treatment are a community value which has a unanimously approved protocol devoted to it. The EC directive from 1985 endeavoured to eliminate the discrepancies between Member States’ provisions laid down by law and administrative acts relating to the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. However, the discrepancies between Member States have widened since the relevant directive was adopted, especially as the EU has accepted new members since then.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The resolution adopted by Parliament will narrow the differences between the level of protection afforded animals used for scientific purposes in Member States at a time when we are all aware that this practice is a necessity for protecting the health of humans and animals, as well as for the environment.

      <p sl="pt">I believe that this revision of the legislation makes higher standards that reinforce animal protection necessary. With this directive, the European Union will improve its standards applicable to the welfare of animals used in scientific experiments, since it plays a significant role in reducing the number of animals used in experiments and requires the use of alternative methods wherever possible, whilst ensuring fair competition conditions for the EU’s industrial sector and reinforcing the quality of investigation undertaken in the EU.

      <p sl="fr">I supported this agreement for a second reading because we must respond to the reality of biomedical research and to patients’ needs while, at the same time, improving animal welfare.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fortunately, the number of animal experiments has fallen significantly over the last few years because European research is moving towards the aim of finding alternative solutions. Unfortunately, we know that these solutions are not available in certain cases, and so we have to resort to animal experimentation, in particular, on non-human primates. This is the case, for example, with all the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ensuring this research is conducted in Europe is our only guarantee of a high level of animal welfare protection. Concern for an animal’s pain during an experiment ensures that good results will be obtained. This is why we must prevent any relocation of animal experimentation outside Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">I cannot support the animal experiments directive in its current form. It is true that this version is more progressive that the old directive from 1986. However, in comparison with the huge scientific and technical advances made over the last 24 years, the measures for replacing animal testing seem very feeble. There are too many exceptions. In addition, the wording is weak and allows too much scope for interpretation and implementation. It is also absurd that Member States cannot put in place animal welfare measures which are stricter than those required by the EU. Market distortion is given as the justification for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">This sends the wrong message to the citizens of Europe, to the research community and to industry. On the one hand, the state must take into account the changes in citizens’ ethical awareness. On the other hand, more pressure must be exerted on the research sector and on industry. No one wants to put the status of Germany or Europe as a research location at risk, but investment costs are not a valid argument for postponing the further development and use of methods which do not involve laboratory animals.</p>

Today, the European Parliament adopted an important document regulating scientific research with animals. This document will ensure a positive balance between animal protection and scientific research and provide for several important aspects, ensuring the protection of animals used for scientific research. Sceptics maintain that this directive contradicts animal protection principles and that there are many doubts over the use of animals for scientific purposes. However, under the latter directive, it is obligatory to assess the need to use animals and possible alternatives before each test. Each Member State is also obliged to establish national committees to take care of animal welfare and ethical aspects.

This directive is strongly unfavourable to animals. It ‘widens’ the threshold of acceptable pain during experiments from ‘light’ to ‘moderate’; it allows experimentation on stray dogs and cats, leaving it at the discretion of researchers whether to carry our experiments on animals without administering anaesthetic or painkillers; it allows use of the same animal more than once, even in painful procedures; it allows social animals such as dogs and primates to be kept in isolation; and it allows the chest to be cut open without analgesics and experiments on live animals for teaching purposes. I have the human sensitivity to find needless cruelty unacceptable and the political sensitivity to understand that if Europe had not approved this directive, some scientific research would inevitably have moved elsewhere. This European directive represents a serious backward step to which Member States will be obliged to adapt their national regulations. I believe that an amended version favourable to the animal world, supplemented by greater incentives for scientific research performed in Europe, would have been the real solution for a society that loves to call itself civilised.</p>

      <p sl="it">There are numerous gaps, and it ought to encourage the use of more advanced experimental methods that can take the place of animal experiments: in vitro methods, computer simulations of human metabolism, etc. It should also acknowledge the fact that it is often not possible to extrapolate results from one species to another, as eminent scientists have stated.</p>

This restriction of national discretion serves no useful purpose. Animals will become victims of the internal market’s toe-the-line dogma.

There are differences across Europe, however. In Spain and Greece, for example, the number of people out of work is worrying and mostly affects young people. In my country, however, as luck would have it, but also thanks to the good measures adopted by the Italian Government, the number of jobless has not risen so dramatically. One has to acknowledge that the Italian Government has been at the forefront in promoting flexibility and dynamism in the job market, and that recipe seems to be working.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some governments that are over-inclined to defend workers’ rights have allowed their own workers to lose their jobs. Being more flexible and ready for a competitive new labour market saves jobs instead, and creates economic conditions that encourage the appearance of new ones.</p>

      <p sl="it">This objective has not yet been completely achieved in that the unemployment rate is still high. It is important to analyse the problems that have made full employment slow down. Eliminating discrimination based on gender, race, ethnic origin and religion would be a remarkable step forward, which would allow especially young people and women to become more competitive in the job market. Women also face the difficulty of reconciling motherhood and work: improving company crèches, granting part-time work when requested, and allowing women to look after their sick children without having to worry about losing their jobs would be useful measures to help women play their dual role.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another group that needs protection is young people, who are liable to have no job security for years: they have plenty of ability and theoretical knowledge, but they lack practical experience. Schools need to look more closely at what companies want and prepare students for the world of work.

In addition, as I have had responsibilities in government in the field of education, I am pleased to see that this proposal places special emphasis on education and qualification for workers. In fact, this is a commitment that should be taken very seriously in the context of the EU 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States: Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. In view of the fact that the unemployment rate in the EU is 9.6%, it is imperative to intensify and rationalise employment policy in order to create new jobs. In Poland, EU support has benefited thousands of people who are now in employment. The money available for this purpose is not always spent wisely. The lack of properly specified guidelines means that many projects are carried out on an ad hoc basis. As a result, training sessions are not always adapted to the real situation and the same people often attend several times. Therefore, I endorse the Commission’s initiative in this area. These guidelines, developed as they were during the crisis, will be put to the test in the next few years. On these guidelines will depend whether the Union overcomes the crisis and whether the new jobs which are created meet the current and future needs of the labour market.</p>

For those reasons, I give the report my support. It contains guidelines which will allow people to better combine work and caring responsibilities, for example, through flexible working hours and accessible childcare. That is a concrete policy and one that will help women enter the labour market. Parliament also wants the countries of the EU to improve their social security systems and ensure a decent income, so that there can be a reduction in poverty and people find that it pays to enter work.

It is important both for our economy and our society. It is also important not to sacrifice quality for quantity, by failing to address the situation of the working poor, either at national or EU level. There is a significant group who work, but whose disposable income is insufficient for them to escape poverty. The economic recession has turned this into a problem for the whole of Europe and the situation is particularly difficult in Lithuania.</p>
      <p sl="lt">These tendencies are reflected very well in the minimum wages received by workers and the widespread reduction in wages as a severe austerity measure. People without a higher education are particularly vulnerable. According to EU statistics, the risk of poverty for a working person without a higher education is 16% – double the average in Lithuania and eight times more than for an employee with a university education. Unfortunately, this gap is much greater in Lithuania than anywhere else in the European Union. The issue of poverty among working people has not been sufficiently discussed by the Member States, including my country.

I did this because I believe that the sentence of death by stoning handed down to Sakineh Ashtiani is a clear violation of Iran’s international obligations. Regardless of the facts, this type of punishment can never be justifiable or acceptable. Torture, illegal detention, physical and sexual violence and impunity for state agents continue to be widespread practice in many countries. This raises serious doubts about the impartiality and transparency of the court proceedings in those places. The continuing persecution of ethnic and religious minorities, along with the persistent criminalisation of free sexual relations between adults, is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this situation, it is up to us, as European defenders of the human rights and democratic values which form the basis of our institutions, to bring every possible pressure to bear on the Iranian authorities to reassess processes like this. This pressure has already borne fruit, as the Iranian Government has announced that it has suspended the sentence of death by stoning against Sakineh Ashtiani. I must pay tribute to the courage of all the Iranian men and women who are struggling to defend their basic freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="el">The European Parliament has hastened to declare its support for imperialist plans in the Middle East and for the undisguised military threats by Israel, the US and NATO against Iran. On the pretext of the barbaric death penalty by stoning passed on Sakineh Mohammad-Ashtiani and the unacceptable persecution of the grassroots movement, all the political groups in the European Parliament have, in a rare display of unanimity, adopted a resolution to step up imperialist intervention in Iran. The Greek Communist Party did not support the resolution, because it has nothing to do with the solidarity needed in the fight by the working class against the reactionary and backward-looking regime which, on the contrary, is strengthened by sanctions and such resolutions. It is telling that the debate in the European Parliament was decided immediately after representations by the Israeli Embassy in Brussels, which called on it not to address infringements of human rights in Israel and to turn its attention instead to Iran.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament’s sensitivity on the issue of human rights is the fig leaf for the aggressive foreign policy of the EU and its crimes against workers, immigrants and peoples. The fight against NATO, the EU and the imperialist unions is becoming more and more necessary if the people are to win rights and freedoms and determine their own fate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a 43-year-old Iranian woman, is at risk of being stoned to death for adultery and for conspiring to murder her former husband. As an MEP and Chair of the Femmes au Centre (Women at the Centre) Association, I am incensed at this sentence, which everyone believes to be arbitrary. Indeed, this decision flouts the most fundamental human rights: it fails to respect the right of defence and human dignity. Still today, in some countries, two types of justice exist side by side: women are sentenced and tortured in violation of their fundamental rights, and by men, who hold all the power. I am pleased that Parliament’s resolution calling on the Iranian regime to change its mind over this sentence was adopted almost unanimously, as this gives it considerable clout. We now expect real progress to be made with regard to human rights in Iran.</p>

I therefore strongly support the European Parliament’s position which severely condemns the death penalty and urges the Iranian authorities to abolish the use of the death penalty, to eliminate all forms of torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and to end the persecution of human rights defenders. I support the European Union’s goal of promoting human rights worldwide and the implementation of related support programmes, such as the EU-funded European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. This instrument, which has a budget of EUR 1.1 billion for 2007-2013, aims to ensure respect for human rights and democracy throughout the world. The Commission and the Council, together with other international organisations, should therefore continue to actively prepare additional aid instruments in order to actively defend Iran’s human rights activists.</p>

Iran today is a country that symbolises the violence of radical Islam and fanaticism against women and their basic rights. With this resolution, we rightly call on the Islamic Republic and its leaders to respect the international human rights conventions, which Iran is legally bound to respect. The case of Sakineh, together with the others contained in the text that we have voted for, confirms that today, Tehran may not only be found in complete opposition to modern political and cultural values, but also places itself on a plane of illegality with regard to international norms, failing to comply with binding agreements on the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The resolution is firm, rightly firm, at a time when we should make Iran feel all the force and pressure of which this institution is capable, so that the international movement to stop the executioner of the Islamic Republic achieves its desired effect. I therefore voted decisively in favour.</p>

The sentence has been suspended for the moment, but this is ultimately meaningless. This is why the efforts of all members of the international community must be continued, with the aim of having the death penalty banned in states like Iran where people’s lives are at the mercy of warped, archaic laws.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union must continue to condemn and exert pressure on states where there is no respect for human life and human rights mean nothing. There are people in Iran who risk their life and personal safety every day, fighting for greater freedom and more democratic rights. International associations and bodies show their support for these people. However, when faced with an oppressive regime caught in a time warp, like the one in Tehran, the battle is going to be difficult and protracted. No one should pay with their freedom because they have expressed their views openly against a regime or some leaders. The European Union must get actively involved in its role as an exporter of freedom and respect for people and their rights.</p>

Of course, I agree with the sentiments that stoning to death (or any other death sentence) for adultery is completely unacceptable even for Muslim countries that might wish to prohibit such conduct by law. Whilst I am not in favour of using the criminal law to enforce moral conduct between consenting adults, I respect the right of other countries to take a different view, as long as they do not use disproportionate and savage sentences. I am also alarmed at the use of the criminal law against political dissent, either in Iran or those countries in the EU that are guilty of this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There are still three months left until the end of 2010, and the judicial system of the Islamic Republic of Iran has this year already managed to pass 2 000 sentences of capital punishment. On the optimistic assumption that the last quarter does not bring a single further such sentence, and also assuming that we know of all such sentences, this means that every day, five Iranian citizens are informed that they are soon to lose their lives. In the morning, it may be Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani who, in 2006, was condemned to death by stoning for adultery. At noon, it may be the turn of Mohammad Mostafaei, the human rights lawyer who fled Iran for fear of arrest and repression. In the afternoon, the next victim of the Iranian regime may be Nasrin Sotoudeh, who is fighting for a reduction in the numbers of death sentences handed down to minors, while in the evening, for taking part in a street protest, the next person to be arrested is the Dutch citizen Zahra Bahrami.</p>

What country, in the 21st century, can write in black and white in its penal code the size of the stones that should be thrown at a convicted prisoner in order to kill them? Iran is that country. Only the involvement of the international and political community has been able to prevent stoning over the last few years, and it alone will be able to make the Iranian Government give way.

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Minister, you have received the question. Today, I am going to talk about the substance of the question. A 200 metre-long helicopter carrier, with the capability of carrying at one and the same time, 16 heavy helicopters, 40 tanks, 900 service personnel, landing craft, and equipped with a military hospital. France wishes to sell four such aggressive warships to Russia, without consulting the other European Union Member States. I would remind you that 18 months ago, Russia attacked its neighbour Georgia and has still not complied with the terms of the truce negotiated by the President of France. Furthermore, last autumn, Russia carried out military exercises on the Estonian border, aimed at the occupation of the Baltic States. I should like to pose all of you a question. What is the European Union, and why do we need it? In the spring, when Greece was severely struck by the financial crisis, Europe had a choice – to help or to let Greece sink. In a show of solidarity, the countries of Europe decided to help Greece, for there was a common understanding among the Member States that, if the financial situation in Greece got any worse, it would also get worse in other European Union Member States. The external security sphere is no exception. We have bound ourselves by agreements to act in solidarity in this sphere too. Many European Union Member States have serious concerns about where and for what purposes Russia would station and use such aggressive warships. Jobs in France are important. However, they cannot be created at the cost of other EU Member States’ security. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you not to allow the sale of arms of any description to third countries before the issue has been discussed in the Council and there is absolute certainty that such a transaction would serve to strengthen and not weaken the security situation throughout the European Union. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity that we have this afternoon to focus on the control of arms exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Baroness Ashton is unable to attend this session, she has asked the Presidency to stand in for her during this debate and I will therefore endeavour to answer some of the questions that we have received on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, for some years now, the European Union has played a leading role in the control of arms exports, both regionally and internationally, and our aim is clear: we want to prevent the export of military technologies that could be used for undesirable ends such as internal repression or international aggression.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over 10 years ago, the Council adopted an EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which set out a series of criteria for exporting conventional arms. This code was replaced in 2008 by a common position that introduced a number of new elements, resulting in the European Union having the strongest system of arms export control in the world. The common position’s legally binding provisions are there to ensure that Member States carry out arms exports in a responsible and transparent fashion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The purpose of the common position is to effectively coordinate national policies on the control of arms exports using, in particular, a denial notification and consultation mechanism. This mechanism means that, when a Member State is planning to grant an export licence which has been previously denied by another Member State for an essentially identical transaction, it must consult this Member State and notify all Member States of its final decision. In other words, the Member State granting a licence for a transaction that has been denied by another Member State must provide a detailed explanation of its decision to all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in answer to questions about consultations, the situation is clear: the common position obviously only calls for systematic consultation when a licence for an identical transaction has previously been denied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In general, Member State delegations within the competent structures of the Council regularly and often exchange information on the control of arms and, in particular, on so-called ‘sensitive’ destinations. Member States often solicit the opinions of other members of the Council on any destination that might give cause for concern or about which there might be any doubt. This regular exchange of information forms a central pillar of the European Union’s policy for the control of arms exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For your information, during the course of 2009, consultations between Member States looked at a total of 14 third-country destinations. Member States then communicated what led them to decide whether to grant or deny export licences to these destinations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, Mr President, is how we proceed in terms of information, control and interactivity between Member States, to give an idea of how we authorise arms exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am more than happy to respond to any other point raised during this afternoon’s debate.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strengthening of the industrial and technological basis of European defence is an essential part of developing a common defence system.</p>
      <p sl="it">What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to make a few comments. This concerns the old question of European competence. In the constitutional and government conferences, we were not able to include arms trading within the general European sphere of competence. I believe it would be sensible to continue trying to achieve this, so that the Code of Conduct and the regulations introduced by the Council in 2008 can be made more binding. The European Parliament should work towards this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it seems to me to be clear that it should not be possible in this context for there to be so little contact between the Member States that individual Member States have the feeling that arms exports to third countries take place at their expense and threaten their security. Whether this is right or wrong, the case is almost irrelevant. For this reason, I believe that we need to find more effective European solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I am of the opinion that greater European cooperation is required, among other things, for reasons of industrial policy, for example, via the European Defence Agency, with regard to exports, research, planning, production and procurement, because when a country has its own arms industry, this is related to its independence. If a country does not have its own arms industry and has to buy all its military equipment from third countries, it is dependent for its security on other states. This concerns our freedom and is not only related to economic factors, although I cannot deny that these also play a role.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to put everything into context and then we will be able to give this area a much stronger sense of community, without misunderstandings arising among the Member States like the one which understandably occurred recently among the Baltic States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to be clear that indeed it is permissible to defend yourself; other countries are able to defend themselves; so arms exports are not off-limits. That is the position of the ALDE Group.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we should not export to regions of tension or of war. We should limit ourselves, and if we do not have a real, legally-binding regime on arms exports, it means that the 27 countries of the European Union will not have a level playing field. They will compete and fight for orders and there will be no real consultation.</p>
      <p sl="de">So I think that the only way to resolve this issue is to have a binding common regime and I also support the words of my colleague, Mr Brok, on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an important issue, and I thank colleagues for their understanding of the concerns my region is having with a particular French decision about Mistral platforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU Code of Conduct, which has been a legally binding text since 2008, is a good step but is not enough, as has also been mentioned by our Liberal colleague. We should continue work on the global-level arms trade because the EU has a great responsibility. We are responsible for one third of the volume in arms trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the proposition is that Russia is our strategic partner and we can cooperate on military affairs with Russia, for me it is a question of logic. Why does our friend need an assault weapon system? To participate in an effort to organise some sort of good governance in Afghanistan? No, Moscow has no intention of participating in that operation. To protect human and minority rights in Kyrgyzstan? No, and in both cases Mistral is no use because it cannot approach these landlocked countries. It will change the situation in the Black Sea – not for better, but for worse – and also affect eight European Union Member States around the Baltic Sea. The security situation of those states – from Poland and Germany to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – will worsen.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Mr Gualtieri that cooperation with our strategic partner is a good thing but, believe me, there are other means of cooperating with Russia than high-tech weapon systems. Think about cars – this is something Russian industry is also struggling with. Think about cooperation between fire brigades. The Russian fire fighters were in trouble this summer when an area of forest equal to the size of Belgium was burning.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group attaches great importance to the right of our sovereign nations to decide whether or not to issue an arms export licence in accordance with criteria in the agreed EU common position. Clearly this is not a matter where the EU decides, nor should it be. The common position, of course, urges exporting Member States to consider, inter alia, the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case which seems to be the focus of this discussion, we should be aware of the sensitive nature of the situation in both the Baltic and Black Sea regions. As far as the Black Sea is concerned, we should recall the recent conflict in Georgia and the fact that, of the six Black Sea littoral states, three – Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania – are NATO members, and two others – Georgia and Ukraine – are NATO partners and aspiring members. We might therefore question the wisdom of the sale of amphibious assault vessels to the sixth: Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are well-established mechanisms to cover issues related to arms exports. In the EU context, this is the Council working group on conventional arms exports – COARM – which meets formally about every six weeks in Brussels. As it is intergovernmental, it is the right forum for discussion of arms exports; a Strasbourg plenary session is not. We should let COARM get on with its work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in 2000, the European Union clearly stated in the Lisbon strategy its objective of becoming the leading economic power in the world by 2010. We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU’s interest in the export of arms is clearly part of the increasing militarisation of the EU in the post-Lisbon era.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tony Blair himself told journalists just days ago that he wanted to see the EU develop a ‘military character’. A big part of this will be who the EU gets its weapons from and who it sells those weapons to.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a dilemma faces all arms manufacturing countries over the issue of arms exports. The fixed costs are self-evidently and inevitably high, which makes it uneconomic for most – if not all – countries to manufacture arms for their own use only. It would be tempting for some arms manufacturing countries simply to have a policy to export arms to any country other than ones that it has reason to believe might attack itself or its interests. That would maximise the interests of the country producing the arms. However, it would at best be an amoral policy and, at worst, a thoroughly immoral one.</p>
      <p sl="en">The criteria stated in the original question for deciding whether to export arms are many and varied. Different criteria might apply to different kinds of weaponry. Countries with poor human rights records such as Iran – and, for that matter, those EU countries that lock people up for political dissent or heretical opinion, such as half the countries in the EU – should be denied small arms, surveillance systems and articles of restraint, but might not be denied weaponry to protect them from external attack.</p>
      <p sl="en">Countries that are prone to waging aggressive wars, but respect the rights of their own citizens, might be sold small arms and restraint mechanisms, but not weapons of mass destruction. In particular, the United States – arguably the most aggressive country on the planet, having waged countless destabilising, aggressive and illegal wars – should be denied any technology that might be used for weapons of mass destruction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran, however much we might deplore its human rights record – and I certainly do – has not carried out any attacks on its neighbours. It was not, for example, the aggressor in the Iran-Iraq war. However, it may be the focus of aggression and a planned attack, possibly by the United States and possibly by Israel. We might not wish it to have weaponry that could be used to launch an attack – and I certainly would not – but we might want it to have access to a nuclear shield to prevent it from being attacked.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not want to do the previous speaker the honour of referring to his speech, but at the beginning he said something that was correct. He said that it was very expensive for many individual states with smaller arms industries to produce arms cost-effectively. Of course, the conclusion I draw from this is different from his, namely that within the European Union, we should produce the necessary military equipment more cheaply via the European Defence Agency and via common procurement programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would first like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement. I think it is very important in political terms for us to be able to state here that we have the most modern legally binding criteria for arms exports in the world. In my opinion, the European Union should be proud of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, I have one question for the President-in-Office of the Council. You have explained the type of cases where consultation takes place and this obviously only happens when an identical application from a state has been rejected and another state intends to authorise an export application. Were the discussions on this subject restricted to the Council working group or, and this is my second question, has this already been discussed at a political level in the Council of Ministers? In this context, this is another question which interests me.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Some fellow Members have already mentioned that the question posed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) hides certain riddles and charades, failing to explain clearly why and how the problem has arisen. It would have been helpful to have more clarity when raising this question. On the other hand, we must recognise that some Central and Eastern European countries are particularly sensitive and feel less secure than the old European Union Member States. The Council Common Position of 8 December 2008 drew up certain guidelines in the area of arms exports. Experts recognise that the country we are talking about today – France – did not exceed the limits of these guidelines, but that does not mean that when implementing security and defence policy increasingly in practice, we should not improve and revise those guidelines and rules. I agree entirely with the opinion of my fellow Member, Elmar Brok, that we must cooperate more in the area of arms. As for arms exports, we must ensure that there is more trust and less suspicion: sometimes well-founded, sometimes spread without reason. The latter pits large and small, old and new EU Member States dangerously against each other. We need more trust and solidarity, which will not appear of its own accord. We must talk more, engage in constructive consultations and avoid heated accusations and artificial parallels with the beginning or middle of the 20th century, when the might is right dominated Europe. We must improve the consultation mechanism within the EU to achieve a concrete result. Then, this discussion will also be of some benefit.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Fine words are being spoken here about cooperation and trust, but I have the impression that policy on exporting outside the Union is, in fact, decided by faits accomplis carried out by the French. The largest and richest Member States do what they like, and do not pay attention to the standards and rules about which so much is being said today. Only in the last few days, we have heard once again of the sale by France of Mistral assault vessels to Russia. If this matter has not yet been finalised, it is only because Russia has initiated special tender procedures, but in any case, we know the transfer will go ahead. In the meantime, a Russian Admiral has recently said about the Russian aggression against Georgia that if Russia had possessed Mistral assault vessels, the war against Georgia would not have taken four or five days, but only two hours. Should EU Member States really be selling such weapons when it is known that the purchasing countries are not going to use the weapons for defensive purposes, but for offensive ones? Meanwhile, Georgia has not been able to buy defensive weapons from EU Member States for years, because there is a special embargo in place on the purchase of these weapons. These are double standards and should be avoided.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, reading the common position and the criteria which must be met by countries which export arms, the image of Israel came to mind. Israel is a state which does not respect international law, which tramples over human rights and which has invaded Gaza and I should like, at this point, to say to those who tabled the question that I have not heard one voice raised, in the wake of recent events, calling for provision to be made for the sanction of a ban on exports of military equipment and arms, together with the other sanctions which need to be imposed on Israel, which does not meet these criteria, sanctions which, for the rest, they have touched on in the common position.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first speaker referred, within the framework of political solidarity in Europe, to the example of Greece. May I remind you that, while criterion 8 of the common position states that, when one Member State of the European Union wants to export arms to another, it must take account of the economic standing of the country to which it is exporting, in the case of Greece, France and Germany are putting pressure on it to buy their arms in order to secure their political support and are doing so at a time when Greece is in very dire financial straits and is subject to numerous controls, at a time when pensions, salaries and so on are being cut in the country.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The activity in question can be performed only on the basis of a permit issued by the state in the form of a permit to deal in military materials or a licence for the import, export or cross-community transport of military materials. The whole process is implemented in accordance with very precise rules, and is subject to stringent controls by individual countries that are obliged to proceed in accordance with their foreign policy obligations. In view of the specificity and uniqueness of every actual transaction, this activity should, in my opinion, be coordinated just on an individual basis at Council level, and mostly in general terms, with a particular emphasis on evaluating the possible specific foreign policy consequences.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will make three brief points on this subject. Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the conventional arms industry is an important contributor to the economies of many Member States, including my own, the United Kingdom. In an unstable and dangerous world, EU Member States need the capacity to defend themselves, their interests and their allies around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the EU, by unanimous agreement intergovernmentally in Council, has made impressive efforts and progress in recent years to restrict the production and distribution of certain weapons and even ban the supply of arms to certain repressive regimes. We can be rightly proud of our advocacy in favour of the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines globally. The issue of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which entered into force last month, will hopefully be another step towards eventually eliminating these nasty weapons – although I do note that at least six EU Member States are yet to ratify it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the EU’s neighbouring countries, we work hard under the MPI to monitor arms production and destroy nuclear weapon stockpiles, and this should be continued and even intensified.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must always be vigilant against efforts by terrorists to acquire arms from countries where end-user licence regimes and arms exports are less rigorously policed and enforced.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Union should maintain its ban on exporting arms to China, for two reasons. Firstly, because of the regime’s woeful human rights record against its own citizens, and secondly, to show our support for our democratic ally Taiwan, which is potentially first in China’s line of fire.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Ladies and gentlemen, weapons and military equipment are not simple trade goods; they constitute a specific sector with a direct effect on national security. The export of weapons and military equipment to third countries, especially those that are dubious democracies, where human rights are infringed, and which collaborate with countries where signs of terrorism can be observed, can pose a serious threat not only to the European Union but also to third countries. That is precisely why it must be considered as an important arm of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. How can we talk of a common defence policy, as Mr Barroso did yesterday, if every country can carry out its own separate arms trading? France’s decision to sell a Mistral warship constitutes a direct transfer of military technology to a third country that does not have a military alliance with Europe. We must recognise that technology transfer most certainly does not, of itself, mean that the relevant country has or will become more friendly towards the European Union, as Mr Lelouch, the French European Affairs minister and some honourable Members have maintained in today’s debate. No European Union strategy will succeed if it does not adhere to commonly adopted principles. That applies equally to solidarity between the countries of the European Union and to the recognition of common interests in the decision-making process. The Treaty on European Union and the Council Common Position defining common rules governing the control of exports of military technology and equipment both stress the importance of solidarity. Individual short-term economic interests must not stand in the way of the European Union’s common priorities and objectives. Decisions with an impact on the European Union’s foreign and security policy must be taken jointly in consultation with all the EU Member States, and an adequate and legally binding mechanism, under which all the possible consequences are analysed according to jointly developed criteria, must be drawn up for them.

      <p sl="el">Let us not forget that, in the United States, tanks are manufactured on just one production line, while in Europe, they are manufactured on 16 different production lines. Consequently, we would have economies of scale. However, bearing in mind the Council’s 2008 common position on controls of arms exports, we must admit, Mr Chastel, that there is no real control. I do not refer to France; I refer to every country in Europe, just as no real controls are carried out in order to ascertain if the countries to which we export are, in turn, exporting to third countries, in other words, are intermediaries, to which we would never give arms.</p>
      <p sl="el">I get the impression that the group set up within the framework of the CFSP is not in a position to control the Member States in order to ascertain where exactly they are exporting arms. If we manage to apply this common position and if there are specific restrictions, then we shall have made a successful step. However, we shall only be really successful in controlling arms exports if we manage to create a truly common defence agency and arms manufacturing agency which allow us to reduce the cost and, at the same time, to support our principles and values and to demonstrate them in practice in the case of the production and export of arms.</p>

As has been said, the EU Treaty includes – and this must, of course, be a given – the principle of solidarity and a requirement for the Member States to consult one another within the Council and the European Council on any matter of foreign and security policy. Could this be put any clearer?</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Council’s Common Position of 8 December 2008 lays down common rules for the control of military technology and equipment. Where have these common positions gone? Have they not reached France? Have they perhaps not even reached us? The EU Member States of Lithuania, Estonia and Poland, as well as Georgia, claim that the sale of the Mistral warship to Russia has reduced the security of these countries. Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, has said that if Russia had had a Mistral class ship at the time of the conflict with Georgia, the Russian Black Sea Fleet would have performed its operation in 40 minutes instead of 26 hours.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The large Member States must not be allowed to take liberties. We know that large countries would very much like to have a monopoly on arms exports, which is quite obviously unacceptable. It should be the task of the country holding the Presidency, Belgium, to start discussions within the EU with the aim of achieving clear common provisions on arms exports.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is about bilateralism versus common policies and solidarity. In fact, citizens of several Member States have become seriously worried about imminent exports of modern military technology to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only a year ago, Russia conducted military manoeuvres in north-eastern Europe, the scenarios of which targeted the Baltic States as objects of military invasion. We have the famous words of the commander of the Russian navy to the effect that, if it had had Mistral carriers at its disposal in August 2008, it would have been able to complete its operation in three hours rather than three days.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy with the statement made by Secretary of State Chastel, which I consider a very positive reaction to our worries, and at the declaration made by our colleague, Mr Danjean, that no military technology will be sold. However, the Russians have insisted – and will continue to insist – on buying precisely that military technology.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is still one question to be answered, which is why do we not have consultations and normal debates in the Council in cases where one Member State is prepared to sell military technology to a third country? That is our message to the Council. We would draw attention to the necessity of routinely discussing, within the European Council, exports of military equipment to third countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the production and export of weapons, arms and military technologies was, is and will be the subject of much debate, and will continue to be a difficult subject to discuss because of its controversial and contentious nature. There have always been, and still can be, suspicions of stirring up conflicts and destabilisation of regions. Supervision of the export of weapons, as previous speakers have stressed, is also difficult. On the other hand, the arms industry is an important area of the economy for many of the European Union’s Member States. Arms are exported by France, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and many other Member States, and also by the United States, Russia and other countries outside the European Union. We are, therefore, very far from a situation in which the production and export of weapons becomes the subject of EU policy. Today, the Member States have a great degree of autonomy in this area, but they do need to harmonise their regulations in accordance with the Council Common Position of 2008.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A short comment about Mistral – fellow Members from France ought to understand the anxiety of the Baltic states and Poland. Russian generals are saying that these vessels may be stationed in the Baltic. The Baltic is a sea which is surrounded, apart from Russia, only by Member States of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the question asked by Mr Kariņš is clearly justified, and was asked several times at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Members did not receive a satisfactory answer. In relation to this, the Council must take specific steps in this matter in order to satisfy those who have asked this question, all the more so because the question has been given a context, which has been mentioned here several times, both by Mr Kelam and by Mr Czarnecki. I refer to the way in which military commanders in Russia are treating this type of weapon and, in particular, to the fact that the Mistral assault vessels are an offensive weapon. This must suggest the thought that this is not only a matter of making a sale, but should also give rise to questions about what the consequences of that sale would be. We do realise that the 2008 directive is in force, but we must also accept that sometimes, there is more to life than the provisions of a directive and existing regulations. The case of control of the conflict in Georgia, in which the European Union is interested and which has not been resolved, shows that such a decision is needed here.</p>

However, the subject of this debate raises my question and I feel the need to put it to plenary today.</p>
      <p sl="el">How can we justify the fact that arms industries, especially in the United Kingdom, apply a trade embargo to the Republic of Cyprus and to the armed forces in Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union, while at the same time allowing Turkey to modernise, move and transport military and other equipment within the territory of occupied Cyprus?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I was the rapporteur of this Parliament for several years during which this House practically unanimously called for the conversion of the 1998 Code of Conduct into a binding Common Position, which was adopted in 2008. However, back then, we said that this was going to be a further, albeit not definitive, step; one that was necessary, but not enough, a fact which has become clear from today's debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also remind the House that all European Union Member States are supporting the international treaty on the control of arms exports in the United Nations and that this is the key issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">Exporting arms is not like exporting refrigerators. It has very serious consequences because arms kill; they destroy and impoverish societies. The European Union is exactly contributing to this when it exports arms to Israel, when it exports arms to Colombia, when it exports arms to Afghanistan. It is by paying heed to this sense of responsibility that we should act.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consequently, I believe that it is necessary to remind the House that when dealing with this issue, it is not only a question of the internal market, of trade or security, but rather it is clearly one of international responsibility, and I am afraid that this is not what we are doing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the Lisbon Treaty, we have further improved policy coordination and solidarity in many areas, including foreign and security policy. The treaty also contains a mutual assistance clause in case any Member State is threatened militarily.</p>
      <p sl="en">In light of this, the plans by France to sell four Mistral warships to Russia and to share some of the shipbuilding technology seem very alarming. What is more, the Mistral warships are clearly offensive – I stress, offensive and not defensive – in nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, before we actually start doing something about the provisions of solidarity foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty, we should make sure that we do not diminish the security of our fellow EU Member States or that of our neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the export of arms is always related to EU security policy. The export of weapons is not an autonomous or isolated sphere. These matters are not restricted just to the military or financial sphere, because behind the export is the profit of the firms involved, and this is always related to policy. Therefore, I would like to support those who are proposing that a discussion be held at a meeting of the full Council on Union policy in the area of export and military cooperation. For example, we have a considerable number of remarks and doubts in relation to the export of Mistral assault vessels to Moscow, but if we look at it another way and think about, for example, the construction of a European anti-missile defence system, I think it would be in our interest to involve Russia. In other words, to put it briefly, these matters are not as obvious as they may appear.</p>

Bearing in mind that the European Union is producing weapons non-stop at the moment, and that there are almost 30 wars around the world, as well as countless other conflicts, whether regional or local, we should also realise that we are producing weapons that are directly intended for destruction and for killing.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Perhaps we should also give some thought to whether we would prefer the money which we contribute every year to the budgets of individual states for arming or equipping individual armies to be transferred in some way to education, which would actually be far more useful than weapons in a time of economic crisis. It would also interest me very much how some of you might perhaps answer the question: how many individual Member States have reduced their defence budgets in this time of economic crisis and by how much? Perhaps we should all give some thought to that, because I do not think we are providing a good example to the younger generations by believing that shooting, for example, which is actually a form of destruction, should be elevated to the level of an Olympic sport.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this was a very interesting debate and I would like to come back to two concepts in a little more detail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I would like to reframe the concept of responsibility. Article 4(2) of the common position lays down that the decision to transfer or deny the transfer of any military technology or equipment shall remain at the national discretion of each Member State. Consequently, this responsibility rests, first of all, at national level and clearly, the common position does not take this responsibility away from Member States but it does introduce a broad range of provisions to ensure effective coordination and exchange of information between them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second concept that I would like to come back to is the concept of transparency. The common position lays down that Member States must draw up an annual report on their arms exports. A European Union report drawn up on the basis of these national reports shall be published annually providing information on the financial value of the licences granted, broken down according to destination and category of military equipment, as well as on the number of licences refused and any subsequent consultations with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from the European Union’s annual report, the common position requires Member States to publish national reports concerning exports of military technology and equipment. The aim of transparency sought by the common position, therefore, applies both at European Union level and at national level, but it is true that the European Union should set an example in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say that, as several of you have pointed out, the common position represents considerable progress compared with the code of conduct. The common position was adopted in December 2008, that is, less than two years ago. It is reasonable for us to allow the new provisions introduced by the common position time to take effect before embarking on any revision of a new system of this kind, even though, having listened to you and indeed understood what you have been saying, it may seem tempting to make it more restrictive or link it with a system of sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, to clarify a very specific issue, I would like to say, rest assured, that the common position has been discussed on many occasions at the political level, in the Council in particular, especially in the context of the arms embargo on China.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am here as a friend of democracy and I am also here as a friend of Israeli democracy. It is because I worry about Israeli democracy that we tabled a question before the summer about a law that would apply to Israeli NGOs, which resembled some of the laws we know from other less democratic parts of this world. Part of that law was about including NGOs in the register of political parties and taking away their tax exemption status. That was deeply worrying for us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Happily, we noted that this has been changed and removed, but unfortunately, the law still foresees a draft law to further increase transparency regarding money that comes from foreign political entities. It does not require the same from private donors, which we find very worrying, and specifically addresses the European Union as one of the donors, when it comes to people supporting that law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is one of the targets of the new law because a lot of people in Israel who do not necessarily like democracy or human rights think that the EU supports project NGOs that go against the interests of Israel, without actually defining what these interests are.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are deeply worried and we would like to know what you think this would mean for EU funding? How do you think we should react to it? And can we not at least expect the same transparency rules for every donor – private or public, from the EU or any other country – when it comes to NGOs in Israel?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since I cosigned the oral question to the Commission on the new Israeli ‘NGO transparency bill’ – as it is referred to by the Israeli NGO which calls itself NGO Monitor – the bill has been considerably softened, as Franziska Brantner has just explained. My group and I welcome these changes. It is no longer required of all recipients of foreign funding for the purpose of political activities in Israel to register under the ‘political party’ register. It seems that these organisations are no longer at risk of losing their tax exemption status, and potential breaches of the law would be punished by a fine.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, these changes are to be welcomed. The Israeli authorities and a number of Israeli NGOs may not have liked our reaction to the original bill, but, as we have seen, our actions have had effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said this, the aim of the present draft still raises concern. Firstly, it seems to be directed at intimidating the EU and its Member States. In the background note that we received from the NGO which I already mentioned (Israeli NGO Monitor), we read the following, and I quote: ‘The EU and the Member States channel tens of millions of euros annually to a narrow group of highly-politicised Israeli NGOs through non-transparent processes. The degree to which European States are using NGO funding to influence Israeli political and public debates has no parallel in relations among democracies. Therefore, greater transparency regarding foreign government funding is central to the Israeli democratic process and the public’s right to know.’</p>
      <p sl="en">Needless to say, a number of those allegations are absolutely untrue but they are very revealing. They reveal how strong the distrust is between a number of Israeli opinion makers and the EU and we need to do something about it. They also reveal how embattled important segments of Israeli public opinion feel; that is also a matter of concern. Both elements make a peaceful solution in the Middle East even more difficult than it already is. My question to you Commissioner is: what do you intend to do about this to improve the situation?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Goldstone report had an unexpected outcome.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The intention was to establish the truth about possible war crimes during Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 and, in fact, it caused an outcry in Israel. Justice Goldstone was subjected to personal attacks and the NGOs that had the courage to give evidence became targets. Shortly after this media storm, a number of draft bills emerged intending to further control NGOs and weaken all opposition to government policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Among these was a draft bill on NGOs which initially sought to consider them as political organisations and therefore not exempt from taxation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, a draft bill on criminalising the boycott of Israeli goods, even goods from the settlements, including boycotts called for by a government, an organisation or a citizen of foreign origin. To put it plainly, if a French person calls for a boycott of goods from the settlements on the Internet, he could be penalised, and if the Palestinian Authority does so, it will receive the same treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, a draft bill on universal jurisdiction which gives Israel competence to decide on cases of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Various other draft bills that restrict freedom of speech or of movement are in progress. It is not possible to list them but they are all on the same lines and they are worrying. They amount to a direct attack on freedom of speech which is an inalienable human right and a necessary corollary of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the Knesset to have amended the law on NGOs to the point where it has become almost acceptable for the NGOs themselves is a good thing. It is to be hoped that the other draft bills will meet with the same fate, especially the law on boycotts, which will be submitted to the Knesset for first reading on 15 September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to draw the Commission’s attention to this point: if we can no longer say that goods imported illegally under the terms of our agreements may not be bought in Europe, it is as though we were prohibiting advice against the purchase of, for example, counterfeit goods or stolen watches on a market stall. Parliament will monitor this issue closely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, I would ask Europe: what are we in Europe doing in this Israeli-Palestinian peace process? Where was our High Representative? Where are we in this process that is so important?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, at the beginning of this year, the Israeli Government adopted a draft bill that directly calls into question the funding granted by the European Union to NGOs in Israel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I myself cosigned this question and I am pleased that this allows us to assess the excellent work of the Israeli NGOs, which are fighting on a daily basis for peace, democracy and, more generally, for human rights in the territory of the State of Israel. These NGOs are all too often the forgotten ones in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although they are doing a remarkable job, as I have already said, and they suffer much harassment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Israeli Government has backtracked slightly under pressure, particularly from us, but without changing the direction of its policy. Indeed, the Israeli authorities are seeking to put in place a veritable legal arsenal in order to prevent any criticism of their policy, including from abroad.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, too, am focusing on the provisions that seek to prohibit boycott activities and, worse still, one that calls into question the principle of universal jurisdiction that is enshrined in many international treaties of which Israel is a signatory. Unfortunately, however, we know that the Israeli Government sometimes takes a ‘variable geometry’ approach to international law. In fact, we know that these proposals represent the Israeli Government’s reactions to the Goldstone report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, the Union has established a privileged partnership with Israel which nothing seems able to call into question. It seems to us, however, in this House, that there are limits. We must bring about an end to the Israeli Government’s harassment of the NGOs that criticise its policy and unreservedly request that it withdraws these proposals that are unworthy of a state that claims to be a democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Can you assure us that, even if this legislation is adopted, although I hope that does not happen, the European Union will nonetheless continue unconditionally to finance these NGOs in Israel? Can you tell us what the Commission intends to do to convince the government to withdraw these measures and to safeguard the right to freedom of association, which is a fundamental pillar of democracy? Can you assure us that liaison officers with responsibility for human rights will be appointed in Israel as part of the process of setting up the European External Action Service so that the NGOs have negotiators on the ground?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, civil society organisations play a vital role in open and democratic societies. Israel has an unquestionable tradition of a free, open, and vibrant civil society playing a positive role in many sectors, including monitoring human rights, both in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, as well as highlighting environmental and cultural issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has been cooperating with Israeli non-governmental organisations for many years and has a keen interest in continuing this fruitful cooperation, in particular, since many Israeli NGOs have a reputation for professional excellence in their fields. This is why we followed with concern the debate in the Knesset on the bill on the ‘disclosure of funding from abroad’. We have made these concerns clearly known to the Israeli authorities on many occasions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As spelled out in the Commission’s European Neighbourhood Policy Progress Report, the first version of the bill, last February, contained new requirements on the activities of civil society that – if adopted – would have substantially hampered NGO work in Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new and substantially revised version of the bill was discussed during the summer by members of the Knesset, the government and civil society representatives. In August, a new draft was adopted at first reading in the Knesset.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the latest draft bill, provisions removing tax exemptions for NGOs and including an obligation to register in the political parties’ register have been shelved. These are certainly very welcome changes.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in our view, the reporting obligations imposed on NGOs would still become unnecessarily stringent, not least because the current administrative requirements for NGOs in Israel already ensure adequate transparency of public funding. Furthermore, these new transparency criteria would only cover public funding from abroad, while private foreign sources would not need to be disclosed – as has quite rightly been underscored. That approach would discriminate against those working with foreign public funding, including from the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the ENP Action Plan, Israel and the European Union have agreed to engage in a regular dialogue on civil society issues and to promote Israel-EU links between civil society. The latest EU-Israel working group on human rights met on 2 September, and also discussed in detail the issue of NGO funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bill will go through further discussions and readings in the Knesset in the coming months. We will continue to follow developments closely.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed legislation on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Israel has given us all great cause for concern. We were worried that the ability of NGOs in Israel to act would be significantly restricted.</p>
      <p sl="de">During a visit by a delegation of committee chairs from the European Parliament, which I took part in as chair of the Working Group on the Middle East, we expressed our concern to our colleagues in the Knesset in Jerusalem, in particular, during a very positive meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister, Dan Meridor. I would like to see clever, level-headed people such as Dan Meridor playing a much more prominent public role, rather than the Foreign Minister, for example, whose position we do not agree with at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">As all the speakers have said, the draft includes some improvements. I very much welcome what Mr Füle has said, but there are still some questions which need answering. Whenever restrictions are imposed on the tasks and the sphere of influence of human rights organisations and other NGOs, we must make our voice heard. The legislation has not yet been adopted and a decision is expected during the session of the Knesset in October. We will continue to monitor the situation very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a genuine friend of Israel, I would like to say that the Israeli Government and the Israeli Parliament must be treated in the same way as any other government or parliament. Israel rightly claims to be a democracy. Therefore, it must also accept criticism when we feel that it is appropriate to give it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to add that I do not understand why the Israeli embassy in Brussels issued a statement to the press yesterday saying that we are discussing a non-existent subject today and that the debate should not take place because of the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to call on the Israeli Government and to make it very clear that we are opposed to all the statements made by the President of Iran concerning the security of Israel, that we are opposed to terrorism of whatever kind and that when Israelis are killed in Hebron, we will issue a strong condemnation. However, we must also say to Israel that settlement building must not restart after 26 September. Instead, Israel must lay the foundations for the continuation of the peace process. Israel has a great responsibility in this area and we hope very much that there will be a stable and lasting peace in which both Israel and the Palestinian state have secure borders. The dignity of both the Israelis and the Palestinians is important.</p>

      <p sl="de">It was my intention to welcome, and indeed endorse, his declaration that we should be prepared to support the principle of transparency in the funding of organisations. We would expect that here, and why not in Israel too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then my eyes turned to one of the last paragraphs of his letter, where he expressed his resentment to any comparison being made between pluralistic Israeli civil society and some other countries. He uses these words: ‘Embarking on such a wrong path may lead us all to dwell on Europe’s own credentials past and present’. If that is not a reference to the Holocaust, I do not know what is. The implications are clear: you Europeans do not have the right to criticise Israel because of your past. You have blood on your hands.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was not responsible for the actions of the Nazis. I was not born at the time, most of the rest of us here were not born then, and this European Union was established to try and ensure that evil of that kind never took place again. I resent the idea that we have to turn a blind eye to Israel’s appalling behaviour – in Gaza, the economic blockade, the occupation of Palestinian territory and infringements of human rights – all too often.</p>
      <p sl="de">I resent the idea that we should be forced not to ask why a people which suffered so much in previous centuries should now inflict such suffering upon the Palestinian people today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying that today’s debate is no longer topical. However, while pressure groups have been attacking European funding for Israeli NGOs since 2005, the working conditions of civil society in Israel continue to deteriorate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the publication of the Goldstone report, many representatives of organisations have been defamed, intimidated and arrested. Fourteen draft bills are currently under discussion. They all have the aim of restricting independence and freedom of association. I would remind you that Israeli defenders of human rights are no longer allowed to enter the occupied territories without a permit from the army.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Israeli democrats and pacifists, who have been able to benefit from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, are concerned, because even in an amended form, this draft bill specifically targets the financing of international organisations while private funding is not affected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will no longer accept that those people who have the courage to denounce the daily humiliations suffered by Palestinians, the expulsion of families, demolition of houses, land confiscation and water deprivation, should be reduced to silence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like all sovereign states, Israel has an absolute right to supervise, monitor and regulate as it sees fit the activities of domestic and international NGOs which operate on its territory, particularly if they are of a political nature and might be supportive of terrorism or coming from states which support terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Israel is a parliamentary democracy, characterised by a vigorous civil society in which all shades of non-violent opinion can be openly represented and discussed. NGOs operating in Israel have a freedom unparalleled anywhere else in the Middle East, which is generally a repressive environment for civil society. Russia has passed draconian legislation against NGOs, despite being a member of the Council of Europe, but Russia is big and has oil and gas, whereas Israel is small and resource-poor, which perhaps explains why Russia largely escapes scrutiny in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s debate therefore appears suspiciously like another Israel-bashing exercise by the usual suspects, of the kind in which this Parliament indulges all too often – never mind that the draft law proposed to the Knesset has undergone considerable alteration and improvement. With direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians having just resumed, we in the European Parliament risk condemning ourselves to irrelevance with unhelpful debates like this one.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the proposed bill is in keeping with the broader strategy to de-legitimise the fight to defend human rights in Israel, by muzzling dissenting voices within the country and supplementing similar acts of intimidation, such as arrests at demonstrations against the war in Gaza, in the past.</p>
      <p sl="el">Last May, the Directorate General of External Relations found that the conditions of NGOs in Israel had deteriorated. However, since then, not once has the European Union publicly condemned the decisions on the proposed legislation, nor has it called publicly on Israel to respect the freedom of expression of its citizens. The European Union cannot declare allegiance to the rule of law and recognise the dangers and yet turn a blind eye when human rights are not respected. It must take a public stand by calling on Israel to withdraw the bill.</p>
      <p sl="el">At a time when NGOs being funded by the European Union are under attack and their financial support from the Community is being undermined, the European Union cannot continue to strengthen relations with Israel. It must set conditions for continuing trade and suspend the association agreement until such time as the state of Israel respects freedom of expression and partnership. Moreover, Israel must comply with Article 2 of the association agreement on human rights and withdraw the proposed bill.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is a curious debate, in more ways than one. To sum it up in one sentence: on the basis of outdated parliamentary questions, we are debating a current Israeli legal procedure which seeks to ensure that Israeli NGOs are as financially transparent as possible. Please bear in mind that the draft bill that is being challenged carefully weighs up the right of organisations to operate freely in a democracy against the right of Israeli citizens to know who is funding the activities of the NGOs in question. For many years, transparency has been a European political motto. Is there any reason why this so frequently professed principle should not be properly applied to a situation where the European Union and its Member States grant substantial amounts of money to Israeli NGOs? If this House is opposed to that, then it is, in my opinion, putting up a poor show, both here in Parliament and in the Jewish state. With such a politically suspect attitude, you will certainly alienate the right-minded citizens of Europe, and that means the taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am deeply disturbed by the content and tone of some of the contributions to this debate today. As direct talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority make a faltering start, I would urge this House to be cautious in its remarks, at a time of great sensitivity in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the experience of my own constituency of Northern Ireland, I can testify to the fragility of such talks. Outside interference is often counter-productive and destabilising to progress. This is made all the more acute by the indiscriminate attack last week which killed four Israeli citizens. I am sure Members will join in condemning that attack, and indeed in commending Israel for its commitment to the talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the legislation in question, we should acknowledge that the Israeli Government has worked with its Parliament to address concerns. The bill that will progress through the Knesset has seen significant changes. Those changes exemplify Israeli democracy in action and responsiveness to reasonable and measured criticism. The remaining measures are focused on applying the principles of openness, accountability and transparency to the NGO sector. NGOs across the world regularly advocate these as key principles for healthy public life in a democratic society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the requirement that foreign government support should be acknowledged in public advertising campaigns and websites is comparable with the EU funding requirement to acknowledge and promote the receipt of EU funding. I would suggest that this makes the opposition by NGOs – and by some within this Parliament – to such proposals both illogical and hypocritical.</p>
      <p sl="en">That debate represents interference in the internal affairs of a state outside the European Union and on a matter which is already being addressed. Many in Israel will conclude that the motivation for this is born of anti-Israeli sentiment when, at a time of peace negotiations, we should be a source of encouragement for those negotiators.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, listening to this debate I would like to share with you that for many years, I was Director-General of a Polish NGO which promoted Poland’s joining the European Union, supported a ‘yes’ in the referendum and ran many programmes on political education, democracy, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also had our sponsors in Poland and abroad. They were private persons, businesses and political foundations, as well as various European Union programmes, and, of course, we were obliged to declare the sources of our money and the sums received. This was also true for all money we got from the EU budget. It would never occur to me to see this as any kind of discrimination or as hampering us in any way.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to this discussion, I am sorry to say we are losing ourselves in debates that are based on outdated documents. We are losing the big picture, and that is what we really need. This is about standards, this is about democracy, the democracy based on active citizens often organised in lively, dynamic NGOs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transparency is a standard of democracy, and a bill or any legal document that requires transparency for any private or public funding should be praised, and not condemned, in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">Maybe rather, we should also encourage reporting on private donors. Why should transparency hamper activity, weaken the situation of NGOs, discriminate? Why do we need transparency? These are the questions we should ask ourselves for any organisation in the world that we support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Israel is a democratic state. There was a lively discussion in the Knesset about this draft bill, which resulted in last August’s bill. So, thanking Commissioner Füle for all the information that he has provided us, I can only wish him, the Commission and all of us, further continuing, developing, good cooperation between the European Union and Israel.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, could I first of all respond to the notion that outside interference is in some way damaging to peace processes. If one were to follow that logic, the European Union, and indeed the world at large, should turn its back on every single conflict around the world and pretend it is none of its business. That is a nonsense argument, Mrs Dodds, and I urge you to review your view on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is entirely legitimate for this Parliament to examine potential threats to freedom of speech and freedom of association in any state with which we have a trading relationship. Our treaties oblige us to engage in trade on an ethical basis. Israel, which has a very close trade relationship with the EU, cannot be exempt from such scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the changes that have been made so far to the NGO funding bill in the Knesset law committee, owing no doubt to the international pressure that has been mounted, but it is still only at the first stage. It still has to go back to committee and go through a second and a third stage. We do not yet know what the final version will be like.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the bill as it remains is a draconian and unbalanced bill which will discriminate in favour of private donations from foreign entities, which will not have to disclose the source or purpose of such donations. Either this is a bill about transparency, or it is not. If it is, then it has to be complete transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sceptical regarding the final outcome and believe that Parliament, the Commission and the Council must maintain their vigilance and make it clear that legislation, if passed, which goes beyond balanced transparency requirements will have a bearing on our relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to comment briefly on the proposed boycott legislation, which will attempt to criminalise anybody who supports a boycott of the sale, in Europe, of goods produced illegally in the illegal settlements.

As chair of the Israel Delegation, I was informed of that earlier this week, but what has struck me – and that is where I have a question for you – is that you say that those amendments were the result of outside pressure. Are you suggesting that our colleagues in the Knesset are not entitled to change their minds, as the chair of the committee concerned did when he proposed that private donors also come under the transparency act? Surely, that is the opposite of external pressure? In other words, do you think that external pressure is the only thing that can make members of the Israeli Knesset change their minds?

I know that to be the case in Ireland. In the peace process in Ireland, it helped to change the minds of the IRA and of Sinn Féin.

      <p sl="fr">What are we talking about? What is on the agenda? Not the Goldstone report. Not the settlements. Not operation ‘Cast Lead’. No, the title of the debate is ‘Draft bill on Israeli NGOs’, a bill which is still under debate in the Knesset, which has not yet voted on it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Parliament therefore demanded, back in April, to debate this issue immediately after it had been raised by the Israeli Government, and even before the Israeli Members of Parliament were able to debate it. It is all the more patronising – I am sorry but that is the only word for it – given that this bill, and this has already been mentioned, has now been substantially amended. Indeed, it is an insult to the work of our colleagues in the Knesset to think that it was our oral question here, in this Parliament, that transformed matters. It shows a total lack of understanding of the Israeli mentality and of the vitality of the democratic process, of the NGOs, and of the Israeli Members of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Pöttering mentioned a visit which he has just made to Israel. I too have returned from Israel; I returned on Saturday. I met elected representatives from Kadima, from Labour, and some from Likud, and I can assure you that they have been working with the NGOs for months on this issue. They have not waited for us. So, I do not understand: every democracy in the world – and this has also been said – is moving towards more transparency, ethical conduct and accountability in public office. This is true of governments, political parties – obviously – public administration, the Member States too, the Commission and our Parliament; they all follow the same process of transparency, a process which is all the more necessary and understandable in the case of a region as troubled as this one is by the tragic conflict taking place there.</p>

The new bill calls for total transparency regarding funding from abroad for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in Israel, some of which, it has to be said, are more involved in politics than in humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="it">This call for transparency does not appear to me to restrict people’s freedom of association, but today we are discussing it as if it did. We should not be surprised, then, at the diffidence of Israeli politicians towards the European Union, and that may account for why we are not sitting at the Israeli-Palestinian negotiating table, even though we are the main donor in the region.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should instead be discussing how to improve the transparency and traceability of our procedures for financing the NGOs and United Nations agencies operating in the region. By doing so, we would remove any doubts about our political positions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in February 2010, the Knesset passed an act which abolished the tax exemption enjoyed by all organisations working with foreign groups. This was followed in April by a bill which aims to ban all non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in legal proceedings abroad against Israeli officials. It is obvious that critics of the system soon become public enemy number one in Israel. The New Israel Front is being publicly accused of having destroyed the foundations of the Israeli state, simply because it helped to produce the Goldstone report.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must take up a clear position with regard to this growing intolerance. In Israel and in the Palestinian state, NGOs are an important part of the citizens’ involvement in politics and, therefore, deserve protection as part of a democratic system.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have learnt, to my astonishment, that Israel has been attempting to keep this issue off the European agenda. I always go by the principle that, if you believe in your own legislation, you should not be afraid of debate and that debate can create a climate in which NGOs, which are the issue at stake here, can go about their work in Israel without obstruction. Therefore, a debate in this House can only help dispel concerns.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am pleased to note that a great deal has happened in the period between Mrs Heidi Hautala submitting an oral question on 27 April and today’s debate. I understand from the ambassador’s letter and the translation of the draft bill that significant amendments have been made. I am pleased that is the case. However, what does worry me is how the new legislation will be enforced and the question of whether or not it will be enforced selectively. In my opinion, the transparency of NGOs is part and parcel of every democracy, which is why it is important that Israel, too, ensures that there are no unreasonable obstructions to their activities. I am putting this question to Mr Füle: do we have guarantees that all NGOs in Israel will be treated equally and that this new legislation will not lead to restrictive measures for NGOs which are, wholly or partly, funded from abroad?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My third point concerns transparency, which is being used as an argument – and that is all well and good – but what I do not understand is why private donations do not fall within this legislation. The way I see it, that is a significant omission.</p>

Today we were supposed to discuss our proposals and our views on a bill which is still being amended, and where we might suggest to our colleagues from the Israeli Knesset, who are just as much elected as we are in the European Parliament, what our good advice might be or our valuable experience in the passing of this type of law.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Unfortunately, this discussion has degenerated into a kind of fight by one section of this Parliament against Israel in general. We should remember that Israel finds itself in a very difficult position and a difficult situation, that it is the only democratic state in that region, and that it faces attacks from almost all of its neighbours. That is the first thing, and just to clear up any doubts, in the previous election period, I was the deputy chair of the delegation of the European Parliament for relations with Israel. I therefore have some experience, and very good experience too, I must say, with colleagues from the Israeli Knesset, and I never had the feeling that when we visited Israel and we had questions that were perhaps not agreeable to them, that they did not want to answer those questions. Finally, many of you who are also sitting here in this debate worked together with me in that Delegation, or are even doing so today. So let us move on, let us come forward with some good proposals and, in my opinion, our colleagues from the Knesset will embrace those proposals and will be happy to adopt the act in that way.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the previous speech brought to mind an email that we received a while ago from an American-Israeli friendship organisation saying that it was now high time that people started to treat Israel as a democracy. It reminded me of the well-known story about Gandhi, who was once asked what he thought of Western civilisation. He answered: ‘That would be a good idea’. I think we should treat Israel as if it is a democracy and make the demands that are necessary for it to be a good democracy.</p>
      <p sl="da">The point has been made clearly here today that we cannot simply be satisfied with transparency with regard to public funding when we do not have it with regard to private funding, even if everyone knows where the large private funds come from. We cannot take Israel seriously if they cite the persecution of Jews and the holocaust as an excuse for treating others badly. This trivialising of the suffering of Jews is, in my view, perhaps one of the most disgraceful things we have heard in this debate. Those violent acts that were committed must not be used as an absurd excuse for not complying with the important ground rules of democracy. We must make appropriate demands of Israel and not treat it like a camp for delicate children or make allowances for it as if it is in some way handicapped.</p>

      <p sl="cs">This question to the Commission from the Members on the left is, so to speak, off message and therefore nonsensical. It is not only that the bill the Knesset will vote on next month currently has a different form. I firmly believe that a democratically functioning country such as Israel has the right to pass laws, as long as they are not contrary to international law, and that was not the case even with the original government proposal. I would like to remind you that in my country, it is standard practice for voluntary organisations to name their sources, including sources from foreign and private sponsors.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Union cofinances non-governmental organisations all over the world and we are not always sure what the support is eventually used for. On the other hand, we should therefore applaud the fact that the Israeli Government and parliament are trying to achieve greater transparency in relation to the financial sums flowing into political movements and politically active non-governmental organisations from abroad. We should rather be concerned that some of them use resources from terrorist organisations abroad to undermine peace efforts and threaten the security of Israeli citizens.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am sorry that some Members on the left are bothered about the idea of good relations between Israel and the European Union. Our priority, however, is peaceful coexistence between Israel and the future Palestinian state, and not the spreading of prejudice and gossip.

      <p sl="it">Such objections are understandable, but there are at least two basic reasons why this debate is necessary. The first is the unique nature of the situation in the Middle East, resulting from a conflict that has lasted too long and does not only involve Israel. The second is the important role played by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in that area, both on the humanitarian aid side and in connection with development cooperation policies. Besides, the Israeli authorities themselves should assess that role carefully, because without the work done by all the NGOs, the tensions in the region would be greater and much more serious.</p>
      <p sl="it">For that reason, it will be perfectly natural to suggest to the Knesset, when it intends to legislate on this subject, that it should set out two clear objectives in addition to the changes already made: to ensure transparency for funding, applying without bias to everyone, including organisations like the settlers’ NGOs, for example; and to make it possible in practical terms for all the NGOs to work, since their work is important, not least for the future of the peace negotiations themselves.</p>

In Finland, for example, we have just passed a law about the funding of political parties by means of which we wanted to prohibit all kinds of foreign funding except from European sister-parties. We do not want foreign forces to be able to buy influence in Finnish political life.</p>
      <p sl="en">All us politicians would be very astonished if some fellow European Member State government started funding our national NGOs for political campaigns. At least we would like to know the source of the money and the possible motives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Quartet representative, Tony Blair, pointed out the double standards so commonly applied in European attitudes towards Israel in his speech last week in Herzliya. He said, do not apply rules to the government of Israel that you would never dream of applying to your own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the European Parliament should support Israeli legislators in ensuring transparency rather than attacking with false accusations, and interfering in, a democratic legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are we, as Europeans, fully aware that EU-funded NGOs’ projects do not always promote peace, but rather work against mutual understanding and create more distrust and hostility between Israelis and Palestinians?</p>
      <p sl="en">So this new legislation is important for European taxpayers as well, so that we will know how our money is spent in that area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, they say that before signing an agreement with a bank, you should read the small print at the bottom. In the question we are discussing, today, it is important to read what is said at the very end of the question. The authors ask how this matter will affect the future of the relationship between the EU and Israel. My answer is that it will have a very favourable influence, because we are saying, today, that we have a partner in the Middle East which is a democracy, and that there are people there who want to be careful with European money and who want to take care over how that money is spent. It is the only country in the region where they are so careful about European money. Not far from that country, millions of euro are disappearing without trace, and we do not know how this money is being spent. If, today, we can feel a moment of satisfaction, it is because we are promoting democracy in Israel. We are saying that it is a democratic country, and that it is building a democracy in accordance with our standards. The European Parliament has achieved something exceptional during this debate. In good faith, we have defended non-governmental organisations in Israel – organisations which do not feel they are in any danger – and we are protecting them from legislation which has not yet come into force. I would like this to be seen as a good message from this debate.</p>

      <p sl="sl">The trend of restrictive legislation in Israel points to an ever widening gulf between Israel’s ideal of being the only real democracy in the Middle East, as we proudly like to point out, and the actual situation which, despite all this undeniable democracy, also includes suppression of the legitimate rights of the neighbouring Palestinian population to self-determination and to their own country and freedom.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since this is the policy of the Israeli Government, anyone who opposes it, whether an individual or a non-governmental organisation, will sooner or later become an enemy of its dictatorship. It is difficult, impossible, to be a democracy behind high walls while, at the same time, oppressing others. That is an illusion.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This is why Israel will have to make a choice between remaining a democracy and developing democratically – in the sense of recognising and allowing its neighbouring population, the Palestinians, to exercise their democratic rights – and maintaining its current policy of undermining those rights and occasionally sliding into undemocratic behaviour, lack of openness, narrow-mindedness, xenophobia and repression of its civil society. Unfortunately, the inevitable price of such a policy towards the Palestinians will be the destruction of Israel’s own democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Füle for the words he very clearly expressed about Israeli civil society – which is very vibrant, as we all know – but also for his criticism of the law that has been changed.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the points that I found very positive in the process that has been going on is that some of the very bad parts of the law actually have been changed. However there are still some issues that might need closer review by the Members of the Knesset. You mentioned one of them – the fact that private funding is not part of the law where transparency is required. We know very well – in our countries as well – that there is private funding and there should be transparency. Somebody else said that political parties should be open about which private individuals, companies, etc. are funding them. In my own country, there are problems about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is an issue that, in all friendship with Israel and the Knesset, I hope will still be changed so that civil society in Israel will be as transparent as most of it is anyway, but will also be active in the future for peace in the region.</p>

Furthermore, now that I have spoken to a number of contacts in Brussels, I firmly believe that they did take place.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Here, today, we are debating one particular law. However, there are actually three laws which, each in their own way, essentially place NGOs and anyone working with them in an equivocal position. That is not good for any democracy.

      <p sl="de">Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have, for many years, been required to disclose their sources of funding in a completely transparent way and even to publish this information on their websites. The planned legislation, even in its watered-down form, is ultimately aimed only at specific NGOs: firstly at human rights organisations and secondly at those which receive public funding. This includes, for example, public money from the United Nations or the European Union. In contrast, far-right groups or non-governmental organisations which are privately funded and which, for example, support the building of illegal settlements, are not subject to any legal restrictions and do not have to make their funding sources public. The problem with the proposed legislation lies in this unequal treatment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jordan River is a major asset of not only environmental, but also agricultural and economic significance for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the degradation it is suffering cannot fail to worry us.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is important to point out that roughly 98% of the 1.3 billion cubic metres of natural fresh water in the lower course of the river is diverted away every year, and long stretches of the river are at risk of running dry. This is devastating not only in terms of biodiversity, but above all in terms of local communities’ access to sources of water. Several international actors, including the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the United States Senate, have addressed the situation of profound degradation of the Jordan River.</p>
      <p sl="it">We, too, must demand intervention, not only from the local governments and authorities, but also from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to provide technical and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the river. In particular – as stated in the joint resolution signed by all the political groups, whom I thank for their wholehearted support – we must ask the Commission to insert a clear, specific reference to this project in the action plans of the neighbourhood policy with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
      <p sl="it">An initial step could be to set up a joint study on the situation of the Jordan River. We are well aware that water is a precious, inalienable asset, so I would like to point out that distributing the water fairly means paying equal attention to the demands of all the communities in the region. This is a matter of supreme importance if we want to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have been watching the resumption of peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in recent days with some hope, as these negotiations have identified water resource management as one of their essential points. We hope that the governments, local communities and civil society organisations in the countries and territories involved will begin to cooperate effectively as soon as possible in order to save the lower Jordan. This is a duty not only because of the high symbolic value of this river but, above all, in order to improve the living conditions of the local communities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to discuss the critical situation of water in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union considers water to be a serious concern in the region and I fully share the concerns of the honourable Members of this House, as this region is characterised by water scarcity, water stress and the deterioration of the quality of water, which are likely to be further aggravated by climate change effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware of the impacts this can have on the people in the region, the environment and regional security. The European Union considers that water is a peace priority in the region and this regional challenge requires a regional solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are fully aware, the European Union has been involved in encouraging urgent steps towards a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, where water is one of the ‘final status issues’ to be resolved, along with borders, refugees, Jerusalem and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union recognises the specific situation of the lower Jordan River Basin and the need for more efficient water management including its tributaries. We are therefore engaged in a range of activities at national, sub-regional and regional level with all neighbouring parties. We are supportive of water reforms and policies that encourage the application of sustainable water management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the European Neighbourhood Policy and other measures, the European Union is supporting confidence-building measures, promoting cross-border cooperation and bringing together water resource communities that have shared water concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">European Union activities target capacity-building of different water authorities and users, the collection and sharing of data, the availability of treated waste water, water conservation measures, including water networks, and efficient irrigation systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">European Union efforts address both the demand and supply side of the water sector and establish the conditions that will enable an integrated management of water resources in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is not alone in its efforts. Member States and other donors are active and we closely coordinate our activities with them in order to ensure complementarity.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is taking a very positive step in highlighting the challenge which the Jordan River represents today. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has drafted a special study on the Jordan River and the Jordan Valley and has called in its resolutions for them to be protected, because the Jordan River is a monument of our global heritage, a religious and cultural symbol for millions of people around the world and an ecological, tourist and economic fund for the area.</p>
      <p sl="el">The aim, therefore, today is to highlight its problems and the need for action to protect it, to step up efforts being made by the European Union – the Commission referred to these efforts and we have touched on them on other occasions during work on the common position – and to call for regional cooperation on fair access for the peoples of the countries on the banks of the Jordan River and for shared responsibility for its protection.</p>
      <p sl="el">The motion for a resolution also highlights best practices, such as the special master plan prepared by Israel, which calls for an exchange of best practices and an exchange of expertise, because the Jordan River is a collective issue for the area. Importantly, the real risks are also highlighted: not only the lack of water, not only pollution, but also the loss of biodiversity and the risk of its drying out unless something is done.</p>
      <p sl="el">In order to highlight this international and regional cooperation, the motion proposes a special committee for the Jordan Valley, in which the countries directly affected by the Jordan (Israel, Palestinian Territories, Jordan) can participate, together with other countries in the area, where the Jordan rises, which also have a share of responsibility, such as Lebanon and Syria. I believe that this resolution will gain the support of plenary and the message that the European Parliament sends out will be a well-formed, targeted and strong message.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as has been said, the situation concerning the Dead Sea and the Jordan River is extremely worrying since it is predicted that, if nothing changes in 2011, the river will simply run dry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If no action is taken at international and at regional level to put a stop to this development, the situation will result in an extraordinarily important loss for cultural heritage, for biodiversity – Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou mentioned this point – and also for the security and the economy of the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to bring to your attention an NGO which has taken what I consider to be an absolutely remarkable initiative. This NGO, Friends of the Earth Middle East, has decided to bring together the Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli mayors who live along the river, to rally them and encourage them to think about what they could do to improve matters somewhat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The association and the mayors have carried out some interesting studies concerning the measures that each country could take and the impact those measures would have. They range from waterless toilets to changes in agricultural methods, to changes in the types of crops grown because they absorb too much water, and so on. There is a wide range of measures that can be taken. So this is not a political debate, even though we are well aware that, as soon as we talk about water in the region, things become political.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that everyone could support that, and I would like Europe and the Commission to take inspiration from the very clear conclusions of this report in the relations they have with these countries, particularly through the action plans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, there is one short paragraph that I set great store by – paragraph E – which says that there is overexploitation of water by the Israeli settlers. This is true; it has been confirmed by reports by the World Bank and by Amnesty International. It takes us back to the heart of politics, but it is a truth that must sometimes be told. We have not placed it at the heart of the resolution but we do set great store by it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as the Vice-President of the Euromed Assembly’s Committee on Energy, Environment and Water, I had the opportunity to see the concrete and dramatic ecological reality of the Jordan River area during a field visit which took place last February.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Special Report on the Situation in the Jordan Valley, for which I was rapporteur, highlighted the fact that all parties concerned – in particular, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan, but also Lebanon and Syria – must find a common solution to the two most pressing problems: an equal distribution of water that respects the need of all the people in the region, and a healthy and protected environment for the generations to come.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first step identified in our report is that Israel and the Palestinian Authorities have to agree together on common data concerning available water distribution and demographics as a starting point for further negotiations, since both sides as well as independent reports have presented different figures up to now.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of our main conclusions was that, in order to solve the water problem by cooperation, it is necessary to implement plans for a joint administration, decision making on an equal footing, and the joint management of water resources in the region. I believe that the recommendations in our report match areas where the European Union has a real expertise and could be involved as an active player, paving the way for future partnership between the parties involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I would like to remind you that, while efforts are being made to resume the discussion towards an overall peace agreement, we have the responsibility not to use the situation in the Jordan Valley for political and ideological purposes.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I totally agree with the two previous speakers, but I would like to take the opportunity to say that I believe that very many people here fail to see how impossible it is to insist that the Palestinians bear their share of the responsibility. They do not have the opportunity to do so. How many people here are aware that, since 1967, 50% of the banks of the Jordan on the West Bank have been occupied by Israeli settlements? 50%! On top of that, 45% has been requisitioned as military areas and nature reserves. They have quite simply been shut out. The awful thing for the Palestinians – particularly in the Jordan Valley – is that because we have not seen forceful resistance from them, they have simply been forgotten. If there is no military action, if nothing dramatic happens, they are simply forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is, of course, a horrible lesson that we are teaching the poor Palestinians in particular – that they need to get themselves noticed – and loudly even. This problem needs to be solved. However, we must not forget that if possible – if possible – the suffering of the Palestinians is even worse in this area than in the rest of the West Bank, and that, as the situation currently stands, they do not have the chance to live up to the responsibility they ought to be taking. Thus, there needs to be an integrated solution, and we therefore also need to consider the political picture. It is not only Israel, it is not only Syria and it is not only Jordan – no! However, the Palestinians cannot be involved as long as they have no possibility of getting involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, water is indeed a sensitive and potentially inflammatory issue in the Middle East. High-level delegations from Israel and the Palestinian Authority are currently discussing water rights as part of the comprehensive framework for peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the Quartet, the EU supports a two-state solution as the ultimate guarantor of peace and stability in the region. Therefore, we must be very careful not to prejudice the delicate negotiations currently under way in Washington. Blaming the Israeli settlers, as Mrs De Keyser seems to be doing, in particular, for Jordan River water overuse, sends precisely the wrong signal to the people of Israel – our democratic ally – about the EU’s professed position as an honest broker.</p>
      <p sl="en">Conserving the watershed of the Jordan River is an important regional issue that is not of course confined solely to Israel and the Palestinians, yet Israel’s opponents in this House and elsewhere are blatantly seeking to exploit this issue as part of their campaign to undermine the Jewish State.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, there is no problem in Mrs De Keyser making a particular assessment, not at all. The fact is, however, that according to the Peace Treaty signed between Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan in 1994, an agreement was reached to cooperate in the ecological recovery of the Jordan River along the shared borders and to protect its water resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">This was an agreement, in addition to others that Israel signed in 1994, with which it is failing to comply. This is the problem we have with Israel: it does not comply with the agreements that it signs.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why it is extremely important that the initiative undertaken by President Chirac in 2008, calling for an initiative for the Jordan River basin, be given substance and supported by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe it very important that a Jordan River basin commission be set up as a trilateral forum to cooperate in the rehabilitation of this river, drawing up and applying water conservation and recovery policies. It is true that, as a result of the failure to comply with the 1994 Peace Treaty, Palestinians have been excluded from the Israeli security area established in the West Bank along the Lower Jordan and that the settlers are illegally occupying land that does not belong to them. Given that the occupation is accompanied by an irregular and illegal use of the water, another problem is being added to the political one, which is the problem of environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="es">As 2011 has been set for the coming into operation of new waste water treatment plants, I hope the European Union will support, promote and encourage the need to set up that Jordan River basin commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Today’s debate on the situation facing the Jordan River is extremely important to the group I belong to and I would like, if I may, to welcome in particular in this Chamber the involvement in this issue of our colleague, Rodi Kratsa, Vice-President of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also like to emphasise, as you are well aware, that environmental protection organisations have long warned about the critical ecological state the Jordan River is in. This is a river which seems to be dying from what is tantamount to general indifference.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I have read in the press that, in spite of the extremely critical conditions, Christians, particularly Orthodox, continue to be baptised in the Jordan River.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, there is a danger that the river will run dry in 2011, which would have drastic repercussions for the region’s already fragile ecosystem, especially for the Dead Sea. This means that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, Jordanians and Israelis will be affected by an ecological disaster.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, apart from the ecological aspect – as other of my fellow Members have also highlighted in this Chamber – which is an aspect that certainly needs to be tackled urgently with EU help, the Jordan River’s situation is also particularly important as a factor for promoting regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that we must avoid a situation where its waters are used unilaterally, with total disregard for the region’s water supply security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Cooperation among the states bordering the river and local communities is therefore paramount to rehabilitating this resource which is vital for economic development. This can enable the Jordan to become a symbol again of cooperation and coexistence, including from a cultural perspective, if there is strong political will to do so.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, could I suggest to Mr Tannock that it is not helpful at all to ignore the reality that settlers deliberately choose sites where they have good water supply, and that this in turn deprives Palestinians of that water supply. They are not the only problem in relation to water in the area, but they certainly do play a role in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Jordan, unfortunately, is being deprived of something like 98% of its flow because it has been diverted by other states, including Israel. It is a transboundary river, with something like four states, including the Palestinian West Bank, bordering that river. Potentially, if it is handled right and if Europe plays its role properly in the area, it can be a source of reconciliation through the promotion of joint management of what is an important cultural, religious and indeed economic resource for the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">To take the line that you take, Mr Tannock, that everything that involves some minor criticism of Israel is, in some way, an attack on Israel is simply to ignore reality. There are also others there who have diverted water. The Friends of the Earth, for instance, pointed out at a recent seminar organised by my group, the Socialists and Democrats, that the Jordan River once carried an average of 1.3 billion metric metres of fresh water to the Dead Sea. That has now been reduced to 20-30 million annually. By the end of next year, it could be a dead river unless we take action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I want to reject the numerous accusations from outside and, in some cases, from within Parliament, claiming that we are discussing this subject at the wrong time, after the peace talks have begun. The parliamentary question which I helped to draw up was tabled at a time when none of us thought that direct peace talks would start up again. I have been involved in this area since the early 1990s and this subject has been under discussion in Parliament for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is ultimately all about preventing the Lower Jordan River from finally running dry. The lower part of the river has already been reduced to a mere trickle. It consists only of waste water and contains no fresh water at all. All the scientists are agreed that the Lower Jordan River will be as good as dead in one or two years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it disturbing that the resolution addresses Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian Authority on equal terms. The Lower Jordan River area is located entirely in zone C, which means that the Palestinian Authority does not even have a right to access the area, never mind any administrative rights or any influence at all over it. It has already been said that the Palestinian Authority can do nothing in this area. Therefore, this resolution should be aimed at other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">When a country, in this case Israel, uses 75% of the water available in the Lower Jordan River, although part of the water has already been taken by other countries, and leaves almost no water for the Palestinians to live on, this is a political issue. This problem was supposedly resolved in the Oslo II Agreement and we have not made any progress since then.</p>
      <p sl="de">The specific difficulty at the moment is that the Palestinians are constantly attempting to drill wells, which are immediately destroyed, and also that the Israeli water authority, which is a monopoly, is not drilling wells for the Palestinians, but only for the illegal settlements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to start by paying tribute to the coalition of ecologists that we welcomed some months ago in Brussels, an association of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. It drew up some excellent reports on the situation in the region, on the state of the Jordan River, and on the risk of its disappearance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union, which allocates substantial funds to development projects in the Middle East, must play more of a role in drafting and implementing a rescue plan for the river involving all parties in the region. The countries bordering the river, such as Syria, Jordan and Israel, divert the greatest part of it, while the Palestinians – as someone just said – receive only around 5% of the resource.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the Jordan Valley, the Israeli settlers consume six times more water than the Palestinians, particularly through the polluting intensive agriculture intended for the export of agricultural products to Europe. The extension of these settlements with their lush vegetation must stop, as must the destruction of Bedouin camps and their water tanks, which happened again this summer, some weeks ago. It is madness!</p>
      <p sl="fr">The preservation and fair distribution of water in the region must be a priority for us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The environmental disaster under discussion today concerns all of us, as Europeans, although it is occurring outside the area of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The concept of sustainable development in which we believe is one without administrative boundaries or religious creeds. It sees the planet as a whole, not as the sum of its parts. Hence, the Jordan River is a problem for all mankind, not just the people and communities which are directly affected by water shortages or the poor quality of the water. Our good sense tells us to ‘think globally, act locally’. That is what we are here today to do: think globally.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the European Union, we must contribute to acting locally as a way of minimising and reversing the continuing degradation of the flow and quality of the Jordan River. The EU already has a legislative and institutional framework and tools at its disposal in order to act, or help to act. I am talking about the Union for the Mediterranean, its secretariat and the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), managed by the European Investment Bank. This is obviously an issue that the Parliament delegation, which I chair, will follow closely in our relations with the countries of the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is clear than any action leading to the resolution of this environmental tragedy should, in the first instance, be undertaken by the states and local authorities whose people will benefit from it directly. In view of this, I would like to emphasise two ideas that appear in the resolution. The first of these is the creation of a commission for managing the basin of the whole Jordan, made up of representatives of the states or authorities that use its waters. Europe can help here, for example, by sharing the experience of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine. Secondly, best practice can be supported and disseminated on joint Union projects involving Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian people, particularly those backed by the Friends of the Earth in the Middle East, whom Mr De Rossa has already called upon today to help with the efficient and proper management of water resources in the Jordan Valley basin.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Mr President, and in an even broader context, I would like to highlight the example of cooperation and peaceful coexistence that this plan represents. At a time when we are welcoming and encouraging the return of the new process of direct dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, albeit while lamenting the absence of the EU in the process, we welcome the direct involvement of both parties.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The issue of the drying up of the Jordan River is undoubtedly a serious regional environmental problem which affects the ecosystem of the whole area and the life and health of its inhabitants. Long-term excessive extraction of water, along with pollution and drought, are the main reasons for the situation, as is an inability to ensure effective water management.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As some Members have already said, more than 90% of the flow of the river is extracted for supplies of drinking water and especially for agricultural irrigation and industry. The annual flow has fallen from a former level of 1.3 billion cubic metres to about 100 million cubic metres. The political conflict clearly makes it more difficult to solve this environmental problem.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, water does not have to be a source of conflict. It can also be an example of positive practical cooperation in the region and it can play a key role in building mutual trust. Peace based on everyday cooperation and shared values has a greater chance than any solution from a round table.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive drying-up of the Jordan River is a direct consequence of the tragedy that Palestine is experiencing. Water is a highly political issue. Let us not forget that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us remember some facts: the World Bank informs us that, for two years, the one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been without chlorine, which is essential for disinfecting the water; 50% of homes did not have access to water before the bombings of January 2009, so imagine what it is like now. Médecins sans Frontières say that, now, following the attacks by the Israeli army on the infrastructure, 90% of the water supplied to the inhabitants is unfit for human consumption. Every day, 80 million litres of untreatable sewage is discharged into our Mediterranean as a result of the destruction inflicted on the infrastructure in Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that Baroness Ashton has visited Gaza on several occasions, but where is the political courage to apply to Israel the same standards as we have in Europe? Must clean water, like the land, be monopolised by the Israeli settlers? Consequently, the European Union must suspend the association agreement with the current Israeli Government, which remains deaf to all our requests, whilst the occupation and the settlements, which are illegal, remain. Without justice, there will be no peace.</p>

      <p sl="sk">As we have heard many times in today’s debate, and we will surely hear again, the Jordan River is of unimaginable cultural, environmental and economic significance, as well as political and strategic significance, of course. The exploitation and misuse of the river is therefore unacceptable. Since 1964, its flow has been diverted to Israel and also to other countries: to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and other countries that have been mentioned here. Many of these countries are destroying the river and polluting it. According to conservationists, the misuse of the Jordan has almost destroyed its entire ecosystem. Recovery from its current state would take decades.</p>
      <p sl="sk">According to estimates, the Jordan River is one of the hundred most threatened places in the world from an environmental perspective. Of course, that fact is also due to a situation where Israel and the surrounding Arab states are incapable of agreeing on the conservation and protection of the river, and I therefore firmly believe that the European Union should and must get involved in this process very actively, by making financial assistance for development projects in middle eastern areas dependent on renewing the lower flow of the river, for example.</p>

      <p sl="en">The rehabilitation of the Jordan River and the cooperation required to achieve it might just enhance the prospects of peace too. That river has been immortalised in the holy books of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, with references associating it with the prophets Moses and Elijah, and as the burial place of four companions of the prophet Mohammed. The Jordan River was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua, and it is here that the miracle took place of Jesus walking on the water.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Water resources are a delicate subject in the Middle East and should be discussed towards the end of the negotiations to avoid any damage to the peace process. The EU must avoid needlessly turning this into a political issue and encourage the signing of a regional agreement on the Jordan River’s rehabilitation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As I regard the Jordan River as a regional issue, I welcome the continuing cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian authorities on managing the water. The joint contribution of both states has resulted in the recent approval of 61 of the 96 projects proposed with this in mind. Nevertheless, the problem of insufficient water resources is still unresolved.</p>

If the salvage project succeeds, this will have a knock-on effect on all the other aspects. In this regard, I think that paragraph E in the draft resolution is not linked directly to the subject in question, which may create unwanted confusion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union can and must make a considerable contribution to anticipating the adverse impact which the famous river’s total degradation and, ultimately, disappearance may have.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we know that the Jordan River plays an important role in Middle Eastern politics because of its location on the borders of various countries. Although the river has helped to bring peace between Israel and Jordan as a result of the treaty which allows Jordan to extract larger quantities of water, in the case of Syria, the situation is reversed. It is an open secret that Israel’s fear that its water could be taken away by Syria is the real reason why Israel refuses to give back the Golan Heights.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the Jordan River really has become a trickle of waste water because of constant water extraction, and this is probably the price that will have to be paid for greening the desert, the situation in the Middle East will undoubtedly deteriorate in the near future, particularly as some of the leaders of Hamas are talking about the liberation of the whole region between the Mediterranean and the Jordan as being a moral and religious duty.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the shortage of water in the Jordan River also has wider repercussions, because as the Jordan dries up the amount of water reaching the Dead Sea is also reduced. Therefore, the potential for conflict and the area of conflict will increase. We should take this into consideration in our Middle East strategy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The following questions are addressed to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 1 by Vilija Blinkeviciute (H-0355/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Disabled people and the Europe 2020 strategy</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Union strategy for jobs and growth over the next decade adopted by the European Council is intended to help Europe recover from the crisis and, by promoting competitiveness, productivity and social cohesion, to strengthen Europe’s role at EU and international level. However, it is highly regrettable that disabled people, who currently constitute over 12% of the EU’s population, have been forgotten in this strategy. Although the Council has constantly called for greater attention to be paid to the integration of disabled people when dealing with disability issues, no specific tasks, objectives or commitments are set out in the Europe 2020 strategy that might form a basis for the improvement of the lives of the more than 65 million disabled Europeans. Almost 78% of disabled people are not integrated into the labour market and have no opportunity to earn a living. Most of them are dependent on benefits, which, sadly, have also been reduced as a result of the recession.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Council intend to guarantee employment for disabled people and their participation in the labour market on equal terms? Does the Council not think it necessary to adopt specific guidelines for disability policy over the next decade or a dedicated strategy with clearly defined objectives and commitments?</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Council is committed to increasing job opportunities and participation in the labour market for all citizens, including people with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of the key objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy approved by the European Council on 17 June 2010 are specifically aimed at disabled persons: they are designed to foster employment, improve educational attainment and promote social inclusion, not least by reducing poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Europe 2020 strategy also specifically refers to persons with a disability in the flagship initiative ‘European Platform against Poverty’. The initiative will have an impact both at EU level in the form of Commission proposals and programmes to combat discrimination, including discrimination against persons with a disability, and at national level. Member States will need to define and implement targeted measures for specific risks groups, such as the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In line with the conclusions of the European Council in June 2010, Member States need to act now to implement these priorities at national level. All common policies are also required to support the strategy. This holistic approach is intended to reduce social exclusion for people with disabilities, an aim which also appears in the resolution on a new European disability framework adopted by the Council in June. The resolution calls on Member States and the Commission to make disability issues an integral part of all flagship initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy and to tap the human capital of people with disabilities, not least by establishing suitable training and employment measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its resolution, the Council also invited the Commission to produce a new European disability strategy for the coming decade in conjunction with the disabled and their representative bodies, building on the Europe 2020 strategy and other key documents.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the case of legislative developments, we need to consider what the Commission can contribute in terms of existing legislation. The Council is essentially seeking to provide active protection for people with a disability in line with its competences as set out in the treaties.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Budgetary adjustment and private debt</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Attempts to achieve financial reform at European level aim to improve public finances and balance Member States’ budgets. At the same time, action is being taken to clean up the wider financial sector, and particularly the banking sector, which is directly linked with the real economy. These efforts, however, are concerned only with the public debt situation, not with private debt, which is the second component of a country’s overall debt. What impact does private debt have on the social situation of each Member State, and what are the links between private and public debt? What does the Council intend to do in the event that (a) private debt is greater than public debt, (b) it is increasing? How will it tackle such a tendency, given that the Stability and Growth Pact does not envisage tackling private debt?</p>

      <p sl="fr">The current macro-economic and budgetary surveillance procedures set out in Articles 121 and 126 of the treaty constitute the cornerstone of economic policy coordination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Council in March 2010 set up a task force chaired by the President-in-Office of the Council and made up of all Member States, the European Commission and the European Central Bank. The task force was charged with analysing the measures needed to create an improved crisis resolution framework and better budgetary discipline by exploring all the options for strengthening the legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The task force presented a progress report to the European Council in June. The report highlighted the need for reinforced budgetary surveillance, notably with a greater emphasis on debt levels and trends, but also taking into account the overall sustainability of that debt in the light of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The task force also advocated adopting more effective macro-economic surveillance procedures in order to identify macro-economic imbalances at an earlier stage and then produce recommendations designed to prevent the situation worsening and avoid any knock-on-effects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we will need to define specific indicators, although private debt will undoubtedly be a key issue. The Council meeting on 8 June and the European Council on 17 June approved the task force’s orientations. The task force is due to present its final report and findings at October’s European Council meeting. We will then be able to begin the process of adopting new EU legislative texts or amending existing legislation as appropriate.

      <p sl="unknown">Question 3 by Silvia-Adriana Ticau (H-0361/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: TEN-T network review</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A ministerial conference was held on 7 and 8 June 2010 in Saragossa (Spain), organised by the Commission, with the objective of launching a review process for the TEN-T network. This process will, in principle, take place over the second half of this year and the beginning of next year, and will focus on developing the methodology for defining the nucleus of the TEN-T network and its nodes for interconnection with the transport infrastructures of the EU's neighbours. Following this process, each mode of transport should be able to enhance its contribution to trans-European transport, with intermodality ensured between different forms of transport and, above all, with suitable financing mechanisms in place.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that the greater part of this process will coincide with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, can the Council provide information on the proposed timetable and the actions planned by the Belgian Presidency concerning the review of the TEN-T network?</p>

    <intervention id="3-360" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">The June 2009 Council conclusions welcomed the publication of the Commission Green Paper on a TEN-T policy review for better integration of the trans-European transport network at the service of the common transport policy and called on the Commission to present a proposal to the institutions on amending the TEN-T guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main new feature in the proposal is the two-layered planning approach: there would still be a TEN-T base made up of fairly dense networks of railways, roads, inland waterways, ports and airports which comprise the comprehensive network, most of them part of national networks which would then be subsumed into a central network. This central network would allow for genuine European planning, focusing on steadily increasing the effectiveness of the network resources and achieving a significant overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions linked to transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In June, the Council took note of the information provided by the Presidency and Commission on the results of the TEN-T Days, an annual ministerial conference on the trans-European transport network which was held in Zaragoza on 8 and 9 June 2010. The discussions focused primarily on how to recast the planning and implementation framework for the future TEN-T and on how to mobilise funding effectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is currently engaged in a public consultation exercise on future trans-European transport network policy to develop criteria and conditions for overall and central network planning.

      <p sl="unknown">Question 4 by Georgios Papanikolaou (H-0362/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Evaluation of the Open Method of Coordination</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In 2000, the Council introduced the concept of the Open Method of Coordination in relation to sectors (employment, social protection, social integration, education, youth and training) which fall within the remit of Member States. Its aim was to improve cooperation between Member States and ensure exchanges of best practices in order to bring about the convergence of policies between individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of the above, will the Council say:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does it consider this specific strategy to be successful? Could it provide specific results?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Presidency consider that the concept of the Open Method of Coordination should be re-examined or revised?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-367" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">In its conclusions on 30 November 2009, the Council mentioned the fact that the open method of coordination has actively contributed to the smooth running of the job markets, as well as to social inclusion. The exchange of employment best practice has proved and will, in the future, still prove to be particularly useful. That will require effective monitoring of the employment guidelines that will soon be adopted by the Council, following advice from Parliament - which you have furthermore delivered today – and a key role for the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council in the context of the new governance, which should be decided on by the European Council, in particular, within the framework of the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last year, moreover, when the Council adopted a new strategic framework for European cooperation in the area of education and training, the new members recognised that achieving the main strategic objectives defined in the framework involved effective use of the open method of coordination, which proves that they continue to support this particularly useful method in the areas that fall within their national jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The recent 2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme highlights the considerable progress made, thanks to the open method of coordination in terms of European coordination on education and training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Likewise, in its conclusions of 7 June 2010, the Council drew attention to the interest expressed in the general discussions currently being held on the Europe 2020 strategy in developing the integrated approach fully through joint work at a European level, by using the framework provided by the open method of coordination in the field of social protection and inclusion, as a mechanism that has demonstrated its considerable potential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, faced with the new challenges and perspectives offered by the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular, with regard to monitoring the implementation of the objective defined by the European Council on poverty reduction and social aspects of the employment guidelines, in particular guideline 10, the Presidency, during the informal, meeting of the ministers of social affairs on 9 July, invited the Member States to launch a process of reflection on strengthening the open method of coordination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its resolution of November 2009, which establishes a renewed framework for European cooperation in the area of youth 2010-2018, the Council has already set out a certain number of general principles that must be observed in all the policies and activities relating to young people, within the framework of a renewed and more integrated method of coordination. To this end, the Presidency will organise a conference on 14 September and the EPSCO Council of 21 October should, at the Presidency’s initiative, once again debate this issue and reach some conclusions on the subjects of employment and social inclusion.</p>

      <p sl="el">My question is: could we have a report from time to time on this method so that we can exchange opinions and so that we, too, are informed at political level?

How much impact do you feel the open method of coordination has on poverty reduction and is it enough, shall we say, if we exchange good practice and see how Scandinavian countries pay great attention to combating poverty and social exclusion?

You have just underlined one of the aspects in terms of achieving common objectives on social issues. In general terms, it is true that in terms of growth, employment and the fight against poverty – which is at the forefront in 2010 – active inclusion policies may not only reduce poverty, but increase the supply of labour. The reforms in the pension systems may also raise employment levels and sustain public finances. The same applies to healthcare systems.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 5 by Nikolaos Chountis (H-0366/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Memorandum of Understanding concluded by Greece with the EU and IMF and rocketing inflation</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF and EU signed by Greece specifically states that one of the obligations of the Greek Government is to reduce inflation to below the average for the euro area in order to make its economy more competitive. In May, however, inflation reached 5.4% compared with 1.6% for the euro area, thereby further eroding the disposable income of Greek wage earners and significantly undermining the competitiveness of the Greek economy. This hefty rise in inflation has been caused by increased direct and indirect taxation imposed by the EU and IMF, as well as by ongoing and unrestrained speculation. Does the Council agree that the fiscal measures imposed by the EU and IMF have largely contributed to this inflationary spiral which is further undermining the competitiveness of the Greek economy? What structural measures will it recommend to the Greek Government with a view to containing it?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-373" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">The Council has often emphasised the Greek economy’s long-term structural problems in various multilateral supervision exercises. Along with the excessive deficit procedure, on 16 February 2010, the Council recommended that Greece implement a set of measures to improve the running of the commodity markets and the corporate environment, to sustain the growth in productivity and employment, to improve the efficiency and the rate of absorption of the Union’s structural funds, to correct the country’s excessive budget deficit and ensure the long-term viability of its public finances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Greece presented the first report on the implementation of these measures on 16 March and the second in May. In June, the Commission and the International Monetary Fund carried out a preliminary analysis within the framework of the financial stabilisation mechanism valued at EUR 110 billion, granted to Greece jointly by the Member States of the euro area and the IMF. The analysis was completed in August but the Commission’s final report has not been formally referred to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has notified the Member States in the euro area of the preliminary results of the analysis and if, according to the Commission’s assessment, the economy develops in line with the projections that form the basis of the adjustment programme that backs up the financial stabilisation mechanism, the increase in the inflation rate will have a negative impact on the commodity markets. The Council will therefore monitor the situation carefully and will continue to take appropriate measures to help the Greek authorities to encourage economic growth and maintain a healthy budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the Commission believes that the changes in the economy comply with the underlying projections of the adjustment programme that backs up the financial stabilisation mechanism, the rise in the rate of inflation will, as I was saying, be likely to have a negative impact on the markets. The same goes for the budgetary situation, which the Council will monitor carefully.</p>

      <p sl="el">Minister, I am afraid that you did not answer the question I asked you. The measures imposed on Greece under the Memorandum of Understanding – the procedure which you described in the Memorandum of Understanding with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union – are contradictory. On the one hand, in a bid to generate state revenue, taxes have been imposed, but they cannot be collected, because the workers have no other income, nor do small enterprises, and while talking about reducing inflation, they are planning new revenue-raising taxes by increasing VAT on high-street goods and fuel oil.</p>
      <p sl="el">The question I want to ask you is this: according to my sources, Greece was encouraged at yesterday’s ECOFIN meeting to introduce new revenue-raising taxes and these measures are translating into rocketing inflation. What I want to ask you, therefore, is if the ECOFIN meeting discussed, if the European Union proposed, corrective measures to prevent rocketing inflation in Greece over and above revenue-raising taxes?</p>

      <p sl="fr">I cannot tell you exactly what decision Ecofin has reached over the last few hours, but the Council has indeed repeatedly criticised the Greek economy’s long-term structural problems during various multilateral supervision exercises. In its recommendations on the 2009 implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines by the Member States, the Council noted that Greece must intensify its efforts to rectify the macro-economic imbalances and remedy the structural weaknesses in its economy, in line with the Lisbon strategy for employment and growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council recommends that Greece increases its competitiveness in the professional services sector as well as its investment into research and development, uses the structural funds more effectively, reforms public administration, and takes a series of measures in the labour market within the framework of an integrated strategy on flexicurity.</p>

At the same time, you tell us that there is again talk in the Council of measures and new taxes.</p>

All Member States are supposed to conduct sound national policies, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines.

      <p sl="fr">I wish to point out that following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy represents the Union on matters relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy within international organisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The priorities adopted by the Council focus on the following themes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, promoting a stronger United Nations – the European Union will contribute to building a strengthened multilateral system, in particular, by improving the representation, transparency, responsibility, efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second priority will be to contribute towards international peace and security. The European Union plans to raise the profile of its positions and contributions in terms of crisis management within the relevant United Nations bodies, in particular, at the Security Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third priority theme will include the environment and sustainable development, in particular, with the aim of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth priority concerns human rights. Ever since its inception, the European Union has always been one of the staunchest defenders of human rights and one of the most prominent players in the United Nations system in this area. The European Union will actively encourage the integration of human rights in all aspects of United Nations activity, by reaffirming that human rights are inextricably linked to the UN’s other objectives in terms of security and development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the fifth priority is reforming the United Nations system, with a view to improving the system’s workings, its effectiveness, transparency and representation. As far as the Human Rights Council review is concerned, the European Union is taking part in the formal and informal consultation process. The Union will continue to support the Third Committee’s ability to act, being the only universal body which has the power to implement standards for human rights. This ability should be fully preserved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On the basis of the Commission’s communication entitled ‘Options for an EU vision and target for biodiversity beyond 2010’, on 15 March 2010, the Council adopted conclusions entitled ‘Biodiversity post-2010 – EU and global vision and targets and international access and burden sharing regime’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its conclusions, the Council stated that it is deeply concerned by the fact that the biodiversity 2010 targets have not been achieved, either at European Union level or worldwide, that biodiversity loss continues at an unacceptable rate, and that it has very serious environmental, economic and social consequences. However, the Council stressed that these targets had played a crucial role in generating useful measures in favour of biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council set out a long-term vision according to which, by 2050, biodiversity in the European Union, as well as the ecosystem services it provides, its natural capital, will be protected, valued and appropriately restored, given the intrinsic value of biodiversity and its essential contribution to human well-being and to economic prosperity, and in such a way that the catastrophic changes caused by the loss of biodiversity are avoided.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore the Council laid down a primary objective of curbing biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services in the European Union by 2020 and ensuring their restoration as far as possible, while at the same time strengthening the European Union’s contribution to preventing biodiversity loss on a global scale.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of the European Union’s priorities for protecting and strengthening biodiversity, the Council noted that the destruction, fragmentation and degradation of habitats are the largest pressures on biodiversity. As for the causes of this situation with regard to habitats, the Council highlighted the detrimental change of land use, overexploitation and unsustainable use of natural resources, invasive exotic species, the illegal trade of species threatened with extinction, the acidification of oceans, and obviously pollution. Increasingly also, climate change could even worsen some effects, for instance, the number of species threatened with extinction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the Europe 2020 strategy, the Council’s broad economic policy guidelines call on the Member States and the Union to introduce measures, turn environmental challenges into growth opportunities, and use natural resources more efficiently, thereby also contributing to ensuring biological diversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Biodiversity’s role was also clearly highlighted by the European Council in its March 2010 conclusions, where it said that there is an urgent need to reverse the persistent trend towards biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The European Council endorses the long-term vision for biodiversity by 2050 and the 2020 target set forth in the aforementioned Council conclusions of 15 March 2010.</p>

Now that we are in the final straight, the Presidency is seeking to advance our debate as much as possible. Indeed, it is vital that the realities of today’s CAP and the challenges of tomorrow’s CAP are fully taken into account in this other major debate, on the EU’s budgetary framework for 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you are aware, the future of the CAP will be the main item on the agenda at the informal meeting of EU agriculture ministers, which will take place from 19-21 September in Belgium. The chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, has also been invited to take part in this meeting to lead our informal discussions. This summer, the Presidency has given a great deal of thought to the outcome of the July conference and has drawn up a summary document, which will be finalised in the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report that the Presidency has drawn up, and which we intend to examine in more detail in our forthcoming discussions, confirms the relevance of the CAP’s objectives as defined in the Treaty of Lisbon: to ensure the supply of safe and high quality foods for European citizens, to promote sustainable agriculture throughout Europe, to protect the environment and landscapes, and to contribute to the sustainable development of rural areas, as we discussed in the previous question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to this, the report drawn up by the Presidency also confirms the real added value of a common agricultural policy at European level and the importance of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The forthcoming discussions will be followed, in October, by a final policy debate on the future of the CAP at the Agriculture Council. Thus, the Council, just like the European Parliament, will have significantly contributed to the consultation process. I am certain that the Commission also acknowledges the hard work that has been carried out by the Council and the European Parliament, and I am sure that it will make every effort to present a communication that receives the support of both institutions. Once the communication is available, the Presidency will start discussions in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the negotiations on a free trade agreement with the Mercosur countries, I should firstly like to point out, while acknowledging the vital economic importance of such an agreement, that the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the agriculture ministers, by and large, share the same view on the potential risks that such an agreement will have for the ‘sensitive’ sectors of EU agriculture. You will be aware that, in May, the Council noted the concerns expressed by a significant number of Member States in a joint memorandum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I should like to point out that the Commission must comply with the negotiating mandate. Moreover, in May, Commissioner Cioloş assured the Council that the Commission would make sure that negotiations with Mercosur were in line with the CAP and the fundamental interests of EU agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To sum up, I should like to emphasise that the Council will continue very closely to monitor the discussions with Mercosur, in particular, within the Trade Policy Committee. The next negotiating session is scheduled for October, and I can assure you that the Presidency will see to it that the negotiating mandate is strictly adhered to.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should simply like to point out that, during these negotiations, the Commission is bound by its negotiating mandate and that any positive outcome of these negotiations should benefit EU agricultural production, for example, in terms of promoting and protecting European agricultural products, and particularly in the area of geographical indications.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 9 by Ryszard Czarnecki (H-0379/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Prospects of accession to the EU of Balkan States</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What view does the Council take of the prospects of accession to the European Union of the States in the Balkan region in south-eastern Europe? Does the Council consider that some of these States could accede to the Union during the period covered by the next Financial Perspective, i.e. between 2014 and 2020?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-396" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olivier Chastel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fr">The objective of our policy towards the Western Balkans is to contribute to the stability of the region and to help the countries of the region establish peace, democracy, stability and prosperity in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 1999, the EU decided to implement the Stabilisation and Association Process – the framework for the accession process culminating in the possible accession of these countries – in order to better spread out their preparations for EU membership. These preparations remain essential for the stability, reconciliation and future of the region. They are developing and taking shape in accordance with the Thessaloniki Agenda and with the renewed consensus on enlargement, which lays down fair and rigorous conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council has therefore repeatedly confirmed the European Union’s unwavering commitment to the Western Balkan countries’ preparations for EU membership, including recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June, following the Sarajevo meeting on 2 June.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the years, the EU has signed six stabilisation and association agreements with the region’s countries, four of which have already entered into force. In October 2009, the Commission proposed the start of accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The accession negotiations with Croatia, under way since October 2005, are, for their part, in their final stages. The EU remains politically involved in the process through all of its instruments: three Common Security and Defence Policy missions – two in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one in Kosovo – and three special representatives in Skopje, Priština and Sarajevo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Financial aid will surpass EUR 900 million in 2010 and will reach EUR 1 billion in 2013. In total, since 1991, the European Union has provided the region’s countries with more than EUR 13 billion in financial aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as accession dates are concerned, these depend entirely upon fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and of the conditions laid down in the Stabilisation and Association Process. This process dictates a clear-cut procedure: stabilisation and association agreement, Commission opinion on the application for membership, candidate status, accession negotiations and, finally, accession.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council is eager to progress to the next stages of the process, but it is up to the governments of the region’s countries to respect the conditions laid down, to maintain – or even step up – the pace of the necessary reforms and to rise to the major challenges. The countries of the region should increase their efforts in relation to the fight against corruption and organised crime, administrative capacity building, and the resolution of outstanding issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process will not be accomplished if the people and the governments of the region do not show determination and responsibility in assuming an active role. The future of the region ultimately depends on its people and its governments. Regional cooperation and the policy of good neighbourliness are major factors in the reconciliation and resolution of bilateral disputes. Such policies are at the heart of the EU’s approach towards the region and have been promoted systematically by the EU since 1995. In this context, on 14 June, the Council invited the countries concerned to resolve outstanding issues with neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to conclude by pointing out that, in November 2009, the Council took the decision to permit visa-free travel for citizens of three of the region’s countries and is currently working on an identical decision for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will take this decision this year, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the Council is not currently in a position to comment on the impact of enlargement on the EU’s current budget and the budget for 2014-2020, as it is still awaiting the Commission’s proposal on the next financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Rovana Plumb, Iliana Malinova Iotova, Pervenche Berès, Stephen Hughes, Alejandro Cercas, Gianni Pittella and Jutta Steinruck, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the free movement of workers – temporary restrictions affecting Romanian and Bulgarian citizens on the European Union labour market (O-0096/2010 - B7-0455/2010).</p>

    <intervention id="3-403" speaker_id="38595" name="Rovana Plumb" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Author">
      <p sl="ro">During his State of the Union address, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, stressed that increasing the level of employment across Europe was a priority.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, we have all committed to achieving the objectives of the European Union’s strategy for the next 10 years on increasing the level of employment and reducing poverty. Today, Parliament’s plenary adopted the employment guidelines and we have asked the Council to take them into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If we really want to achieve the objectives we have committed to, if we really want Europe to lead the way in terms of competitiveness and if we really want a fair Europe to ensure its citizens’ well-being, the right of free movement of workers must be respected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The free movement of workers is one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms. A powerful internal market can only be achieved by opening up the labour market completely.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the Commission Communication in November 2008, mobility flows have had a major positive impact on economic growth in the European Union. The mobility of labour from Romania and Bulgaria has had beneficial effects on the economies of the host Member States without having any significant impact on the salaries and jobs of local nationals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The economic crisis can no longer be used as an excuse for enforcing and maintaining these labour market restrictions. Keeping these restrictions in place is a measure discouraging workers from Romania and Bulgaria from engaging in gainful employment within the relevant Member States. This factor makes workers bypass the legal regulations on the obligation to obtain a work permit, thereby increasing the incidence of illegal work. The direct upshot of illegal work is to block access to the rights deriving from the European system for the coordination of social security schemes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania and Bulgaria believe that, in the current European economic climate, removing the barriers preventing the free movement of workers throughout the EU will greatly help boost the European Union’s ability to respond to new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, I want to ask the following question because I want this European Commission to be our ally and offer full-on institutional assistance: What measures will you take to encourage Member States which are still applying restrictions to open up their labour market completely?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-404" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, free movement of workers is a fundamental principle in the EU. Together with free movement of goods, services and capital, it is a pillar of the single market and it has contributed to making European integration a success.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are well aware, for the first seven years of the EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania, Bulgarian and Romanian workers cannot fully benefit from free movement of workers. This is due to the transitional arrangements in place, as provided for by the Accession treaties, which allow the other Member States to delay the application of EU law on free movement to Bulgarian and Romanian workers for a maximum period of seven years.</p>
      <p sl="en">When Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, already 10 of the 25 Member States decided to open their labour markets to Bulgarian and Romanian workers. Today, this number has increased to 15 and only ten Member States continue to apply restrictions. It is worth noting that, among the ten Member States, several apply less strict conditions or procedures in comparison to those in place before Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to bear in mind that the decision as to whether to apply the transitional arrangements and restrict labour market access is the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned. The Commission does not have any formal role to play in ending the restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Commission is, as a matter of principle, in favour of fully applying free movement of workers. In addition, the Commission has always worked to ensure that the Member States which apply restrictions do so in line with the conditions laid down in the Accession Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also repeatedly stressed that the transitional arrangements are, by definition, temporary, and that Member States should gradually open their labour markets, instead of delaying the application of free movement of workers until the end of the seven-year period.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2006 and 2008 Commission reports on the functioning of the transitional arrangements show that labour mobility, following the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, has had a positive impact on the economy and has helped meet labour demand. These findings remain valid, even in the current economic crisis. The Commission will continue to encourage Member States to re-examine their position on labour market access, including by referring to the findings of the reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no detailed information as regards the number or social situation of irregular workers coming from the Member States that joined the EU recently. This is due precisely to the hidden character of their presence in the Member States concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the 2006 and 2008 reports, the Commission underlined that restrictions to free movement of workers do not necessarily result in protecting the national labour market and may delay labour market adjustments. What is more, transitional arrangements can exacerbate the incidence of undeclared work. It has been shown that enlargement has contributed to bringing to the surface part of the underground economy constituted by previously undeclared workers from the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also convincing evidence that nationals from the new Member States have had undeclared jobs due to the restrictions they face in accessing the labour market of the ‘old’ Member States. This is in line with the findings that mobility flows are mainly driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions and that restrictions to free movement of workers delay labour market adjustments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission does not intend to elaborate a specific study on the living and working conditions of the irregular labour force from Bulgaria and Romania or on its impact on the domestic labour markets, notably due to the lack of information and difficulties of collecting such data. However, the issue of ‘irregular workers’ from Bulgaria and Romania will be covered, as far as possible, in any analysis the Commission may develop in the future about the functioning of the transitional arrangements for Bulgaria and Romania if, as foreseen by the transitional arrangements, one of the two countries requests it. In addition, the Commission will continue to promote specific activities to combat undeclared work, in cooperation with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission understands that the fact that Bulgarian and Romanian workers still face restrictions can be perceived as discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that transitional arrangements in the area of free movement of workers were applied in the majority of previous enlargements. In addition, transitional arrangements apply, not only to Bulgarian and Romanian workers, but also to workers from eight of the ten Member States that joined the EU in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also worth pointing out that the current transitional arrangements offer more flexibility to Member States by allowing them to decide when to start applying EU law on free movement of workers during the seven-year-period in the light of the situation of their labour market (the previous transitional arrangements simply deferred the introduction of EU law on free movement of workers by a number of years).</p>
      <p sl="en">However, discrimination perceived by Bulgarian and Romanian workers who cannot work freely in the ten Member States that still apply restrictions does not constitute discrimination in the legal sense of the term. Although Article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibits discrimination based on nationality, it does so subject to specific provisions contained in the other EU treaties. The transitional arrangements laid down in the Accession Treaty constitute such provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Temporarily restricting labour market access to Bulgarian and Romanian workers on the basis of the transitional arrangements is therefore not contrary to EU law.</p>

    <intervention id="3-405" speaker_id="1922" name="Thomas Mann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, under the 2+3+2 rule, Germany and Austria are making full use of the seven-year transitional period before there is complete freedom of movement for workers from the Member States which joined in 2004. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, Germany is also using the full amount of time permitted during the second phase from 2009 to 2011.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Dalli has said that there are 10 Member States which are still subject to restrictions. There is a valid reason for this, because the Member States have had different experiences. These restrictions are never discriminatory – you have rightly referred to Article 18 in this respect – and have specific time limits. The opportunity to get used to change gradually is an important and fundamental political choice. Our experience is that making free movement available to workers too early exposes the labour market to major risks. This concerns different target groups, such as the long-term unemployed and also low-qualified workers, and in my country, for example, the regions of eastern Germany. We will have to continue regulating access to jobs in the EU, because of the differing experiences in different areas, but this will, of course, lead to changes in the near future. However, we are not yet properly prepared for these changes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Calling on the Commission to carry out a study on the so-called positive influence of illegal workers from Bulgaria and Romania is totally the wrong approach. When illegal workers are breaking the law, this cannot be played down by statistics, however positive they appear. I remain in favour of strict controls which will allow us to combat illegal working. We owe it to those people who are legally employed.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is another important task which we must work on together and that is to look in detail at full freedom of movement from 2012 onwards. This involves both opportunities and risks. Only when we differentiate between them and deal with facts and only when we have an informed, detailed discussion can we stop armchair politics from coming into the situation, prevent exclusion and ensure that we are not suddenly working against rather than with each other. This is the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
      <p sl="de">As early as December 2009, I asked the Commission whether there was any usable information available about the effects of full freedom of movement for workers. The answer was that the free movement of workers has a positive impact on the economy and no negative side-effects on the labour market. I am sorry, Mr Dalli, but that is not good enough. You were not in office at the time, but that makes it all the more important for your department to understand people’s fears and to contribute a great deal of knowledge to the discussion which we need to have on change and to giving substance to the arguments in the old and new Member States.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Commissioner, I would like us to use this debate to appeal to the governments of the Member States where Bulgarian and Romanian citizens continue to face various restrictions on the labour market to lift them as soon as possible. The reasons for this are not only linked to the principles of the European Union, one of which is the free movement of persons.</p>
      <p sl="bg">From an economic perspective, opening up the labour market ensures much added value. On the one hand, this is because of the larger supply of specialists in areas where there are insufficient candidates in the domestic market. I can give you as an example Bulgarian doctors and healthcare workers who are working in regions where Member States simply do not have their own staff available. This creates a problem in remote regions of Bulgaria, but resolves the problems in regions of the UK and France, for instance. It means lower costs and better public services for taxpayers. In the economic sector, employees from the new Member States are usually either highly qualified specialists whom any economy would like to use or workers who are making up shortfalls in the labour market, increasing competitiveness and preventing companies from relocating outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The assumption that citizens from the European Union’s new Member States displace local low-paid workers is absolutely unfounded and populist. A Bulgarian citizen who goes to work in another country needs money for accommodation, for supporting his family and sending his children to school. He also tries to save money with the prospect of returning home one day. There is also the language barrier problem on top of this. Reports about how low a salary this citizen would agree to work for are an urban myth for domestic consumption. This is also confirmed by the European Commission’s data, according to which the share of migrant workers from the new Member States has increased from 0.2% to 0.5% of the population of the old Member States following the European Union’s enlargement. There is obviously no migration wave. On the other hand, the problem is that there are far fewer migrant workers from Member States than immigrants from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The labour market restrictions cannot be justified with objective arguments. Equal access to the markets results in much greater transparency, yields economic gains and has a beneficial impact on Member States’ social systems. Commissioner, we are expecting the Commission to monitor very closely the processes and to inform Member States about the benefits of opening up the market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am somewhat satisfied that Mr Barroso announced on Tuesday that deepening the single market was at the top of his agenda. Twenty-four years after the Single European Act and eighteen years after it was due for completion, the single market is still not a fully-fledged reality. To quote Mr Barroso: ‘Only 8% of Europe’s 20 million SMEs engage in cross-border trade’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Monti report identifies 150 barriers within the European Union that impede the free movement of people, goods, capital and services. This so-called ‘single market’ seems to me more like a French gruyere!</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso is now selling us the idea of a single market act and is calling for a relaunch of Mr Delors’ European idea. Let me refresh our minds about European history: if we want to create a single market effectively based on the principle of the free movement of people, goods, capital and services; if we want to avoid economic nationalism as a backlash against economic crisis; and if we want to be the most competitive economy and to boost competitiveness and create more jobs and growth, then our first and utmost priority should be to lift these unjustifiable barriers to the free movement of workers imposed on Romania, Bulgaria and the ten new Member States, which are based on irrational fears that have not proven justified.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must be extremely stringent with Member States that choose to maintain transitory restrictions. These will have to be justified on the basis of sound economic data. The alleged vulnerability, or serious disturbances, of national labour markets will have to be proven on the basis of rational figures and will have to be scrutinised on the basis of statistics and facts.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Mr Barroso wants to relaunch the single market, then it is about time we acted according to our words. It is about time to tear down these shameful walls of economic protectionism and nationalism.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This week we have seen much discussion in Parliament on freedom of movement, particularly from Romania and Bulgaria, not only as it relates to the issue of workers, but also, yesterday, on the matter of the Roma or gypsy minority. We often lose ourselves in the legal details of this issue, and we forget that the law should only be a basic framework for the spirit of the European Union, which is one centred on freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The law is the minimum threshold for freedom of movement. At present, the governments of various Member States are using the law as a way of countering the constitutional spirit of the EU. In Parliament, we too are mired in legal analysis, forgetting that we are a political Chamber, not a legal consultancy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must be the bearers of a vision for Europe, and we must be more emphatic in stressing that freedom of movement is the goal of the EU. In the same way, I believe that the Commission falls far short of this ideal. The role of the Commission has changed recently. The Commissioner tells us that Member States have a right to impose restrictions, and that the Commission has nothing to do with it. Yet it does! The Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and I believe that it has to be much more emphatic and passionate about advocating freedom of movement. We know that large regional units such as the US or Brazil, or our competitors which, like these two countries, have internal freedom of movement, respond much better to crises, because their workforce can look for work where it is. We in Europe have had difficulty from the outset in being able to respond to this crisis quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By acting on national self interest in this area, the Member States are forgetting the public interest. When they act this way with the capital market, the Commission speaks out forcefully, so why can it not do this when it happens to the freedom of workers?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this question opens with a statement that the free movement of workers is beneficial to the economies of Member States and does not have serious negative side effects on their labour markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The US economist, Professor George Borjas, disagrees. He says, ‘there is no gain from immigration if the native wage is not reduced by immigration’. In 2003, a study published by the Dutch Government said ‘GDP will increase but this increase will largely accrue to the migrants in the form of wages. The overall net gain in income to residents is likely to be small and may even be negative’. A report from the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs in 2008 said ‘although possible in theory, we found no systematic empirical evidence to suggest that net immigration creates significant dynamic benefits for the UK resident population’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Uncontrolled and unrestricted immigration into the UK has meant that the wages of native workers have been driven down, while living costs have been driven up because of extra demand on housing. The people at the bottom end of the economic scale have experienced this directly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Massive immigration of cheap labour may benefit an expanding and developing economy in a country with vast reserves of untapped natural resources, such as America in the 19th century, but it will have the opposite effect on a developed post-industrial economy such as Britain, as has proved to be the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Governments should protect the interests of their own citizens first and then help other countries to develop their economies by adopting sensible international trade policies, such as Britain used to do before we joined the European Union. That is why the only sensible policy for Great Britain is that of the UK Independence Party, which is to leave the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the current economic crisis requires resolute action towards the effective completion of the internal market. If we are not ready to open our markets, including the labour market, to all European citizens, the losses will be higher than the gains. Recent studies undertaken by the European Commission have proved that opening our labour market will be beneficial and that worries concerning job losses due to labour migration are totally unfounded.</p>
      <p sl="en">This sort of scaremongering has been proved wrong again and again. In 2006, British experts estimated that 300 000 Romanians would flood Britain in search of jobs. They are still looking for them. Nothing of the kind happened. The truth is that there is no rational reason to maintain the labour barrier for Romanian and Bulgarian workers. Past experience shows that workers from eastern Member States fill a gap in the labour market and take jobs that are not wanted or are not fully covered by the local workforce.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, there is no way Romanians and Bulgarians will arrive in Western Europe to take advantage of its generous welfare system. Both Romania and Bulgaria have high enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education. Both countries have a highly skilled resilient workforce. If the EU wants to make full use of its resources in these times of crisis, then political trust and economic openness should be properly established between Member States. To quote President Barroso’s speech of two days ago in this House, ‘we either swim together or sink separately.’ To paraphrase this, we either work together or get unemployed separately.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission report clearly points out that labour supply and demand determine the volume and direction of the workers, rather than any restrictions on the labour market. Furthermore, it states that future immigration flows to the EU from Bulgaria and Romania are highly unlikely.</p>
      <p sl="en">These restrictions stimulate the creation of bad practices, due to the vulnerability of the illegal workers who are easily exploitable. As Commissioner De Gucht said, this flow of people would not change if it was made official, but the result would be that they would pay social contributions and taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Post-enlargement flows from Bulgaria and Romania have also been significantly outnumbered by recent immigration of non-EU nationals. Obviously, non-discrimination and freedom of movement are fundamental rights for every European Union worker, and it is an unfortunate fact that some EU Member States, as pointed out in the report, have decided not to comply with these basic principles.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about a single European Union and a single European market, we cannot support restrictions which have been artificially imposed on every citizen of the European Union exercising the guaranteed right to work in other Member States without being discriminated against on the grounds of citizenship, as this would constitute a gross violation against Bulgarian and Romanian citizens on the labour market. In the spirit of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, we must prevent a separate category from being created, as also mentioned by Mr Kirilov, as we do not want to be second-class citizens of the European Union. To achieve this, we must lift the temporary restrictions on the free movement of Bulgarian and Romanian workers.</p>
      <p sl="bg">With this in mind, I call on the Commission to propose concrete measures to allow significant progress to be made towards greater access to labour markets being granted by Member States to regular workers from Bulgaria and Romania without breaching local labour legislation provisions in the relevant European states.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The latest events in Europe relating to the migration of the Roma minority from both our countries, who are availing themselves of the opportunity of freedom of movement to find a better future, clearly highlight that it is time for the Commission to take action. Bearing in mind the proven positive impact of mobility following the EU’s enlargement and to ensure that the internal market operates more effectively, I call on the Commission to propose a package of credible measures aimed at encouraging Member States to amend their labour market policy and at getting national governments to make a commitment not to extend the current restrictions imposed on Bulgarian and Romanian citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, France is unfortunately one of the 10 Member States that have imposed restrictions on the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers. If my information is correct, it was even France that called for the measures implemented at the time of the accession of the first eight Eastern European countries to be extended to Romania and Bulgaria. It must be said that the French Government at that time was not very different from the one that is currently in power and was particularly mistrustful of citizens from those two countries. A huge amount of legislation was passed at that time to prevent the entry of citizens from those two countries because, as far as the French authorities are concerned, behind Romanians and behind Bulgarians there are Roma.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you have told us, Commissioner, freedom of movement is a fundamental principle of the EU. In this Chamber, we often talk of our common values, of our commitment to human rights. Why then, Commissioner, are men, and women, of course, treated less favourably than capital and goods?</p>
      <p sl="fr">You tell us that worker mobility has positive effects on the economy and that this holds true, even in the current economic circumstances. Why then, Commissioner, does the Commission not devote as much energy to convincing States that these restrictions must be removed as it devotes in other economic fields?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Commissioner, you say to us, ‘It is not States that discriminate against these workers.’ As a Frenchwoman, I really cannot agree with you there.</p>

    <intervention id="3-414" speaker_id="96834" name="Iliana Ivanova" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always emphasised in its work its role of expressing the interests of European citizens. I believe that most of us will agree that discrimination on any grounds whatsoever has no place in the kind of European Union which we want to see and want our children to grow up in. The restrictions on workers from Bulgaria and Romania, even if they are legally substantiated by both countries’ accession treaties, are essentially discriminatory on the basis of nationality. We cannot talk about unfair treatment to Roma while, at the same time, turning a blind eye to the different treatment shown towards workers from two full EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I support what fellow Members have said. The research carried out and recommendations made by the European Commission genuinely prove that enlargement of the labour markets has had a positive impact and is conducive to the overall development of the single European internal market. However, the fact remains that 10 Member States are continuing to retain restricted access to their labour markets until 2013.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Fellow Members, Europe is at a crossroads and we must choose now in which direction to go: towards more or less integration. In my view, there is undoubtedly only one direction: a strong, united Europe. However, this path also involves all of us showing the clear desire to respect the fundamental European values, which means the free movement of persons and workers. I sincerely hope that protectionism does not prevail when national policies are being drawn up because we will be much stronger facing the world together than divided. I want to call on the European Commission, with the support, of course, of the European Parliament as well, to really cooperate more actively and decisively with the countries which are still imposing restrictions so that they can be lifted early. I believe that this will also help the European economy recover more quickly from the recession so that we can all look our citizens in the eye with a clear conscience and tell them that there is no discrimination in the European Union in the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Bulgaria and Romania obviously countered the fears of Europeans about huge flows of workers which would have threatened their labour markets. The European Commission’s statistics showed that less than 1% of Bulgarians are looking for work in the old Member States. Even against the background of a severe financial and economic crisis and new fears of spiralling unemployment, the trend did not change. Workers would clearly migrate to where there is a demand for labour, but the figures show that unemployment is higher in some of these 10 countries than in Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Retaining the restrictions encourages the informal economy and undeclared work. I wonder if you are aware that in the Netherlands alone, the proportion of Bulgarians and Romanians who work on the black market has increased by 8%. This is tolerated by employers and the Dutch because it reduces their costs. This is not to mention the seasonal workers without employment contracts and any social rights. Restrictions will not resolve the problem of unemployment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I am sure, Commissioner, that the European Commission has mechanisms available for lobbying the 10 countries to reconsider the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers. You referred, indeed, to the treaties, as is appropriate. However, let us not forget that the treaties were signed in different circumstances. There are new circumstances now which go by the name of ‘recession’. It is high time for a new discussion on this matter in the Council as well, which you could initiate. We are expecting you not only to be our allies, but also to propose concrete actions. You are guardian of the EU treaties and you must not allow double standards to be applied to Bulgaria and Romania whatever inclinations there obviously are and which are being heard even in this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I confess I would be better off speaking in my own language, but listening to the Commissioner’s answer, I have decided to forget about my prepared notes and to speak in English. This is firstly because I think we would like the Commissioner to understand us directly, rather than via the interpreters; and secondly, because otherwise, I suppose that we will mostly be hearing Romanian and Bulgarian during this late debate in the Chamber tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you mentioned that several studies have shown that after the accession of the countries from Eastern and Central Europe, the problems were not in the countries where the workers were accepted. In fact, it was quite the opposite: they actually had a positive impact and GDP increased, so there is no fear about an influx of workers from these countries. The fact that you also mentioned countries other than Romania and Bulgaria is no comfort at all for us. In fact, it is quite the opposite: it shows that there is discrimination against even more EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to confess that I was surprised when you said that it is up to the Member States. If we cannot speak about a single market without mentioning the labour market, and if we all admit that this is a fundamental right, then how can it be up to the Member States? We know that the enforcement of fundamental rights lies within the European Union’s sphere of responsibility, so the principle of subsidiarity does not apply.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I honestly think that the Commission should do much more to convince the Member States to lift these restrictions, which discredit the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Free movement of workers is a fundamental principle and the current state of affairs only helps confirm how absurd the restriction is which has been imposed on Romanians and Bulgarians. The European economy is feeling the impact of the ageing population and labour shortage in certain areas, thereby making worker migration a necessary solution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, we have debated the Roma crisis in France this week, which could have been avoided if these European citizens could have found a job and not been kept at the margins of society, including these employment bans. Unfortunately, instead of treating the causes, some people imagine that they can resolve something by applying police measures to the effects.

Such a step would not, in my opinion, be in accordance with the spirit and aims of the Treaty on European Union and on the functioning of the EU, or with the legally-binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which clearly states in Article 45 that every EU citizen has the right to freedom of movement and freedom to reside within the territory of the Member States.</p>

At the moment, Member States retaining internal labour market restrictions should review their position. Although, according to the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaty signed by Romania and Bulgaria, restricting the right to work is not an act of discrimination, now that so much time has elapsed since accession, it is not normal and moral for such restrictions to be retained in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is time for the Commission to take action to convince the Member States which are still retaining restrictions to lift them. How can we explain to the EU’s Romanian and Bulgarian citizens that in this House we, their elected representatives, can offer equal labour rights to all legal immigrants, but cannot do anything for them?

Or has this rule now been changed? If we take a look, ladies and gentlemen, at our parliamentary passes, we still see in them – more than six years after the EU expanded to include the countries of central Europe – only the 11 languages of the ‘old’ 15.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I am glad to have been offered this opportunity to set out where the Commission stands on the sensitive issue of animal cloning for food production.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I should underline that there is no evidence of any food safety concerns regarding foods obtained from cloned animals. There are, however, some animal welfare issues that require further consideration. Such concerns are nevertheless likely to decrease over time, as the technique evolves and improves. There is, of course, an ethical dimension to this issue, which, I should add, lies outside the EU’s legislative remit. Other considerations in the general debate on this issue are consumers’ rights to know about production processes, and the likely trade implications of taking measures in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most important issue for the Commission is to assess the need, feasibility and proportionality of possible measures to regulate the use of the cloning technique and of cloned animals and products. Naturally, I am fully aware of Parliament’s position on the use of cloning technologies for food production in Europe. Honourable Members would like to see a ban extended to the offspring of cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission position is that foods from cloned animals should not be put on the market without prior authorisation, as they are considered novel foods, and indeed are currently covered by the Novel Food Regulation. It is worth adding that, given the value of cloned animals, it is highly unlikely that they would be used directly for food purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation with regard to the offspring of cloned animals is, however, rather different. Such animals cannot be distinguished from those of conventional lineage. This aspect also has to be taken into consideration in any line of action the Commission may propose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the current position, the Commission acknowledges that the Novel Food Regulation is not the appropriate legal framework for addressing all aspects of the cloning issue. In particular, the production and marketing of products other than food – such as ova, sperm or embryos – cannot be covered by the Novel Food Regulation, which deals exclusively with the pre-market authorisation of food products.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members will know, we are currently putting together a report which will cover all aspects of the use of cloning for food production. That report will be made available in November. It will serve as a useful basis for future discussions among the institutions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation about the cloning of animals for use as food.</p>
      <p sl="es">Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons.</p>
      <p sl="es">It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned.</p>
      <p sl="es">And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my thanks for the information that you have given us. Ladies and gentlemen, all forms of biotechnology raise fears among the public, which is particularly sensitive to these issues. Animal cloning is no exception to this rule. It is up to us, as the political decision makers, to promote debate that is sufficiently informed so as to allow us to make an unbiased analysis of the matter. It is important to note that here, I am talking about animal cloning for food production. From the standpoint of food security, this is covered by existing regulations, and the review of new foods has been the subject of a wide-ranging discussion in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The recent events in the UK this summer have put this issue in the public domain and brought to light an apparent discrepancy between European legislation and its application at national level. The scientific reports drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority point to the conclusion that, for cattle and pigs alone, there are pathologies associated with the development of clones that raise questions about animal welfare. These were considered serious enough for the European Ethical Group to deem animal cloning for food production to be unjustifiable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">From the standpoint of food security, the same scientific reports concluded that there was no verifiable difference between cow’s milk and beef and pork from healthy clones and their offspring in comparison with the same products from normal animals. However, these reports pointed out that there are only limited data available, and that it has not been possible to carry out extensive studies during the whole lifespan of the clones and their offspring. This leads to some uncertainty as to the conclusions that have already been obtained, and means that there is a need to continue this discussion, based on science, so as to provide answers to the public’s questions without irresponsibly vetoing the possibilities of science.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore welcome the presence of the Commissioner and look forward to the report which he will submit to us on the regulation that needs to be applied to cloning technology, as well as the products that have already been obtained.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think it is important – as others have said and indeed the Commissioner also said in his contribution – that there is no risk at all to human health from produce from the offspring of cloned animals. I stress there the word ‘offspring’ of cloned animals, rather than the particular issue of cloned animals themselves, because these are two separate issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wanted to raise here today – as I did with you yesterday, Commissioner, when we met informally – the position that the Innes family in Scotland found themselves in earlier on this summer. They are a long-standing farming family in Scotland who are very dynamic, go-ahead farmers and have always sought to use the best genetics from around the world. They bought a bull bred in the United States, which turned out to have a clone in its parentage. They asked all the right questions at the time about the use of the animal and whether it could be used on the farm. They did not understand that there was any issue with it because it was an offspring of a cloned animal, rather than a cloned animal itself. They now have 90 females bred from that particular bull on farm, and these are worth somewhere in the region of £200 000.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was only when they started to consider selling the milk from these animals as they became old enough to produce that they discovered there was a problem. The United Kingdom’s interpretation of the current regulations is that not only the produce from the cloned animal, but the produce from the offspring, is not allowed into the UK food chain. That is an interpretation that was put in place by the Food Standards Agency. That has meant that these animals are worthless, except of course if you move them to another Member State where there is a different interpretation regarding these animals and where milk from these animals would be allowed to enter the food chain, or indeed if you sold them back to the USA.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the problem that we have in terms of lack of consistency across Member States. I think it is in the interests of both consumers and farmers that we get some certainty about this. In terms of Parliament's position, I think that we have gone too far in saying that the meat and milk and products from the offspring of cloned animals should be banned from the system. I think that is wrong and we need to see movement on that. It seems to me that we have to accept that all the scientific evidence suggests there is no difference between these animals which are offspring and any other animals, and they should be allowed into the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that at some stage over the coming months, we can see some compromise and introduce certainty that reassures both consumers and farmers on what is a very sensitive and emotional issue.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you might have given us a very exhaustive and interesting explanation, but I am astonished that you have actually said nothing about an incident this summer which, to some extent, provides the background to this debate. I am talking about an incident that took place in Scotland: a number of bull and cow embryos imported from the United States, reports that meat from at least one of the bulls has definitely entered the food chain and that some of that meat has reached my constituency in Belgium. You have said nothing about that and I would really like to hear some comment from you on this, because this is an important incident, after all. You have said yourself that part of the issue is that consumers have the right to know where their food comes from. Well, some residents in my constituency have not been given that information. They have eaten meat from bulls born in Scotland from imported embryos. I would therefore like to hear what you have to say about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You know that this whole debate is also connected with the conciliation procedure regarding the regulation on novel foods, which we started the day before yesterday, with Kartika Liotard as rapporteur. You know that we are at loggerheads with the Council over this issue. I dare say you are also well aware of the fact that throughout the conciliation procedure – which is to be completed at some point in November, perhaps at the beginning of December but, in any case, sometime during this part of the year – the position taken by the Commission will decide the outcome. You announced in a previous debate in July that you would produce a report and here I will quote you in English as saying: ‘by November 2010’. Now, however, you say ‘at some point in November’, which means at the very end of the conciliation procedure. I should hope, Commissioner, that you and your staff will be a little more dynamic in taking a stance on this issue, because we, as negotiators, will need your position in order to reach an agreement with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, you have you said nothing or, at least, not very much, about the position of Parliament which is in favour of a moratorium. There are commissioners, colleagues of yours, who are, as we speak, lobbying our colleagues not to go along with the moratorium, as that would bring about an enormous trade war, perhaps on a vaster scale than the banana war which we have engaged in with other countries in the field of trade. Could you please comment on that?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, to my fellow Members who say that this poses no threat at all to public health, I say ‘Yes, I would like to think that is the case, but let me adhere a little while longer to EFSA’s recommendation that, although there might be no reason to doubt this is the case, the scientific evidence for this is still rather too thin on the ground. I grant you, this recommendation dates from 2008. We should have new recommendations coming soon, but I would prefer to see them before I dare pass any definite judgment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s exchange of opinions shows that the debate on the legal regulation of animal cloning is going to be difficult. I think that with these new technologies for food production, we are, as it were, jumping into a swimming pool without first checking if there is any water in it. This concerns genetic modifications, the cultivation of genetically modified plants and cloning. Science has not said its last word on this subject. Science is opening up huge opportunities, but we do not have a full picture of the far-reaching effects of using the new technologies – what effect this will have on biodiversity, the equilibrium between species and the health of people and animals. There are signals which say that cloning is not good for the health of the animals involved, that they are not healthy animals, and that this often involves suffering on their part.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, let us be careful in these matters. We still do not know enough to take such a huge risk. I am therefore in favour of maintaining the ban on cloning animals for meat production in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as early as May, I made a public statement to the effect that I feared meat from cloned animals could end up on the European market. At the time, the Commission actually made light of this. For two and a half years, and again on 7 July, this Parliament – which is here to represent European citizens – has, by an overwhelming majority, supported my demand for a ban on cloned meat. Therefore, it is not the case, as the Commissioner has suggested, that it will be easy for citizens to recognise cloned meat if it lands on their plates. The fact remains, however, that cloned meat has now entered the food chain. I did not hear the Commissioner say anything about how he intends to prevent that happening again in the future. The only thing he has said is that we will, once again, have to wait, this time until sometime in November. I am totally fed up with all this waiting.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also have a question for you, Commissioner Dalli: surely, you will not take lying down Commissioner De Gucht’s putting it about behind the scenes that the ban on cloned animals in the food chain demanded by Parliament would lead to a trade war with the United States, Brazil and Argentina. I would rather have a trade war than a war that involves unnecessary bloodshed. Cloning is unethical and extremely cruel to animals. Cloning results in stillbirths on a large scale or in animals having to be destroyed because of deformities. While the Commission is waiting, ambiguities in legislation will lead to this practice invading the European Union, too. The Commission should come up with legislation immediately and this very day impose the moratorium on products from cloned animals and their offspring demanded by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would call on Commissioner De Gucht to stop playing lapdog to the United States and its biotechnology industry. For heaven’s sake, Commissioner, you have been appointed to represent the general interest of the European Union and its citizens and, as a member of the Commission, you are not required to accept the instructions of any government, institution, body or authority, and all I am doing here is citing the Treaty on the European Union. Have things really deteriorated to the point where Europe is allowing our policy to be swayed, to the detriment of our citizens, out of fear of repercussions from the World Trade Organisation? If they are, then right now, I am ashamed of the state of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you will be pleased to hear that I am only going to speak for a minute. We face a very similar situation here to the controversy over GM crops. In each case, the objective scientific safety tests have been successfully passed, but in each case, there has been a subjective and emotional backlash that no qualitative test can legislate for.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of GM crops, the Commission has now allowed decisions to be taken by Member States’ elected governments, which, of course, is where all decisions should be taken. This development has only occurred after years and years of stalemate and buck-passing between different EU institutions. It is unsurprising that present EU law is confused over the commercial use of the offspring of cloned animals, and it is certainly not the job of this Chamber to increase this confusion with yet more EU regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The correct procedure here is to allow Member States, with their very different cultures, to decide for themselves whether or not to allow commercial production of these products. Those countries which choose not to must have complete freedom over the method of labelling imports, without EU interference.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner’s statement on this issue tonight. As George Lyon indicated, several issues have emerged in the United Kingdom recently surrounding the marketing of cloned offspring. The lack of a consistent message between the Commission guidance and that of the UK Food Standards Agency has caused a great deal of confusion. This, I must say, is through no fault of the Commission’s, but it has brought hardship to producers and has certainly had an impact on confidence in the safety of food.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unsustainable and illogical that the UK Food Standards Agency regards products from the offspring of cloned animals as novel foods in the United Kingdom, while in other countries across Europe, this is not the case. I am pleased to learn that discussions have taken place on the matter between the Commission and the Food Standards Agency to try to bring clarity for both producers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The nature of a novel food in the context of cloned animals and offspring of a cloned animal must be made clear. With a unified approach on this issue across Europe – and indeed beyond in terms of third country imports – the contradictory advice in the UK which has been offered thus far must cease. As we all know, confidence in both the source and the safety of food is essential. I welcome the Commission’s attempt to keep that confidence in food safety in place.</p>

    <intervention id="3-442" speaker_id="1930" name="Horst Schnellhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, during the discussion about your Novel Food Regulation before the summer recess, we decided not to include the issue of cloned meat in this regulation, but instead to call on the Commission to adopt an additional regulation. Therefore, I welcome the fact that Mr Dalli is making proposals today concerning the direction in which this regulation should go. I see today’s discussion as the basis for the regulation which we expect the Commission to submit to us in November. For this reason, it is very important that we are having this discussion here today.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are well aware that time is pressing and this has already been mentioned today on several occasions. For example, in the USA, at least 150 cloned cattle are being kept for breeding purposes. Then there were the events that took place in the United Kingdom during the summer recess. No one has yet clarified whether this was just a silly season story or whether there really is some truth in it. However, I would like to remind everyone of the reason why we called for the special regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the one hand, we said that it is not entirely clear whether cloned meat really is completely harmless. This is supported by the fact that only comparisons of the different materials have so far been carried out, in other words, comparisons of meat from non-cloned animals and meat from cloned animals. Therefore, we do not yet have proper proof, as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also said. We need to hold more tests and await the results.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also mentioned a second aspect of the issue, which involves the ethical dimension and animal welfare. It is not correct to say that we have no rights in this area. The Treaty of Lisbon covers the question of animal welfare and we can cite the treaty in the case of transgressions or if animals are constantly put at risk. Of course, we need to clarify this and to obtain the corresponding proof if we are to speak out in favour of a ban. I believe that this is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you go into a supermarket and look at the labelling on the joints of beef, you will not be able to prove that what is stated on the labels is correct. This means that it is possible to add information indicating that the meat is cloned to the labelling. We have a register for animals which allows us to track where an animal comes from without it being labelled. We can trace every detail right back to the animal’s ancestors. Therefore, we have the means readily available to prove whether meat comes from a cloned animal or from one that has not been cloned. As the saying goes, a person can disappear, but an animal cannot, because all its details are recorded.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have the means and we should use them if we decide to allow cloned meat to be sold. It is possible to prove whether or not meat is cloned, but we need complete traceability and strict labelling in the interests of consumers. In addition, you must not forget the question of animal welfare. We believe that to be very, very important.</p>

    <intervention id="3-443" speaker_id="2327" name="Linda McAvan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wonder if Commissioner Dalli could clarify exactly what he intends to bring before us in November. He talks about a report, but what we have heard about here is a real legal loophole where farmers have been put in an impossible position because there is no clarity about what the actual legislation in place now means. We want more than a discussion and a report in November. Even if the Commission brings forward new proposals, it could take 18 months before we have any new law.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the interim, before there is any new law and any new clarity, I would strongly recommend that we have a moratorium on food products from cloned animals. I want to echo what Mr Schnellhardt has just said in relation to the Commissioner’s claim that we cannot take on board ethical issues in legislation. That is not correct. The Lisbon Treaty has a provision which states that all EU policies must take animal welfare into account. I wonder whether the Commissioner has read the report by the European Group on Ethics. For colleagues who do not know what this is, it is the group set up by President Barroso to look at the ethical aspects of EU policy. That report states clearly that there are major concerns about animal suffering in connection with cloning and food. It states that there should be further studies on the long-term animal welfare of clones and their offspring.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another concern the Commissioner has not mentioned is biodiversity. If there are herds of animals which are all from the same cloning family, the report states that this could create huge problems of interbreeding and increased vulnerability of the food supply chain. It also states that there is a problem of cloned meat leading to an increase in meat consumption, with serious environmental consequences. The conclusion of that ethical committee – which is the Commission’s own ethical committee – is that we need more public debate before we allow food from cloned animals onto the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, we need that debate. We need you to stop now, not to put farmers in this impossible position, and to make the law clear. We cannot wait two or three years to do that. You need to act, quickly, with a moratorium now, and then have a proper debate on a proper piece of legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I was very surprised by what you said, Mr Dalli. You behaved as if nothing had happened. In July, Parliament took up a very clear position and called on you to impose a moratorium. Since then, nothing has been done. We called for draft legislation to be drawn up and nothing has happened there either. A question which I submitted in May in which we asked how many cloned animals and how many offspring of cloned animals were in the system has made it very clear that you are completely clueless. In your answer, you said that we do not know, we cannot say anything about this and we have no idea. In other words, you do not know what is happening, but you are behaving as if it were possible for us to wait until November when you produce your report. That is not good enough. We have called on you to act and so far you have done nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">What Mr Leinen said is not correct. Parliament has spoken out very clearly in favour of a moratorium on the second generation. We cannot now simply deny that. We must make it very clear that this is also a problem, because all the studies show that this technology has simply not been tested sufficiently. No long-term investigations are taking place. It is becoming obvious in the light of what has happened so far that significant breaches of animal welfare legislation, including that of the European Union, are being committed when animals are cloned. The fact that only 15% of the animals survive and are capable of survival is a clear violation of the EU animal welfare directive. Within the EU, we have the precautionary principle and we must take it seriously. As long as there are risks to health and the technology is not fully developed, we must not experiment with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The public is clearly opposed to cloning for food production. The people of Europe are not waiting for cloned meat to be produced and neither are the farmers. On the contrary, the public takes a very critical view of all of this and ultimately we must not put the critical awareness of consumers at risk. The public expects much more of us. We are expected to handle this topic with great care and not simply to say that it is a new, innovative technology and we will go ahead and use it. We must take a highly critical approach to new technologies, but I suspect that the Commission is not prepared to do this. As is the case in other areas, the Commission has an unshakeable belief in progress. However, we should be asking: Are we on the right track? Are we acting in the interests of consumers and farmers? I believe that we are not. Therefore, you should look seriously at imposing a moratorium and putting some draft legislation on the table, because this is what we are waiting for. The incident in Scotland highlighted the Commission’s inability to act and demonstrated how little it will actually do in cases of this kind. No action was taken at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">To go back to the trade issues, we in the European Union have spoken out very clearly against the use of hormones. We have stuck to our position and we can do the same in the case of other matters. This does not involve exposing ourselves to the risk of being forced to accept trade restrictions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Parliament debated the cloning of animals for securing a source of food as long ago as September 2008. A resolution was passed in the vote, in which Members requested a complete ban on the cloning of animals designated for food processing in the European Union, as well as a ban on the import of cloned animals and cloned animal products.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The adopted text of the resolution took on board the concerns of many European specialists, particularly as far as the health risks connected with the use of cloned animals in the food industry are concerned. Cloning creates serious problems in connection with a high incidence of poor health and the mortality of the cloned animals at an early age in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The scientific and technical findings of the World Organisation for Animal Health suggest that only 6% of cloned embryos result in healthy, long-living clones. This is mainly due to the fact that a clone has, from the outset, the genetic age of the original. Therefore, if the original is a seven-year old cow, the clone will be a calf whose genes are seven years old from the start. Cloning also damages the genome of the individual, which then makes the clone more susceptible to diseases and parasites.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The problems of cloning relate not only to the health and decent living conditions of animals, of course, but also to consumer confidence in the food that might come from such sources. Although the US Food and Drug Administration states that meat and milk products from cloned animals, pigs, sheep, cattle and their descendents are, in its opinion, just as reliable as products produced from animals reared in the current way, I would not consider it wise, Commissioner, for commercial reasons alone, to open the door to such products and to expose the European public to an unjustifiable risk of the consequences of products from cloned animals and their descendants entering the food chain.</p>

    <intervention id="3-446" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, it has undoubtedly been proved that bringing meat from cloned animals onto the market involves increased risks to human health, in particular, because cloned animals and their offspring are more susceptible to a wide range of diseases. Therefore, the current ban on products from cloned animals must be extended to cover their offspring. We can also put forward ethical reasons for doing this and bring animal welfare arguments into play.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to this, it is important for us to ensure as soon as possible that consumers are given comprehensive information about the origins of the meat they are buying. Consumers must have the opportunity to choose not to buy specific products. Above all, we must make sure that people are not palmed off with products of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we have just heard, products from the offspring of cloned animals have found their way into the food chain in the United Kingdom. However, it is possible that the case in the United Kingdom is not a one-off. Unfortunately, it is likely that the citizens of European countries are eating cloned meat without being aware of it. This is not acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, I am very much in favour of green genetic engineering, but cloning is something else altogether. The two things cannot be compared. Cloning involves cruelty to animals, as many of my fellow Members have already said. In the discussion which we had before the summer recess, I explained that only a fraction of animal clones are capable of surviving. Many of those which do initially survive go on to die at a very early age in great agony. They have deformed extremities and organs. They have weakened immune systems and are susceptible to disease. This leads to pain, suffering and an agonising death. Can we accept responsibility for this? If we really are in favour of animal welfare, should we be supporting methods of this kind? No, we should not. That is why we decided in July that we did not want cloned meat or the products of cloned animals. This is a consistent approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true that we know that the products of cloned animals and their offspring probably cause no damage to human health, and personally, I believe that they are suitable for human consumption, but there is no shortage of meat produced by conventional methods. So why should we make use of clones? It is completely unnecessary to treat animals cruelly. The people of Europe do not want this and they do not want these products. We do not need them. There is no argument for introducing cloned meat into the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why we want a clear regulation which applies specifically to cloned animals and their offspring. I want to see a ban on cloning and cloned products in the European Union and I believe that we can push this through. Of course, it must also apply to imports. I want to be sure that I am not being fobbed off with cloned meat on the quiet, because it is not labelled, as has just happened in Scotland. I do not believe that all meat can be traced back to its origins. This may be possible in the case of beef. However, it is not possible to tell whether there is a cloned animal in the ancestry of a specific pig, because of the amount of pork produced.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a fundamental, ethical question. Other Members have said that we need to deal with ethical issues, because we are responsible for them. This is, of course, a question of animal welfare, but it also concerns another issue. Experience shows, and I am a livestock farmer, I have studied this subject, that all the reproduction methods which have been proven to function in livestock rearing eventually find their way into human medicine. Therefore, we must ask ourselves today whether we want and are able to accept human cloning in the possibly not too distant future. I do not want to and I am not able to. Even if a clone was created of me to supply spare parts and, in future, was able to donate a vital organ for my use, I would still not want this to happen. I do not believe that this is an exaggerated horror story. I believe that this would be possible in the not too distant future if we were to permit cloning to take place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we urgently need a ban not only on cloning, but also on cloned animals and their offspring throughout the EU. I am not afraid of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We can push this through. We do not have to imitate everything that the USA does, despite our transatlantic relationship.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Commissioner, I have come to know you in the past year, since you became Commissioner, as someone who protects the health of European consumers and European citizens. Both Linda McAvan and Mrs Sommer, who spoke before me, as well as my fellow Member, Capoulas Santos, talked about this. The arguments have been presented. We have heard the healthcare arguments, that even though there has been research conducted in the USA, we would like objective European research, not influenced by any American interest groups, which actually demonstrates that these products are not detrimental to health. However, even if it is so and they are not detrimental to health, scientific research can be continued. However, I too have heard it said that there are no reasons to continue research. As a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I believe that nothing within the European agri-business justifies having cloned food products on our store shelves.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It has also been stated, and I fully agree, that there are loopholes in this system. I recall a recent instance when I contacted you regarding Moroccan fruit and vegetables. This shows that we do need to protect our markets against imports as well. Both Linda McAvan and others have raised animal welfare considerations, and I fully agree with those who spoke before me that science cannot be halted. However, we must draw a line at a certain point and restrain cloning, because neither I nor my assistants would like to come across my clone. This is ethically untenable and we call on the Commission to declare a moratorium.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the discussion we have had this evening clearly demonstrates how sensitive this issue is. We debated it recently, are still debating it this evening, and will debate it once again when you present your communication on this issue, Commissioner. However, I believe that a very rigorous approach should be adopted when dealing with such a sensitive issue as products from cloned animals in the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have heard a great deal said about the risks to health. I should just like to point out that our present position is based on that of the European Food Safety Authority, which says that there is currently nothing to indicate that products derived from cloned animals or their offspring pose any new or additional health or environmental risks when compared with conventionally bred animals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore err on the side of caution. Let us not automatically come down on one side or the other before we are genuinely in possession of all the scientific facts. We must be careful not to adopt a defensive position or, worse, an entrenched position on an issue which is so complex – as our discussions have so clearly shown – and which deserves thorough examination, in particular, with regard to international trade rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In reality, Commissioner, you were right when you said that the risk in Europe is limited. We have a conventional livestock farming industry that is certainly sufficient. What happens, though, when farmers import semen that may come from the US and be obtained from cloned animals? Here, too, we need every possible safeguard so as to ensure that the World Trade Organisation rules are being complied with and that there are no opportunities to create conditions of unfair competition. Our farmers are waiting for such responses, and ultimately, they are the ones who are in difficulty today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with my fellow Members when they tell us that consumers definitely do not wish to consume meat obtained from these animals. However, I have no doubt at all about Commissioner Dalli’s desire to shed light on this issue and to respond to the many questions that remain unanswered today. I already have every confidence in what Commissioner Dalli may say to us, and I await his report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">EU consumers must know what they are eating, and traceability is crucial. If we are to ensure this, however, we need a rigorous scientific analysis that will enable us to take informed action, so that we can find a suitable solution to the issue of importing food from cloned animals and their offspring into the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why I will wait for Commissioner Dalli’s communication, scheduled for November, before making my decision.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I was recently alarmed by the news that products derived from cloned animals from North America have got into the European food chain.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament has expressed on more than one occasion its view that these foods should be banned for a number of reasons based on ethical and environmental considerations. We will continue to adopt a strong, united stance on this matter at a time when negotiations are being conducted on the subject of novel food regulations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The evidence provided by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Group on Ethics indicates that there are serious health problems which affect both cloned animals and their surrogate mothers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, in terms of protecting the environment, the impact of the rise in meat consumption could have a devastating effect, and a large number of cloned animals would affect the natural biodiversity, thereby increasing the animals’ vulnerability to epidemics and threatening food safety.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have already heard the arguments relating to trade and World Trade Organisation regulations. We are told that we cannot ban the introduction of these foods in the European Union without breaching the obligations stipulated by the WTO. However, the European Union has decided to stop the introduction of certain products on the market when there have been doubts about the benefits for consumers or concerns that consumers are being misled. We will consider every legal option for implementing such a ban.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, looking at the situation as a whole, we should insist that the WTO regulations also take into account similar ethical and environmental protection considerations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are serious arguments against foods derived from cloned animals. On the other hand, there is no clear proof of the benefits they provide. It is time for the Commission to propose a concrete solution in relation to this issue which will also take into account the view of our forum which represents Europe’s citizens. We cannot allow experiments which will endanger citizens’ health or the environment.</p>

    <intervention id="3-451" speaker_id="96914" name="Anne Delvaux" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my serious reservations about this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, we – the EU – are advocating greater food transparency for consumers, seeking to establish a system for tracing meat from farm to fork, and thus imposing very strict livestock farming and slaughtering standards on livestock breeders and certain controls for guaranteeing, as far as possible, the origin and quality of food. On the other hand, however, we learned this summer that British consumers had unknowingly eaten cloned beef. In my country, Belgium, there is even a possibility that third-generation meat, which we are told is not cloned meat at all, has been consumed. Is this ultimately what we mean when we talk about ‘traceability’?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to add a touch of humour: as far as I am concerned, I do not want to have cloned beef bourguignon and genetically modified carrots on my plate! And especially if I have not chosen to eat them. This seems to be the prevailing opinion across the EU, since all the Eurobarometer surveys carried out on the issue of cloning animals for food confirm time and again the very clear opposition of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the first argument which I wish to cite against the presence of cloned animal products in the food chain: we cannot, on the one hand, call for consumers to be given greater responsibility and want them to be better informed about what they eat and, on the other, ignore their desire not to eat cloned meat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second argument relates to health. It is true that no scientific study has provided proof of any potentially negative impact from consuming cloned meat, meat from the offspring of a cloned animal, or even milk from a cloned animal. Nothing has been proven, and that includes the long-term safety of this type of consumption. I therefore think that the precautionary principle should still be applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third and final argument is an ethical one, and you yourself raised it at the beginning of your speech. The EU wishes to be in the vanguard of animal protection. This afternoon, Parliament once again voted for a restriction on animal experimentation in order to minimise the pain and suffering inflicted on animals. However, there is no denying the fact that cloning causes animal suffering. One need only think back to Dolly and the EFSA Scientific Opinion of July 2008, which states that the health and welfare of a significant proportion of cloned animals has been found to be adversely affected, often severely, and with fatal consequences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs McAvan also referred to the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, which doubted whether cloning animals for food is ethically justified, particularly as it cannot be justified by a need for food diversification. Quite the contrary: there is reason to fear that the promotion of food from cloned animals will have an indirect effect on genetic diversity due to the excessive use of a restricted number of animals in breeding programmes. This is what has happened in other food sectors; dozens of tomato species have disappeared, for example. In 1900, there were 7 000 species; today, there are only 150 left, 70 of which are commercially available, and a large number of those are genetically modified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is this the sort of progress we want? That is the question we must ask ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I really cannot remember there being such unanimity in this Chamber during any other debate. Why is that? For the very simple reason that there is absolute unanimity among the citizens of the European Union, absolute unanimity against cloned products. You and my honourable friends spoke about the danger of the World Trade Organisation. It is an argument which we have heard time and again in this Chamber, a political argument.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, what the Commission and its legal advisors need to do is not to highlight these fears but to examine how we can achieve the moratorium sought by plenary without encountering such problems. We really must decide which is more important: the World Trade Organisation or the Treaty of Lisbon, which introduces the principle of caution where provision is made to ban the movement of a product on the European market if the scientific data on it are not clear enough to guarantee its safe trade and we do not know exactly what applies to cloned products.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore need this moratorium because, as all of us in this Chamber agree, Commissioner, we cannot experiment with the health of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, personally I am not at all convinced of the necessity, the morality, the safety or the traceability of cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards necessity, we have, for years, been trying to encourage extensive rather than intensive production, and there are enough ways to ensure natural reproduction, and other ways of guaranteeing a growth in the animal population, if so required. As regards morality, as Mrs Sommer said, if it is morally acceptable to have cloned animals, then it is only going to be a matter of time until it is morally acceptable to have cloned human beings. We have enough oddballs in the world already without cloning more!</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Staes mentioned safety, and I agree with him. How can one conclusively say at this stage that the offspring of cloned animals are safe for human consumption? I do not think one can. Finally, on traceability, one of our great achievements in the European Union, as Anne Delvaux said, is that we can trace food from the stable to the table. What are we going to do now: guarantee that we can trace it from clone to home? I do not think we should be doing this. Our aim should be to eliminate cloning, not to facilitate it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, the first case of cloned meat reaching the supermarkets happened in the United Kingdom. This received intensive media coverage and has led to uncertainty among consumers, on the one hand, and to unjustified accusations, on the other. Because the British Food Standards Agency was unable to come up with an explanation, the issue was immediately blamed on the reporting habits of the farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Dalli, the results of delays in the EU legislative procedure must not be blamed on farmers. Until now, only products of cloned animals and not those of their offspring have required a licence in Europe. The European Parliament expressed its opinion clearly in the Novel Food Regulation. The precautionary principle must particularly apply in the case of food.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regardless of the ethical considerations, we do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of food supply security. There are apparently serious interinstitutional differences of opinion on the handling of cloned foods. Therefore, we must call on the Commission urgently to reach an agreement for the sake of consumers and producers and to take the appropriate measures.</p>

My job is not to do what is technically feasible, but to represent the interests of my constituents. The overwhelming majority of them, and this applies to the entire EU, do not want cloned meat on their plates.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not just a question of the fact that no damage will be caused to human health. Eggs from battery hens do not represent a risk to human health, but despite this, the EU has acted quickly and effectively in this case. I expect the same type of action in the case of meat and meat products from cloned animals, including those from the second generation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Animal welfare and ethical concerns both speak out clearly against cloned meat. We will see what the scientists in the health field have to say in future.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, maintaining the highest possible standards of food production in the Union means that we can ensure a high quality of products and meet the expectations of consumers. The results of scientific research which are available today show that in terms of quality, the meat of cloned animals does not differ in any way from the meat of animals from conventional production. In spite of this, the question of cloning itself and the use of such technologies in food production are very serious problems. With modern techniques of food production at our disposal, do we have to resort to cloning? Therefore, it is in the interests of farmers, food producers and consumers for these matters to be regulated, not just so that they do not pose a threat to food security, consumer health or the competitiveness of European agriculture. The ethical and moral dilemmas which arise when the citizens of a united Europe are faced with meals made with the meat of cloned animals should also be taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have noted down four reasons for opposing cloned meat, but we cannot resolve all of them in scientific terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first reason is that the people of the European Union do not want to eat meat from cloned animals. This also applies to products from the offspring of cloned animals. Secondly, no conclusion has yet been reached about whether eating cloned meat represents a risk to human health. Thirdly, cloning animals has been demonstrated to cause harm to the health of the animals themselves. Fourthly, cloning animals to produce food should be opposed for ethical reasons.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we must strongly oppose the practice of cloning animals for food production and the use of cloned meat. We must now put in place regulations to control cloned meat as quickly as possible. This is what the people of Europe expect of us. At the very least, cloned meat must be clearly labelled.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the unauthorised, unidentified and unnoticed entry of products from cloned animals into the food chain cannot fail to constitute cause for concern. It is particularly worrying given that this fact reached our attention only a few weeks after Parliament had once again voted in favour of prohibiting these products from being placed on the EU market. At this time, this seems to us to be a correct and fitting precautionary measure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU’s actions in this area should be guided, in the first instance, by the desire to safeguard the public interest, to maintain a high level of protection for human health and ensure food and environmental security by promoting animal welfare. These values should take precedence over any others. If the marketing of these products is authorised in the future, it will also need to respect the principles of transparency, information and consumer choice. Unfortunately, this is not the case today, for instance, with food which is partially composed of genetically modified organisms or animals that have been fed by these organisms.</p>

A majority, a large majority, of Members rejected the suffering of animals that would be used for these purposes. It is at the same time clear that cloning causes serious suffering to animals. More than 95% of cloning experiments fail. Serious diseases and physiological disabilities occur, and these animals die early. Most consumers are against such meat being in the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As my colleague, Mrs Sommer, said, this is one more serious problem. The development of animal reproduction by cloning opens the door to human reproduction by cloning.

There is also another argument which is at least just as important: European citizens do not want cloned products on their plates. They are opposed to the idea of giving their children food which has originated in a genetic experiment laboratory. A Eurobarometer survey carried out on this subject in 2008 shows that most Europeans are opposed to animal cloning, especially for the purposes of producing food. In the view of 84% of respondents, we do not have sufficient experience regarding the long-term impact for health and food safety to use cloned animals in food production. Seventy-five percent believe that cloning food for consumption is unacceptable on ethical grounds. These are significant percentages which convey a very clear message. People do not want to eat products obtained from cloning, they do not have confidence in it and do not agree with these methods. We must supplement and improve EU legislation so that there is never again the possibility of exerting pressure on, or getting round, principles or decisions in which we believe.</p>

One of these is the marketing of cloned animals, their offspring and products obtained from cloned animals. So far, this issue has caused considerable problems, related to several different aspects. These include animal welfare requirements, anchored in the Treaty of Lisbon, the right of consumers to be informed of the origin of products consumed and ethical issues. So far, we have more questions than answers in each of these areas. Hence, before the discussions by the European Union institutions about cloned animals gather momentum, we must carefully view the marketing of these animals, their offspring and products.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the two largest groups in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, have jointly taken the initiative to organise this debate with you, the European Commission, on the future of the potato starch sector in Europe. The financial crisis has placed the future of this sector in such jeopardy that it could be completely wiped off the face of our continent. Yet, this sector could ultimately play an important role in the implementation of our own EU 2020 objectives. As you are aware Commissioner, payments to this sector as part of the health check are partly coupled and partly uncoupled. This situation will come to an end in 2012 with full decoupling. Let me be clear: this is a process which I support, but in the current situation, it calls for an appropriate approach. If it is going to survive and compete with other starch sectors, the potato starch sector will need to tap new markets after full decoupling and there is vast potential for that, especially in the bio-based economy, which is certainly one of the spearheads of the European Union’s 2020 strategy. Take, for example, plastics based on potato starch instead of oil, or chemical elements for industry. However, the financial crisis has jeopardised preparations for this transition and the tapping of new markets because, unfortunately, potential investors and innovators have had no choice but to stay away. In 2012, therefore, we will face the threat of this sector crash-landing and, should that happen, surveys suggest that 40% of the European Union market could be wiped out. We are talking about 6 000 direct jobs, at least as many indirect jobs, and some 15 000 farmers who will be directly affected because they supply to this sector. We are going to witness this, not only in my region, the Northern Netherlands, but also in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Poland and France. This is why, Commissioner, we are sounding the alarm bells tonight and asking the Commission to ensure that this sector has a soft, rather than a crash, landing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My questions to you are: is the European Commission prepared to take temporary measures, for example, for a period of two years and without these affecting the budget, by making use of unused potato starch funds or agricultural funds? Is the European Commission, for example, prepared to set up a voluntary restructuring fund that will support producers who wish to curtail production of their own volition?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, I will conclude with what is, of course, the main issue behind this whole debate: does the European Commission share our view that the potato starch sector could play an important role in a bio-based economy and that it would therefore be worth our while temporarily helping this sector to make this transition?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the potato starch industry risks facing too hard a blow in the new period starting in 2012, after decades of a dependence on subsidies which has been unhealthy per se. Thousands of jobs are already at stake in the Northern Netherlands alone, an economically vulnerable area without many other large employers. However, all these people, in Groningen and elsewhere, want to continue living and working in their own region. A balanced distribution of jobs is important in all European regions, and that includes prosperous Northern Europe. We therefore need transitional rules. It is the responsibility of the EU to ensure that these are in place. That does not have to mean any extra costs. We have some spare funds from previous years in this sector, because the harvests in those years were disappointing. In addition, it is possible to make adjustments to the agricultural budget. Of course, subsidies for potato starch must end in 2012. Nobody is questioning that and the sector itself has resigned itself to this fact. Having said that, this industry does need to have a future because it is an industry in the heart of our rural communities which offers new alternatives to oil producers and will therefore soon become indispensable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for your questions on the future of the potato starch sector. The Commission welcomes the opportunity to give its view on this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reform of the potato starch sector was part of the ‘health check’, and it was at the request of the sector that the Council decided that the decoupling of all aids should coincide with the end of the quota system. In fact, the Commission had proposed a more gradual approach, phasing in the decoupling in two steps. The sector’s main argument had been that the additional delay before the aids were decoupled would allow potato starch producers to prepare for a market without quotas and without transformation aids.</p>
      <p sl="en">The request for a restructuring fund like the one in the sugar industry is difficult to accommodate within the budget allocated to the potato starch sector. Even if all current beneficiaries, including the growers of starch potatoes, agreed to renounce their coupled aids to set up a restructuring fund to finance the dismantling of potato starch factories, the available budget would be unlikely to provide a strong enough incentive.</p>
      <p sl="en">To set up a restructuring fund within the current legal framework requires a regulation, which would enter into force on 1 July 2011 at the very earliest, leaving a restructuring period of only one year with a very limited budget that would be insufficient to address an overcapacity which, according to sector representatives, could amount to up to 40% of the total production capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I mentioned earlier, going back on the decisions taken as part of the health check is not an option. We are currently discussing the future of the CAP after 2013. For the agricultural sector as a whole, we want to have a CAP that is strong, efficient and well-balanced. The potato starch sector, just like all other sectors, can participate in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy has changed the EU rules on the single payment scheme and has further decoupled the financial support which was previously linked to production.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two premiums in the potato starch sector which are currently still linked to production. These are the production aid for growers of starch potatoes, in other words, payments to farmers, and the premium for potato starch, in other words, the payments to companies and factories. Following this change in EU law, both premiums will be decoupled from production and included under the rules governing the single payment scheme. This will happen by 2012 at the latest. The production aid for growers could be decoupled from 2010 onwards, depending on the decisions made by the Member States. This means that the potato starch sector is currently supported by a production-related, comprehensive EU market organisation system, but that, as a result of the resolutions on the health check, the use of these market management instruments will be stopped by 2012 at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">The steps that have been decided on will represent a major setback for this sector. Only the future will tell whether cultivating starch potatoes can remain competitive under the new rules. Even if there is no alternative to a greater market focus and less state intervention, we need to consider appropriate transitional periods in order to allow for an organised changeover. In addition, we should help farmers who want to continue growing starch potatoes to increase their competitiveness and to find new markets and sales opportunities. However, we should also provide support for farmers who decide to stop growing this crop in identifying alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most important thing is for the Commission to make a rapid decision and to issue a clear statement on the problem. In the world of business, a good decision is always good and a bad decision is a challenge, but the worst thing is for no decision to be taken at all. A failure to take a decision means a standstill and for a business, standing still can be fatal. Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission once again to consider the situation and to find suitable means and opportunities which are in the interest of our farmers.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in an ideal world, things would be running just as we predicted at the time of the health check. Unfortunately, that has not been the case with the potato starch sector. If, at the moment, we were to carry out our plans in the situation that we currently face, then we would have a whole lot of companies going bankrupt, because prices are too low. The big question is: is that a price worth paying? I do not think so. I think that the European potato starch sector is a special sector. We have made huge progress in the field of biochemistry, with all sorts of new products being developed, and I do not think that we should interrupt that process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission’s replies do not give me cause for too much optimism. I would like to ask the Commission to review the situation once again in order to initiate intensive dialogue with this sector. I join many of you in calling for a soft landing, and indeed we must ensure that a soft landing is provided, because I think that the potato starch sector has to survive, as it is a special sector. For that to become a reality, the Commission will have to take special measures.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the previous parliamentary term, I served twice as rapporteur for the regulation which established the size of starch quotas. At that time, I had many meetings with representatives of the sector, and tried to take account of the wishes of countries which were unhappy with quotas which were too low. We gave attention to the fact that the sector was very much out of sync and that we could not disturb this because otherwise, the entire branch would have had enormous problems. Today, we are hearing that the sector is in danger, and may even disappear entirely, and I am greatly afraid that this might happen. It is with sadness that I view the problems that have faced other big sectors in turn: problems in the dairy industry, the almost complete eradication of the tobacco production industry, and before that, the reform of the sugar market, which also ended with disastrous consequences for farmers. Now these problems are affecting the potato starch sector. I think it is high time to consider a change of direction in agricultural policy in the European Union, a trend which was established in conditions which were slightly different than they are today. I have doubts as to whether the principle which has been followed up till now is still relevant.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we have been producing potato starch on my farm for many years, and – in common with many tens of thousands of farmers throughout the European Union – I fear that the ending of production quotas for starch and the withdrawal of support for its production, both from producers and from processors, will cause a drastic worsening of their economic situation in 2013. In relation to this, I am in favour of maintaining the system of potato starch production quotas and the guaranteed minimum price and supplementary payments for agricultural producers. If these instruments are abolished in the starch sector, this must be combined with measures to ensure appropriate financial support for restructuring. Mr Dalli’s reference to the reform of the sugar market is unfortunate, because that proved to be a disaster for Europe and, in fact, only helped the great landowners of South America. That is not the way to go, Commissioner. There is still time for common sense.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a 20% reduction in greenhouse emissions, a 20% share for renewable energy, with 10% of fuels coming from renewable sources. These are the challenging objectives set by the European Union to combat climate change and to achieve independence in energy supplies.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the question of how we can meet these objectives remains open. This is particularly true if the sectors which can make a contribution in this respect are allowed to waste away. Agriculture can, and will, make a significant contribution to the 2020 goals. However, in specific areas of agriculture, policy is increasingly moving away from market management. As a result of the health check, changes will take place in the starch potato sector which will cause a massive fall in production. The phasing out of the quota system and the minimum price have put the sector under huge pressure. We must make sure that a soft landing is possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must call on the Commission to identify measures to make starch potato production secure, in particular, in regions where there are no alternatives. The products of the potato starch industry will be of major importance in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the early bird catches the worm and the late bird catches the eye, so thank you for facilitating me.</p>
      <p sl="en">I come from Ireland, where the potato is very dear to people’s hearts because, prior to the Great Famine, it fed the population. When the potato blight came in 1847, four million out of eight million people died as a result. Ever since, no meal has been complete without a potato or a ‘spud’ as we call it in Ireland. So anything that jeopardises the future of potato farmers would send a shiver down the spine of Irish people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Individuals here have spoken – and I share their concerns – about the future of the potato industry and, as the Commissioner pointed out, in the newly funded CAP, post-2013, the potato sector would have to be given very careful consideration. That is quite correct.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the House very much for this interesting debate. I share the opinion that the potato starch industry can play an important role in the future development of bio-plastics and other green chemistry products. I can also understand the fears expressed that the end of decoupled support and of the quota system might cause some adaptation problems for potato starch producers. However, we have to take into due account the budgetary framework we are operating in, the given legal framework, and the timeframe.</p>
      <p sl="en">DG AGRI will soon receive an evaluation study on the potato and cereal starch sector in the EU, and the discussions on the future of the CAP after 2013 are ongoing. I am convinced that in this framework, a better, more efficient and more sustainable solution can be found than any ad hoc measures could achieve under the current framework.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have three comments to make. I address my first comment to Mr Kelly and his heartfelt plea on behalf of the potato. We are talking here about potatoes which are marginally different from those served at your table, namely starch potatoes. However, these problems are related, of course, because, at the same time as the starch potato industry is collapsing, production in the consumption potato industry is increasing, and that is causing problems in the market.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second comment concerns the Commissioner, who just keeps saying: it will not work, but the potato starch industry has come up with proposals for how we might be able to reach a solution. The message we are sending out is: please, make sure you treat those proposals with some impartiality, because, even though this debate is about the post-2013 period, continually referring to the situation post-2013 is not helpful. That is exactly what the Commissioner has been doing. Then it will be too late. This sector risks collapsing in 2012. We will need a transitional regime in 2012 and 2013, so that this sector can once again be included in the ordinary agricultural policy due to take effect in 2014.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is my heartfelt cry to the Commissioner.</p>
