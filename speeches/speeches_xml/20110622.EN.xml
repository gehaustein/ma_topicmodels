At the time, we sent messages to the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council telling them to discuss the Russian elections. We have now been informed that one party in Russia has been denied registration. On the other hand, the OSCE has informed us that they have been permitted to send observers to oversee the elections. We would like to receive a statement on the state of affairs in Russia as soon as possible. We also want to have a debate on this. I think that would be appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session. Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple. The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated. As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these. The necessary translations were not available, either. We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are looking at a package that has had last-minute changes made to it by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, which have not yet been translated into the various languages. First of all, there is only one version – at least, I have only had access to an English version – which does not give us an exact picture of what happened. The second issue is that the facts involved are vitally important and the consequences are very serious for our countries and our peoples, not least bearing in mind the situations that are now being experienced here in the European Union, for instance in Greece and Ireland and, as is being announced, Portugal. We therefore think a more careful approach to these issues is required. That is why we insist that we need to put off voting on them until July.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, this is the last occasion I have to address this House on behalf of the Council in a plenary debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In January, we promised to run a Parliament-friendly Presidency. Aware of the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, we realised that close cooperation with the European Parliament and its members would be essential for the success of any Presidency in the future. The European public looks to the EU for results, without bothering too much with distinguishing between Parliament, Commission and Council. And they are right in doing so. We have a common responsibility and therefore our success or failure is shared.</p>
      <p sl="en">The forthcoming European Council marks the end of the Hungarian Presidency. Therefore, this debate is a golden opportunity to give an account of what it has achieved on a number of dossiers, in close cooperation with this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with economic policy. The European Council will bring the first European Semester to a conclusion. It brings together in one policy cycle the two arms of economic recovery: financial stability that is based on fiscal consolidation, reflected in stability and convergence programmes, and structural reforms for a smart, sustainable, socially-inclusive and job-creating growth. Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Commission, Council and Member States in handling national reform programmes and recommendations, the first European Semester has lasted a semester, and not a day longer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council will be invited to endorse the country-specific recommendations approved by the Council, which should be reflected by all Member States in their national decisions as regards their budgets and structural reforms. Even in the trialogue negotiations, we included a reference to the European semester so that Parliament could be duly informed of these developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Euro Plus Pact, most of the Member States participating have presented commitments amounting to more than a hundred separate measures in total. Those commitments are a good step towards achieving the objectives of the Pact, which must now be implemented at the national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the degree of ambition and precision of these initial commitments is uneven. In preparing their next commitments, Member States will ensure a broader scope, a more concrete approach and a higher degree of ambition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me now to turn to the six legislative proposals on economic governance, called the ‘six-pack’ in our common jargon. I will not go into detail as it is on the plenary agenda in its own right. Let me just remind you that the Hungarian Presidency was given a mandate by the European Council to reach political agreement with Parliament by the end of June. After the adoption of a general approach by the Council in March, we got down to business immediately, engaging in intense trialogue negotiations with Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The three institutions have done immense work. The initial position of Parliament carried approximately 2 000 amendments. By now, we have managed to reduce the outstanding issues to one single major issue and some technicalities. I am convinced that the text we have on the table now is stronger and more suited to preventing future crises. We will inform the President of the European Council accordingly, thus reporting back to the body which gave us this mission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been personally involved in fascinating talks with many members of this House. I take this opportunity to thank you all sincerely for this experience. As a Parliament-friendly Presidency, we hope that the results which have brought us to the verge of agreement will not be wasted. The financial markets, European business and, most importantly, our fellow European citizens, expect us to show responsibility and decide and act against indebtedness – the chief predicament of our economies. Finally, we know too that the issue of Greece will be also on the agenda of the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to Justice and Home Affairs. The European Council will address strategic issues relating to asylum, migration and Schengen; building on the conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 9 June 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of recent developments, the European Council will discuss ideas and provide more political guidance and cooperation in the Schengen area. It will also discuss ideas as regards a possible safeguard mechanism. But let me stress that the good functioning of Schengen requires Member States to fully implement the rules and thus enhance mutual trust among themselves. It also requires an effective and updated monitoring and evaluation system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me touch upon the free movement of persons. It belongs to a different chapter of the acquis comunautaire than Schengen, yet they are inextricably linked. Both belong to the most visible and popular achievements of European integration. The Member States are aware of this and fully intend to safeguard them. The logic behind Schengen is unchanged: ever more efficient management of the external border is the precondition for travelling without border controls within the Schengen zone.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, there have been intensive negotiations on the Frontex Amending Regulation. We have in Frontex a European tool par excellence which is essential for controlling our external borders. The Presidency welcomes the positive result of the most recent trialogue meeting. Member States are discussing the results this afternoon and we are optimistic that an agreement can be reached in time for the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the European Asylum policy: recent developments have put this under strain. Safe and efficient asylum procedures are required for people in need of protection. It is therefore crucial for the Common European Asylum System to be completed by 2012 – a system based on high protection standards combined with fair and effective procedures capable of preventing abuse and allowing for rapid examination of asylum applications in order to ensure its sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council will also review the progress on the preparation of the plans for capacity development to manage migration flows and refugee flows. The objective must be to address the root causes of irregular migration. To that end, partnerships will be developed with Southern Neighbourhood countries. As a first step, a wide-ranging structured dialogue on migration, mobility and security will be established with those countries, with the aim of securing tangible benefits for them as well as for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now say some words on Croatia. Closing the accession negotiations with Croatia was listed among the top priorities of our Presidency. As a result of the tremendous efforts made by Croatia, the Commission and the Presidency with the essential support of this House – for which it deserves immense credit – the European Council will call for the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia by the end of June 2011. The signing of the Accession Treaty before the end of the year is being envisaged.</p>
      <p sl="en">These developments bring a new momentum to the European perspective of the Western Balkans. The European Council will return to this matter at its December 2011 meeting. In this context, it is expected to welcome the arrest of General Mladić and his transfer to The Hague. Serbia has taken a giant step towards EU accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Southern Neighbourhood: the European Council is expected to endorse the new approach to relations with the EU neighbours which was agreed at Monday’s Foreign Affairs Council. Given the serious developments in parts of the Union’s southern neighbourhood, the European Council is also expected to adopt a declaration on recent events in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among other issues, let me inform you that the European Council is expected to appoint Mario Draghi as the next Governor of the European Central Bank on whom this house takes a vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, the European Council is likely to endorse the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies, thus realising two further priorities of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danube Strategy is designed to enhance opportunities for an entire region that embraces a diversity of Member States and third countries in the Western Balkans – nations, peoples and communities alike. With the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies, we will tackle the plight of the Roma people for the first time at European level and turn it into an opportunity for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">A special thanks to this House for producing such an excellent report – the Járóka report – and the decision, which was an excellent base for our work in the Council. Europe thus will show that, in the words of Prime Minister Orbán, it ‘has a heart and not only a brain’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, the Hungarian Presidency chose ‘Strong Europe’ as a motto. Let me express hope that you will agree with the judgment of President Buzek, who recently said ‘after the Hungarian Presidency Europe will be stronger and better’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, for your cooperation in the last six months.</p>

    <intervention id="3-026-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this week’s European Council has a very substantive agenda. Minister Győri has presented the agenda in general, on behalf of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council. I wish to thank her, at this juncture, for the commitment shown over the course of these six months.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me focus on some specific points: I have written a letter to the members of the European Council outlining the positions of the Commission on what I believe are the most important items on the agenda, and I would like to share our positions with you. At the end I will also make some comments regarding Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">This European Council will take very important steps towards ensuring that the European Union’s economic policy-making is both more coherent and more effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we have the economic governance package. I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue. Later this afternoon, Commissioner Rehn, on behalf of the Commission, will express our detailed positions on these extremely important matters. Now I expect Parliament and the Member States to come to an agreement, because the adoption of the governance package is fundamental to our comprehensive response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Agreement on this package is vital. It will be extremely difficult to explain to our citizens why we are not able to agree on the fundamental pillars of the response to this crisis when we are trying to respond to challenges of the current magnitude. I believe the agreement on this package will strengthen our economic surveillance mechanisms at European level. It will make the European Union far better placed to prevent the development of unsustainable public debt and deficits, and the emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances. Although prevention is better than cure, we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I expect the Heads of State and Government to endorse the country-specific recommendations that the Commission presented on 7 June. This is, as you know, the first time we are carrying out this kind of collective exercise at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recommendations are based on an extensive analysis by the Commission of Member States’ plans for sustainable growth and job creation, married to sound public finances. They are focused, measurable and tailored to each country’s most pressing challenges. Of course, discussions between the Commission and the Member States on these recommendations have sometimes been very intense, but I am pleased that the overall result has maintained the high level of ambition.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot reap the benefits of the single market on the one hand and ignore reckless economic policy-making on the other. There is no point in signing off on a brand new economic governance package if, the very same week, Member States question the methodology and independent Commission recommendations in the country-specific exercise. This new way of policy-making is also a strong appeal for collective responsibility, because the European Union’s economic space is so much more than the sum of our different economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the European Council is due to endorse the treaty change needed to allow for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism in 2013, with its capacity to assist – on the basis of strict conditionality – euro area Member States in financial difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ESM, combined with the increase of the effective lending capacity of the EFSF, is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguard the stability of the euro area on the basis of sound and sustainable public finances.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may remember that, in January when the Commission presented the annual growth survey, a very important topic was the need to reinforce the effective lending capacity of the EFSF. At that time we were very much criticised, but now – unanimously – the governments of Europe have decided to increase the effective lending capacity. I wonder if it would not have been possible to approve it some months ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">The economic governance package, country-specific recommendations and the stability mechanisms: this is how Europe should seriously draw the lessons from the crisis and act upon them. The Commission will do its utmost to maintain this level of steadfast resolve in all matters to be discussed.</p>
      <p sl="en">To respond to the economic crisis, every sector needs to contribute, and none more so than the financial sector. I have promised Parliament that the Commission will bring forward a formal legislative proposal on a financial tax.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal will have three aims. Firstly, to avoid fragmentation of the internal market for financial services, because there are an increasing number of uncoordinated national tax measures being put in place. Secondly, this financial tax also aims to create appropriate disincentives for overly-risky or purely speculative transactions. Thirdly, to ensure that financial institutions make a fair and substantive contribution to the sharing of the costs of the recent crisis, as well as to address concerns about excessive profits.</p>
      <p sl="en">The very high bonuses that are still being paid to bankers – bankers who have sometimes been saved thanks to huge amounts of taxpayers’ money – suggest that there are excessive profits in the banking sector and that the banking sector should also contribute to the common public good.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">The second major issue for the European Council is migration. The issue of migration has come to the fore in recent months, particularly under the pressure of recent events in the southern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="en">I spoke to Parliament in May about the Commission’s migration package, which sets recent and future policy initiatives in a framework that allows the EU and its Member States to manage asylum, migration and mobility of third-country nationals in a secure environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Migration, let us face it, is a very emotive issue. But let me state clearly that the Commission will not accept any attempts to undermine the Schengen principles. In fact, I think that we will see exactly the opposite, through a reinforcement of the European approach to migration and free movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has proposed strengthening the governance of the Schengen area, thereby reinforcing Member States’ confidence and trust in the effective management of our external borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will be done both through strengthening the Frontex border agency and through an evaluation mechanism whereby national border agencies will work jointly on assessing threats. We are also exploring the feasibility of a safeguard system which would allow the adoption of decisions at European level to confront possible difficult situations where our common external borders are subject to exceptional pressure or where Member States are failing to comply with their obligations to control their borders. Decisions on the best way to handle such situations should be taken at European Union level, avoiding unilateral action by Member States. As a last-resort mechanism, and if the critical situation justifies it, these decisions could make provision for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls, but always within a Community framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">This does not mean rolling back the abolition of internal borders. This is a way of strengthening the European dimension of the system so that individual Member States do not feel pressured into acting unilaterally. I will be looking for clear backing for this approach from the European Council, so that detailed Commission proposals can be finalised and have an opportunity to succeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The migration package is completed by proposals for a common, efficient and protective asylum system which guarantees asylum seekers equal treatment across the European Union. I am confident that Parliament and the Council will endorse the proposals set out in the Commission’s reviewed proposals on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and on refugee status. I will call on the European Council to lend its support to the completion of the entirety of the asylum package as quickly as possible within the agreed deadline.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council has also discussed the situation in our neighbourhood, in particular the implementation of the Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean. This partnership is extremely important to our Arab partners, who are looking to the European Union to support the democratic transitions in the southern Mediterranean. We must not let them down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another item on the upcoming European Council agenda is the Commission’s recommendation that Croatia become the 28th Member State of the European Union, hopefully by 1 July 2013. There is still substantial work to be done, but I hope that at the end of the month we can sign off on the remaining chapters in the Accession Conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word about Greece, because I hope Member States will also have the occasion to discuss at the highest level this situation, which is important not only for a Member State of our Union but, I believe, for the stability of the euro area and for the stability of the European Union as a whole. The issue of Greece raises very important issues, not just in terms of financial stability, but also in terms of social commitment and in terms of the political determination of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last night’s vote in the Greek Parliament allows the government to build consensus in support of the reform package, agreed with the European Union and IMF, of fiscal measures, privatisations and reforms that are necessary in Greece’s journey back to growth. Because, let us be absolutely clear, there is no alternative to this plan. So let us act upon it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that many people in Greece are living through a period of great hardship and uncertainty. My message to the Greek people is that if the government acts, Europe will deliver. If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF, we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth. Fiscal consolidation is entirely necessary, but the goal is growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should never forget that one euro spent on interest rates to pay the debt is one euro that cannot go to the people of Greece, so it is critically important to reduce debt and to control the deficit so that we can restore confidence in the Greek economy, in order to promote growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is extremely important that the Greek people understand that in the face of such difficult circumstances a national consensus is necessary: a national consensus and not short-sighted partisan politics. We need a national consensus in Greece so that Greece can win the confidence of the partners and the markets in terms of the very important reforms that are needed.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">On Monday night I met with Prime Minister Papandreou, and we also discussed a more strategic use of our European structural funds. Greece has the potential to access a significant amount of European funds under the cohesion policy. I believe we should increase their rate of absorption and accelerate those funds, aiming for a significant impact on improving competitiveness and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will be done within the existing funds. It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance focused on growth and jobs, but with an emergency character because – I repeat – Greece is living in an emergency situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will discuss these issues with the European Council: what we can do together with Greece. We, the Commission, can put this in place, bilaterally with the government, but I believe efforts are necessary from all those that can contribute, namely in terms of technical assistance coming from different Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Greek Government is ready to engage with us in this approach. I believe we should also be ready to react in a very positive way, always on the basis of strict conditionality regarding the necessary reforms for that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implementation of Greece’s reform plans calls for exceptional efforts from the Greek people. The Commission is now proposing an exceptional response as a sign to the Greek people that there is hope. They are making sacrifices, and we know they are making sacrifices, but at the end of that road there is hope, and solutions are within their reach. They are making some important cuts, but those cuts are necessary for growth. Growth is the answer, and we will work with the Greek authorities and the Greek people to achieve that objective.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility – and I stress the word responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the situation that they – and indeed many other countries in Europe – are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means. This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term. This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end. This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country’s twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking – that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) – or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up. It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial. We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves – and when I say ‘us’, I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity. However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past. When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity. We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with. If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th Member State in a few months’ time. This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend. This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now. However, the values that Europe embodies – solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity – have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely has the European Parliament prepared for a European Council meeting during a worse crisis. I believe that we should be under no illusions. This European Council meeting will be a historic one, because it will decide on the future of this Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I read an interesting line in a German newspaper this week. The markets – writes the German newspaper – distrust the European Union because they no longer trust it to find solutions to the problems. The people of Europe, the citizens, distrust the European Union because they no longer trust the governments to find solutions to their problems. We are in a severe crisis. We are in a crisis of confidence in the European project. We all have the crisis that we deserve. Our problems have been known for a long time. The question is whether we intend to address them in a bold or a despondent way, and whether we have courage to do so or whether cowardice will bring us to our knees.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will say one thing, which is perhaps one of the most unpopular messages that could be given in Europe right now. I will say it nevertheless, because I am firmly convinced that it is right. We do not need less Europe, we need more of it! We need more courage to overcome the crisis using European resources.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Why do we need more Europe? This Council meeting is mainly about two things. Firstly, the Heads of State or Government must regain their governance, because it is not the Heads of State or Government alone that decide. In this world in which we live there are 43 companies with a balance sheet totalling more than the national budget of a medium-sized EU Member State like Poland. That means that there are 43 heads of companies that are at least as powerful as the Polish Prime Minister. These people also decide on the fate of the people of this continent. Has the fact actually ever been discussed – and this is another issue – that always right on time just prior to an Ecofin meeting, just before a European Council, one, two or three credit rating agencies assess whatever is on the table as a solution to the problems as being inappropriate? Who in actual fact are the people who are wielding the real power over economic development in Europe? Who is behind them?</p>
      <p sl="de">Who is actually paying the credit rating agencies for their ratings? They are clearly not working simply for a reward in heaven. Of course, they receive money for their proposals from stakeholders. The Heads of State or Government must have the courage to regain the sovereignty of their national, democratic power to act. The only way that they can do this is by uniting.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">They will not be able to do this if they split into their constituent parts. The EU currently has 7.8% of the world’s population in its 27 Member States. Population statistics tell us that in 2050 only 4% of the world’s population will live here. The remaining 96% of the world’s population will not only take their bearings from Europe. The emerging powers and the emerging economies of this world are not waiting for Europe to split into its constituent parts, from large parts like Germany down to very small parts like Malta, in the belief that each individual part will be able to survive on its own – the renationalisation rhetoric that many politicians are giving their people. We will only survive in intercontinental competition – environmental, economic, financial and monetary – if we unite. If we have the shared will to make the strongest economy in the world – because that is what Europe is if it holds together – into a success by standing together in solidarity. Solidarity means sharing. Strong shoulders more so than weak shoulders. For us, incidentally, that does not mean a financial tax; it means a financial transaction tax. If I go to the supermarket and buy a carton of milk, I pay value added tax. If I sell a financial product, I pay no tax. That is not right. Therefore we need this financial transaction tax.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">All of these things have been explained. They are on the table. Either we will manage to knit Europe together in unity and not play one nation off against the others, or play the feelings of one off against the feelings of the others, or the European integration project is in real danger. However, if the European Union fails as a transnational project for securing peace and prosperity and breaks apart, then it will be more than just a political union that breaks apart. Then the demons of the 20th century that plunged this continent into misery will quickly reappear. The defence of Europe is more than one European summit, it is the defence of a great idea.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-033-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all the key question of this debate today is what we can expect from this European Council on Thursday and on Friday. What I hope, and what my group is hoping – as, I think, are the majority in this Parliament – is that we can end this Summit with a more decisive, more comprehensive and bolder approach to the current crisis. Let us be honest, we do not have a global comprehensive approach to this current crisis. It is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would say to Martin Schulz that I also have some questions about rating agencies and the role they are playing in the current crisis, but let us try to find errors and the sources of the crisis within our own ranks, and maybe not outside the European Union and outside its institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us be honest about another thing: the crisis is not over. Those who think that by giving some additional money to Greece this crisis will come to an end – as regards Greece and the euro – are wrong. This crisis is not over, and this crisis will continue if, first of all, we do not find a structural solution for Greece and, secondly, if we do not create a real, economic and political union in Europe. Such measures should end the crisis as regards the euro and Greece.</p>
      <p sl="de">Again, is it possible to have one currency and 17 governments, 17 economic strategies and 17 bond markets – as we have today and is a situation which does not exist elsewhere in the world? It is only us in Europe who think that we can have one monetary union and 17 different policies, 17 different governments and 17 different bond markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not only us – the federalists in the European Parliament – who are saying that. Yesterday, Mr Lipsky, the current Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that Europe should create one political and economic union to face this crisis. Yesterday it was Mr Geithner, the US Minister of Finance, who was saying ‘maybe they can stop and talk with each other; let them create an economic and political union’. If they know on the other side of the Atlantic what we have to do, why do we not have the courage to take this enormous step forward to an economic and political union? That is the key question for the tomorrow’s Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards my second point, we need to help Greece – and not only in a defensive way. We need a bold austerity programme, and that is currently what is being discussed with the Greek Government. Maybe there are plans to go further than what is on the table now. If so, we need a positive plan for it.</p>
      <p sl="de">They cannot emerge from the crisis based only on austerity. They need to have growth and investment and we can deliver on that within the European Union. Let us, for example, give guarantees for private investment. Private investment no longer exists in Greece. Let us give them loans from the European Investment Bank. Why not use part of the privatisation programme not for fiscal consolidation but to create new investment and growth in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="de">I now have a request for Mr Daul, and will therefore continue in French.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am going to make my comment in French. Mr Daul’s group comprises members of the Nea Dimokratia party. We need to be very clear on that. Moreover, if we want all the other countries to give money to Greece, we also need a political consensus to be reached in Greece. I believe that we can call on Mr Daul, who was right in what he said, to convince his political friends to reach this political consensus in order to deliver this policy for Greece.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is what we need. I am well aware that it is an onerous task that we are setting you, Mr Daul, but I know that you are capable of rising to this challenge. It is true that a country in such a situation yearns for political unity, and it is not by playing petty political games, as is currently the case in Greece, that this situation will be resolved. I experienced this in Belgium for nine years, Mr Lange.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, let us be very honest. We need a bolder economic governance package than we have on the table today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to ask President Barroso something directly: yesterday, the spokesman for the European Commission said at the press conference that there was no need for more reverse QMV in the governance package. I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to rectify this. I would ask that the Commission, together with the European Parliament, employ a more Communitarian method for the economic governance package.</p>

    <intervention id="3-036-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-037-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in most of the countries to which Mr Daul was referring, we are in a coalition with the Christian Democrats, so that certainly must have an impact. However, I do not think it appropriate, this afternoon before such an important Council meeting, to play the party political card by pitting one particular government against another. I urge you, Mr Daul, not to pit the liberals against the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) or against the socialists. What I was asking of you was to convince your friends from the Nea Dimokratia, a party of which, incidentally, many of the members are also our friends and have even, in some cases, moved over to my group, and which has only one aim: to unite the people of Greece so that they can emerge from the crisis they are going through. You can play a major role in this. I am counting on you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I was delighted to hear Mr Verhofstadt say that everyone now realises that Greece’s problem is a European problem. What does Greece have a duty to do? Greece has a duty to push ahead with major structural reforms and privatisations.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should therefore like to advise Mr Verhofstadt, because he has obviously been misled, that on these two issues, which form the cornerstone of the reforms, Nea Dimokratia has not only agreed; it was Nea Dimokratia that made the proposals. These are Nea Dimokratia proposals, which the government has been unable to implement for 18 months now. That is the truth.</p>

    <intervention id="3-039-000" speaker_id="23706" name="Miloslav Ransdorf" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I listened attentively to Mr Verhofstadt, the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I would like to ask him whether I am correct in thinking that his motto might be that Greece is everywhere, since Greece is not just a Member State of the European Union, but is actually a state of mind, and that Greece is therefore everywhere.</p>

    <intervention id="3-040-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is obvious that if we do not resolve the Greek problem we will have huge problems in the whole euro zone. We already have problems in Portugal today; we already have problems in Ireland today. The difference in spreads today – between Portugal and Germany, between Ireland and Germany – is more than 800 basic points.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what we are doing – with the solidarity that we needed from the beginning of this crisis but which was not there – is not only for Greece; it has to be for all Member States of the euro zone. It was because of this lack of solidarity that, in December 2009, we created a far bigger problem – the problem we are facing today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is very entertaining today in the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are still, let me remind you, a lot of us who experienced Communism and who since then have made enormous and swift progress to prepare ourselves for membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were rightly made to prove ourselves, to prove that we met the Copenhagen criteria, to prove that we enjoyed fully-functioning market economies and so on and so forth, but unfortunately this level of scrutiny was not applied to some European countries when entering the euro zone. Why? Simply because it was constructed as a political and not as an economic project, and therefore the criteria were ignored; figures were changed to bring in countries that were not yet ready. That is the core of the problem, and now we are living out the consequences and we are at a turning point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Believe me, despite the fact that most members of my group are from non-euro zone member countries, we do not want the euro to fail. At the same time, it cannot be defended at any cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are surely on the final pages of the bail-out chapter. This European Council should send a clear signal that if a country’s position is unsustainable within the euro zone then, unless it makes dramatic changes, the euro zone should not hesitate to raise the possibility of restructuring its debt or even – however cruel it might seem – of its leaving the club.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, if you do not do that, then I will tell you what will happen next: your opponents – or rather the opponents of your successor – will not be nice, decent Eurosceptics like me, but really nasty anti-Europeans. And why? Because they will be elected by angry German taxpayers and by desperate French and Dutch private entrepreneurs fed up of paying other people’s debts, and I know that neither you nor I want this to happen. So let us act accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the same way, I would ask you to please stop using or misusing every crisis as an opportunity to pursue further the supra-nationalistic agenda towards something like fiscal union or tax union, because it leads us nowhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a crisis of Europe. This is just a crisis of one wrong, outdated concept of European integration, and that is all.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, I am amazed at how raucous the debate on the deepest crisis that the European Union has experienced for a long time has suddenly become. When we realise that we are currently defending Schengen, that we have been unable to defend the freedom of the press in Hungary during this Council Presidency, that we needed a long time even to begin to find a common European language with regard to Libya and Egypt, then it is no wonder that, in the face of the worsening situation in Greece, all we can say is that, although we now have many leaders in Europe, we have no leadership.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that that is one of the major problems that has not been properly addressed. In this crisis that has lasted much longer than the Greek crisis, we are also in a situation where all of the solutions that the Council comes up with are coming too late and are too narrow in scope. The idea that the European Union can only continue in the way that we want it to and also provide a better life for all Europeans if we rescue Greece and stabilise the South is one that has not been communicated at all up to now, and I believe there is actually an institution responsible for this and that is the European Council. I would say that Parliament is not always a shining example, either. For example, Parliament refused to come together in good time prior to this historic Council meeting to adopt a resolution to address the problems relating precisely to this historic crisis. I found it very regrettable that even those Members on the left who sit here to my right were not able to gather themselves together in good time to make a statement on behalf of Parliament with regard to Greece.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece, because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia. However, with regard to justice, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also has a responsibility towards Mr Papandreou and his government. As pleased as I am that he received a vote of confidence yesterday, the Greek Government will also be involved in deciding on fair programmes in the crisis. The fact that this is so unfairly distributed, that the burden is only being borne by the lower sections of society, that no capital levy is being introduced in Greece and that tax evasion is also widespread in Greece is an unfair situation. The national solidarity that was mentioned must also result in the elite in Greece, who are after all even today still profiting from the crisis, also taking their share of the responsibility.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We stick by everything that we have already said on many occasions with regard to Greece. Longer timeframes, more favourable loans – we believe that there also needs to be a gentle, systematic and secure rescheduling of debt. I believe that it is an expression of the incompetence of the political leadership in the European Union that what we have recognised to be right, namely that private creditors must also share the burden, is not implemented because we are afraid of the credit rating agencies. Therefore, the issue that brought us into this crisis is still the dominating factor and so far there has been no political leadership to tackle this. I believe that this is the main issue that needs to be discussed during the European Council meeting in the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, I wish you luck with your plan for fairer taxation as a way out of the crisis. I do not know whether you are still pursuing the financial transaction tax. We are still in favour of it. This Parliament has expressed its support for this many times. However, I also believe that tax evasion, unfair bonuses and all the factors that helped to cause the financial crash have not as yet been addressed. That is also your responsibility. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something. Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before. Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded. At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model. Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things. However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets. The consequences can still be felt today. I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks. In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told. In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop.</p>
      <p sl="de">Things will just carry on as before. The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy. However, we lack the courage to do this. The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with. That is where the problem lies. We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors. This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be ‘let us carry on as before’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, ‘no no, there is no problem’. Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, ‘there is no alternative’. We must continue down this route. We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next. What a fine mess you have got us into. You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won’t. It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months’ time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package. They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression. They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy. They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse. You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return. Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work. Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts. If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, last Tuesday Mr Barroso said that Greece can count on European support. ‘Europe will deliver’, he said.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What does Mr Barroso actually base this power upon? Is it not the case that financial aid for Greece is expressly prohibited under the Treaty of Lisbon? Is it not the case that national parliaments have to approve such aid individually? Is it not the case that they are also allowed to say ‘no’?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The power of the Commission is expanding further and further. It is time we put a stop to that. The Commission sees itself as the governor of all European countries, as the ultimate decision-maker under the leadership of Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso was not elected democratically. No European citizen voted for this man. I have but one word for a government that rules without democracy, and that word is ‘dictatorship’. A bureaucratic dictatorship that wants to subjugate the Greeks and that also wants to call the shots in the Netherlands. It is unacceptable that Mr Barroso should decide whether the Netherlands should grant aid. There is only one body that can rule on whether the Netherlands should help Greece and that is the Dutch Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Granting aid to Greece is useless. It harms the Dutch economy and Dutch citizens. On that point, Mr Barroso was actually right. After all, on Tuesday, he also said himself that, even if the Greek debt disappeared by magic, the problem would not be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European summit really cannot reach any other conclusion. The only long-term solution to this problem is for the Greeks to reintroduce the drachma, which could be devalued on its own. That way, the other Member States would not have to pick up the tab.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would just like to answer two concrete questions that were put to me.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not enter into this ideological discussion against Europe in which, may I say, it is interesting to see the extreme right and extreme left united against the euro and against the European project. That is why I want once again to appeal to all the democratic forces in Europe, in this Parliament, in Greece, to unite in a consensus to do everything possible to ensure growth and prosperity in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The two concrete questions were about the financial tax and about our position on reverse qualified majority.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the financial tax, I want to confirm that the proposal that the Commission will put forward, probably in October, will be on a financial transaction tax. We have made an impact assessment. We believe there are two possibilities: a financial transaction tax and a financial activities tax. We have decided to come forward now with a proposal on a financial transaction tax, one reason being precisely that there is no equivalent of VAT for financial transactions. So we will come forward with that proposal by October.</p>
      <p sl="en">(Applause).</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue was raised by Mr Verhofstadt. I want to make it clear that the Commission supports Parliament on reverse qualified majority voting. We have been supporting your ambitious position. At the same time – and Olli Rehn will have the opportunity to address you later this afternoon – we will make a strong appeal to you and to the Council to see if it is possible to come to a final agreement. Because we also believe that, thanks to Parliament’s positions, great progress has been achieved in terms of the package that is now up for consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to congratulate you, the Parliament, those that have been working most on this matter, and also the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, as it has done some very important work as well. At the end, I want to say to all of you that, in terms of responsibility, the cost of not having an agreement on this matter will be extremely high, considering the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission supports the Community approach. The Commission supports the greatest possible ambition, which is the line that I think that you are also defining.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are the concrete answers to the concrete questions.</p>

    <intervention id="3-050-000" speaker_id="28229" name="Manfred Weber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece. I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would firstly like to say a few words on a subject that is close to my heart and that, of course, is Croatia. I hope that we will succeed in taking a decision to allow Croatia truly to be accepted into the European Union now. The Commission has done a good job here – Commissioner Füle, you yourself Mr Barroso and also the Hungarian Presidency in this regard. It would be a good and important signal to a problematic region like the Balkans if the country that has completed its task well were to be next in line. When I say ‘completed its task’ that does not mean that all of the problems are solved. We have just experienced some unacceptable situations in Split in connection with the Gay Parade. However, it is important for the government to stand up for fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to add a few words with regard to Greece. Mr Barroso, you said that it will be difficult to explain it to citizens if we do not come up with a solution, for example in connection with the economic governance package. However, Mr Barroso, it will also be difficult to explain it to citizens if we only concentrate on austerity. You talked about growth and said that we need something to promote growth – but what exactly, Mr Barroso? You cannot believe that austerity alone will lead to growth if we do not at the same time offer alternatives. Mr Verhofstadt mentioned a few problems. It is not only left-leaning economists – in its economics section yesterday, for example, Le Monde, which is not a left-leaning newspaper, made it quite clear: austerity on the one hand – yes, we need certain restrictions – but we also need growth and investment.</p>
      <p sl="de">When there is talk of privatisations, Mr Barroso, you know exactly how to force Greece quickly into a wave of privatisations now – just as Mr Bisky said, things are being sold off. However, we must give Greece time to privatise those things that it is sensible to do so at a point in time when it will receive an adequate amount of money for them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we have to say that we also need to invest some of the money. If you say that you want to release regional funds and resources from the Structural Funds then we need to move away from the obligation for cofinancing, because otherwise Greece will not be able to use them. These are all proposals that we are waiting for from the Commission, Mr Barroso. We are in favour of a frugal policy and of savings where these are necessary, and we are in favour of restrictions and restructuring measures. However, it will not work without growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the end of the day, if we carry on as we are, we will not rescue Greece or our banks, nor will we save our taxpayers; we will instead end up in chaos.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, Mr Barroso – and this of course applies to the Council, too – in addition to the structural measures, we also need growth. Proposals for growth and employment are crucial for the future of Greece and also for that of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in all of the countries that are experiencing a crisis, there have been genuine problems. There is absolutely no point in denying that. This situation can be abused from two different sides. It can be abused, as some credit rating agencies are doing, for example, by giving advice that drives countries to ruin. However, it can also be abused by making political statements to the effect that we do not need to change anything. If some of the demonstrators, in Greece for example or in other countries, believe that we do not need to change anything and that we can carry on as before, then they are wrong. We are therefore in favour of giving our full support to the measures proposed by Mr Papandreou’s government. These measures are a step in the right direction. They must be supported, and that is something that some of the trade unionists in Greece also need to recognise – the only way to overcome this is if, at the same time, we pursue a policy of growth together. I wanted to make that absolutely clear. In other words, no abuse from either side. That is extremely important.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild newspaper in Germany printed the headline ‘Greek leader has survived – Europe can breathe a sigh of relief’. I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week. That is the next big test. Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief. Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right. The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel. However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel. They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it. In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why a growth strategy is so important. That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy. That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece. Democracy has to endorse this. What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible. However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example. It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened. We must prevent future crises. This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in. No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means. To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not. Then we will not be able to support this package. Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the presence of large numbers of alleged asylum seekers from Libya and Tunisia will be on the agenda. Tunisia is a country that has toppled its dictator, so what are these Tunisians fleeing from? Democracy? Perhaps we should expect to see Mr Ben Ali, a recently retired dictator, at the head of the queue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Libya is a war zone. But people do not become asylum seekers simply because they live in a dangerous country. There must be something about that particular person that places that person in jeopardy. The argument seems to be about whether Italy or Malta should accept them for settlement because they are the first country they reached, or whether they should be accepted for settlement by other Member States. My answer is that neither should accept them for settlement and they should sooner or later be returned to North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">If EU asylum rules really say that a mere claim to be an asylum seeker is enough to create an obligation to accept them, then the rules must be changed. Rules are man-made and can be unmade. If that means Member States, and indeed the EU itself, repudiating other international agreements, then so be it. Member States have been changed beyond recognition by migration. The time has come to stop the flow and encourage its reversal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accession of Croatia is also on the agenda. What steps will the EU take to ensure the referendum will be held fairly, with both sides being heard and equal amounts of money being spent? I suspect that a free and fair referendum in not on the cards. The country will be deluged with EU propaganda and those arguing against Croatia’s accession will be phased out of the debate.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the next European Council meeting will also be about trust. We have reached a historic moment. It is historic, because we will identify the challenges that the European Union has to face, and to which we now have to give nothing but responsible answers. These answers, however, are closely interconnected.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First, however, I would like to congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on its great work and express my thanks for it. In particular, I would like to thank Minister of State Enikő Győri, who was always present everywhere, for her work. She set a strict timetable that the Presidency as a whole managed to keep, while maintaining a Parliament-friendly attitude, for which I thank them again.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This half-year has been a real challenge, because it was not only a new task for the Hungarian Presidency, but the tasks themselves were new as well. Just think about the initiation and institutionalisation of the European semester, and the ‘six-pack’ of economic governance, created within the framework of the co-decision procedure, that will bring a fundamentally new economic approach.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are great expectations towards the approaching Council meeting, and towards issues of the package that have yet to be resolved through compromise. At the same time, the Council and Parliament bear a huge responsibility over the agreement, because they have to decide whether they want to follow the bad practices that have lead to the weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and indirectly to the crisis as well, or put an end to the policy of agreements made at Member State level and bad bargains, and finally give space to a new economic policy approach that will offer common European solutions, is built on commonly established rules, and will finally complete the economic policy aspect of integration, with a strong Europe in focus. Citizens, national parliaments and the markets all expect the European Union to shape the European economy uniformly, following commonly accepted rules, to ensure the stability of the common currency and to protect European citizens from the crisis efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Members of the European Parliament fully understand that the debate on the European Council which is set to be held on 23 and 24 June will continue to focus on the persistent crisis and the problems faced by the euro, and Greece. However, I should like to join those who have pointed out that the agenda does not end there. We also have a duty to discuss the question marks raised over elements that are central to the area of freedom, justice and security, specifically Schengen, which is probably the key asset for the free movement of persons.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot allow the cry for democracy that has spread across North Africa to be met with anything other than a clear, categorical response. Moreover, this response cannot be a reform of the Schengen Treaty. On the contrary, it should be a strengthening of the Schengen Treaty. There are precedents clearly indicating that, faced with unexpected, abrupt migratory pressures, as was the case in the Canary Islands, in Spain, between 2004 and 2006, the response given cannot just be more, better Europe, but also a supportive contribution to the demand for better democracy in the neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">We know that Malta, Italy and France have been subjected to this pressure, but we have to be very clear that the Council must do its part by completing the asylum package, completing the immigration package, completing the reform of the Frontex Regulation and, not least, by updating the solidarity clause included in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which means updating Directive 2001/55/EC.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I should also like to express my concern about the message that has been sent out, aimed at instituting a response mechanism that will enable re-establishment of the Union’s internal borders in certain extraordinary circumstances. We must be extremely clear about what we are dealing with and what the European dimension will be, strictly in relation to the EU institutions, so that we will not find ourselves on a slippery, or indeed counterproductive, slope.</p>

In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims. We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen – perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country. In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway. They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in. Italy has received them. Italy. People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord party, which has received the refugees. Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely the complexity and, if you like, the toughness of the agenda for the Council of 24 June that bring us up against the shortcomings of the instruments available to us.</p>
      <p sl="it">What exactly is available to us? The European Union is. The European Union is a work in progress, an unfinished work, which we have so often failed to complete precisely because of our weakness and fear. The European Union is available to us, but the United States of Europe is not. That means that, when national governments are wavering due to internal issues, we do not have an instrument that we can activate in order to implement what might be a solution to our problems. To succeed in finally making the United States of Europe available to us will require leadership not only from the national governments but primarily from the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe – President Barroso is not here any more – that his prudence won him his second election. I would very much like to vote for him for a third time, but this time for his courage. In other words, as he has been re-elected once for his prudence, I would like to re-elect him for a third term for his courage. Therefore, given the tough agenda to be tackled by the Council on 24 June, I expect the leadership shown by the Commission and the European institutions to persuade the national governments to put our ideals before whatever is in our interests.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that is the only feasible way forward. Otherwise, we will continue to hold debates in which we grumble about the fact that perhaps the French Government has taken an initiative about Schengen for internal reasons, or the Italian Government has refused to admit someone or other, or the Greek Government is still too weak to really be able to take responsibility for its own decisions. The main issue, however, lies elsewhere: unless the political nature of the European project is clarified, we will be incapable of dealing with our problems.</p>

      <p sl="el">As developments over the last few days have illustrated, Greece is determined to continue with and make a success of its efforts to restructure its finances and promote structural reform. However, if these efforts are to be crowned with success, two conditions need to be satisfied. The first condition is that we must be able to give the people not just austerity, but also positive prospects, prospects of growth, prospects of employment and prospects of new jobs. The second condition is that we need an environment of security and support from the European Union, an environment of political cohesion because, throughout the crisis and, in particular, over the last few weeks, we have seen an informal public dialogue between European capitals, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, with the credit rating agencies acting as a strange sort of referee, in connection with the much talked about involvement of the private sector in the new Greek bail-out.</p>
      <p sl="el">This strange sort of refereeing does not do credit either to the European Union or to political union.

      <p sl="en">In an excellent article published in the Financial Times yesterday, Mario Monti deplored both the excessive deference to big Member States and the ‘culture of politeness’ in the Council, which meant that Member States refused to call each other to account for failings.

I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ‘mass influx of displaced persons’ under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent. Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I too would like to offer my warm congratulations to Minister Győri, President-in-Office of the Council, on her Presidency. I would also like to welcome the Vice-President of the European Commission and make two remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first concerns Greece. I think there is a need to consolidate the financial situation and to devise measures to promote growth. With regard to financial consolidation, it is clear that dealing with the past while planning for the future is extremely difficult. I propose the creation of a kind of credit mediator, which could house Greece’s bad debt in a suitable financial, or hive-off, structure. Since the political consensus we have reached is not to allow capital losses, why not split the Greek debt up and thus allow the Greek Government to manage the future and this mediator basically to sort out the past through restructuring?</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards interest rates, a contribution is required from the banks, which made huge profits by purchasing debts at 16% and then doubled their capital when they dropped to 8%. I also propose an investigation into financial transactions involving sovereign debt, which the European Securities and Markets Authority could be entrusted with carrying out. Credit institutions have to a certain extent provided what we call, in French law, a form of unfair assistance to an over-indebted structure. They are therefore guilty of misconduct and have caused harm: they need to make amends for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of growth, we must support President Barroso’s proposed EUR 1 billion plan, and we must deliver a proper development plan for Greece. I approve of the idea put forward by Mr Cohn-Bendit: why not focus on military expenditure, which accounts for 4% of GDP? Furthermore, if the European Union could arbitrate between Turkey and Cyprus, I believe we would save Greece 2% of its GDP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the kinds of measures which would help bring about a development plan for Greece.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, my expectations for the forthcoming Council are rather low, because division reigns in the European Union: instead of decision there is hesitation, and instead of solidarity there is selfishness. That is how Europe is going.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us look at the case of Greece. I am not going to talk about my own country, Portugal, because the new government has only just come to power. All I can do, therefore, is to wish it every success for the sakes both of the Portuguese and of Europe. Let us talk about Greece, then. Greece is not just any country. It has been a full Member of the European Union for decades, and it belongs to the Euro Group. It is important to remember that Greece was the cradle of democracy. These facts should be enough for Greece to be treated with greater respect by the European Union. The Greeks are responsible for the terrible situation that they are in, but so are the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr Papandreou, the Prime Minister, has done everything in his power to get out of this difficult situation. With enormous courage and dignity he has adopted the austerity measures, whether they are feasible or unfeasible. What is happening to Greece may one day apply to Ireland or Portugal, to Spain or Belgium, or to Italy or France. I have a question for the European institutions: how can countries in difficulties bear the scandalous interest rates imposed on them and at the same time reduce their budget deficit and public debt and promote economic growth and create jobs? Do you not think that with that kind of treatment these countries run the risk of dying not from the disease but from the cure?</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is not the right path. What is needed is a concerted plan to defend the single currency, to fight off speculation on sovereign debts and to denounce the rating agencies, which are primarily to blame for the crisis we are undergoing.</p>

    <intervention id="3-069-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles Goerens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the first precaution to be taken if we want to prevent a large-scale blaze is to stop playing with fire. I agree with President Barroso when he states that the Greek Government must do everything it can to put its house in order so that the European Union can, in turn, take action. In other words, Greece must regain its credibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Does the same call for responsible behaviour not deserve to be addressed to all the governments in the EU? Are all the political leaders aware of the impact of the statements they have made about Greece over the last 18 months? The time has come for the European Council to put a stop, tomorrow, to the discord among its members.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Four things are needed in order to prevent the Greek crisis from having a much-feared domino effect across the entire euro area: firstly, a united Greece with an economic and budgetary recovery plan; secondly, a European Union and a Euro Group which are united by the same objective; thirdly, a little more time than initially planned, particularly for privatisations; and fourthly, solidarity which is properly understood and which comprises not only new loans, but also, and above all, technical assistance from its partners, and in particular from the Commission.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-070-000" speaker_id="96903" name="Paulo Rangel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, first of all I must say that I am expecting some highly responsible decision making from this European Council, particularly in view of the economic climate we have been experiencing in recent weeks. It must be more responsible than the last Council, which tried to put a problem off for three months merely because of electoral timetables. What I expect from this responsible decision making is essentially for people to realise that economic and financial issues are crucial and decisive for Europe, but that they are instrumental for Europe’s primary purpose, which is to keep the peace.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If we take an approach to problems that only leads to the Member States beginning to mistrust each other, to sowing mistrust between the various states, to creating and exacerbating differences and rivalries between southern and northern states and between central and peripheral states, the end result will be the decline of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that what is at stake in this European Council, regardless of the technical solutions or political disagreements, is knowing whether or not we want the European project to continue to be a valid blueprint for a strategy for peace in Europe. I believe that is what is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What I notice in the speeches of many leaders, whether they are in countries in difficulties or countries that pay out and are net contributors, is an irresponsible discourse that often even appeals to certain extremely negative features of their nationalities. For that reason, and that reason alone, I appeal to the sense of responsibility of European government leaders to come up with solutions that enable Europe to find a way out and to resolve the situation.</p>

    <intervention id="3-071-000" speaker_id="4436" name="Gianni Pittella" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, mutual fear and mistrust – as Mr Mauro was saying just now – are guiding the decisions made by European governments on the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe looks to me like a football team that is losing 2-0 whose players think they can recover by not passing the ball any more and trying to score alone. No match can be won by playing alone, however. Not even Maradona or Pelé could win the match of this crisis by themselves. The Greek crisis could have been controlled in its early stages. Instead, we pressed on and have now reached a very tricky point, which must be tackled by leaving damaging jealousies and failed economic recipes behind once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should tell the truth and admit that many of today’s heads of government are proving to be second-rate leaders. They cannot understand that the crisis was certainly not caused by Greece or even by the sovereign debt situation, but by the financial markets, which until the other day were unregulated. Now the governments are again offering us the usual poisoned bait: let us sort out our public accounts and then we will see who is left alive. Nobody will be left alive, however, and above all the vital part of European society will not be left alive. Instead, we need to aim for growth by aiming and focusing resources on research, training and the major challenges, and starting a virtuous circle.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, we should speak plainly about immigration. Schengen should not be touched; at most it can be strengthened, but it should not be touched because it is an inalienable achievement that keeps the European Union standing. Migrant flows must be governed from Brussels in a way that rewards inclusion, solidarity and security.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Council will bring the Hungarian Presidency to an end. The efforts of this Presidency should be commended for completing important dossiers, including some extremely controversial ones.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is a very important meeting because it will be seen whether the European semester is going to be implemented. The recommendations must be applied by Member States to prevent stability being jeopardised. Now is the time when Member States need to prove their responsible commitment to abiding by the new mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Stability or convergence programmes and domestic reform programmes are needed, but are not enough. Agreement must be reached on the meaning of economic governance. Parliament has achieved a compromise with great effort, which I hope will be supported by the vote tomorrow. It is the Council’s turn to adopt this package of paramount importance to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Schengen area has been a major talking point recently. The evaluation mechanism obviously needs to be revamped. Reintroducing borders unilaterally is not a solution. If a Member State is unable to meet its external border responsibilities, support measures and the involvement of Frontex are required.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If the situation is not resolved, the Council, at the Commission’s suggestion, can decide by qualified majority to reintroduce border controls for a limited period. I believe that introducing borders unilaterally, as is happening at the moment, is not a solution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Approval of the Presidency’s report on the means for promoting Roma inclusion in the European Union and of the conclusions concerning the launch of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region may mark important steps in the implementation of these vital policies for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the weakness of the Stability Pact has been one factor in this deepening economic crisis, which has grown into a credibility crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nobody is blameless in this respect. We have now reached an emergency situation where solidarity and responsibility are all that count, but solidarity does not just mean all for one. In exactly the same way it means one for all. Every Member State has to take responsibility for the ownership of our Union and start acting for the common good of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do need more Europe, and more Europe means more discipline, including concrete measures against those who continue to violate the rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">To restore the euro zone’s credibility, the Commission’s role has to be to become both stronger and more independent in exercising economic governance and conducting surveillance. The Commission needs a mandate to assess the economic situation in the Member States, so it can issue recommendations and warnings in time.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the crucial issue will be the political will and ability to apply fines. Their application should become a rule, not an object of political bargaining. The role of the Council should be duly limited, in procedures that lead to potential sanctions. The EU’s credibility can be restored by improving the quality of statistics, excluding in the future any manipulation and falsifying of fiscal data.</p>
      <p sl="en">My country, Estonia, faced a deep economic crisis three years ago. However, we acted, balanced the budget and entered the euro zone. Latvia acted too and is clearly back on track.</p>
      <p sl="en">All for one and one for all. We all have to act in reforming our societies. Cutting expenses hurts, but remains the only way back to growth and stability.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have heard a lot today about giving and giving and giving and cutting and cutting and cutting. I want to add another dimension to the mix, and that is ‘taking and taking and taking’. I am referring in particular to the interest rate being charged by the ECB to my own country, Ireland. We are struggling manfully to reach our targets in relation to the bail-out. But this is not helping us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thankfully, the EP and the Commission see that we are being unjustly and unfairly treated. Charging an interest rate like the one we are being charged is akin to tying a millstone around the neck of a drowning man while you are sending out the lifeboat to save him.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask, particularly tomorrow, for the Council to reduce the interest rate on Ireland. If it does so, we will return to growth, we will meet our commitments and we will be a great nation, part of Europe once again.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the European Council will hopefully endorse the three successful objectives of the Hungarian Presidency: the Danube strategy, the Roma strategy and the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia. The key objective, however, would be the adoption of the ‘six-pack,’ the legislative package on economic governance. Hungarian experts and diplomats deserve the highest praise for their great work, because they managed to reduce the number of issues between the Council and the European Parliament to only a few. In order to break the deadlock of the negotiations, the Hungarian Government needs to achieve compromises at the highest possible level. Whether the government of Viktor Orbán has enough political capital to do so, however, is still in question. Is Mr Matolcsy, who had openly and harshly attacked the European semester before, able to argue credibly in favour of strengthening economic governance? I hope that we can still reach a breakthrough in the Council. Europe needs the introduction of economic governance as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, what the serious economic and social situation affecting several Member States of the Union deserves from this forthcoming June European Council is very careful consideration, deep reflection on its causes, and acceptance of responsibility for the increasingly neoliberal Union policies, such as privatisations and the devaluing of labour, which are causing more social inequality, greater economic divergence, and more unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The Council members are indifferent to the struggle of workers and ordinary people and, unfortunately, what they are proposing is to make permanent the neoliberal policies that have already led to serious crises in Greece and Ireland and are threatening Portugal and other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the end, what they are trying to do is to make it easier to gain more profit from capital and from greater financial speculation, and always at the expense of the same groups as ever: workers, micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers and people affected by these investment cuts and austerity policies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU’s current migration policy has failed. An example of this is the Commission’s plans for so-called mobility partnerships in order to give the mass influx of people from North Africa a semblance of legality. Mrs Malmström has declared many times that Europe is allegedly dependent on immigration from North Africa. However, the fact that many Member States are having to deal with high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, is deliberately ignored. In Libya, the population has doubled in the last 20 years. Thus, if the gates to North Africa were opened, the pressure on the European labour market would increase further. Therefore, we do not need more immigration from North Africa, but rather a stop to immigration altogether. Our citizens do not want mobility partnerships in this regard; instead they want readmission partnerships. Our fellow citizens do not want open borders, but rather the reintroduction of controls and a strengthening of Frontex. This also ought to be considered at the forthcoming Council meeting when ‘progress’ in immigration policy is discussed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we have spent most of our time discussing the crisis in Greece, and quite rightly so, for it is an enormous problem. Yet during yesterday’s debate, Mr Barroso also asked us for our support on the Schengen issue. The fact that Mr Barroso has asked us in Parliament for our support means that he must be anticipating a very difficult situation, and difficult talks with the heads of the various governments. I would like to say that the Schengen area, and the freedom it brings to travel around Europe, was a symbol of freedom and of the European Union, and one of the chief assets and greatest merits of the European Union, for me personally, as a Pole, and for all Polish people. We cannot allow this freedom to be limited, or for the Schengen area to disintegrate, for it is precisely decisions and policies of this kind that determine how the EU is perceived. Therefore I would call not only for the Schengen system to be defended, but also for Romania and Bulgaria to be included, or rather involved in this system as soon as possible.</p>

It is apparent that after so many months of debates on the situation in Europe, we have come to the conclusion firstly that there is a very high level of threat, and secondly that cooperation is necessary. In connection with this, I was happy to hear Mr Barroso say today that a proposal will be submitted regarding a tax on financial transactions. I am pleased that this is the case. It is a shame that we are not already working with a final draft, but the fact that a draft exists is very much to be welcomed. If I may, I should like to emphasise one more matter: for the time being we are focusing on the euro area, but we also have a ‘non-euro area’ in the European Union, and we should ensure that this does not experience problems either.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, on the immigration issue, we expect three things tomorrow. Firstly, that the Schengen Area is defended because it represents freedom for our citizens and constitutes one of the most visible elements for European Union citizens. Secondly, we expect shared responsibility on the external borders too, not just on the internal ones. This will require a stronger Frontex Agency, as well as increased solidarity and the parcelling out of responsibilities in a fair and just manner. It will also necessitate greater cooperation with the Southern Mediterranean countries that have undergone revolutions. Above all, what we need most of all tomorrow is true political will. If this is lacking then we will never practise what we preach.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today’s lively and animated debate is clear proof that the agenda of the European Council is highly relevant and critically important for the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greece was very much present in most of our interventions. We know that the situation in Greece is very difficult and that there are no easy solutions. I agree with all of you who said that it is very important to demonstrate to the Greek people that it is not only about cuts and austerity, but that there is also light at the end of the tunnel and that we can actually help Greece to get back onto the path of growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Austerity must therefore be accompanied by pro-growth policies and measures. I am absolutely sure that the European Union and the Commission can do that. We can help Greece to increase administrative capacity. We can help Greece to absorb structural funds better and put them in strategic pro-growth sectors, and we can help the Greek authorities to improve the quality of their tax collection.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know how to help countries improve their educational systems. I think we can all do it now, and the Commission is ready to proceed in that way. We are prepared to put together technical assistance programmes which will accompany the difficult austerity measures the Greek authorities have to go through. By this, we would like to show clearly that Europe cares; Europe is solidarity and Europe can help if the country is in such distress.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the same message needs to come from the Greek political establishment. We can do our best, but what we need from the Greek authorities is a clear show of unity, and a clear show of resolve to tackle the difficult issues in that country. This would be my appeal and the appeal of the Commission to the Greek political representatives: cooperate, show us unity, show us a united approach to the very difficult issues. The time is right and this would be a highly responsible gesture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not many of you touched upon the very important element of the conclusion of the European semester. However, I will mention it here because we need the help of the members of the European Parliament to go back to their constituencies and explain that the European semester is over and national semesters are starting. I think we know what to do; we have country-specific recommendations which are very fair, very honest and very detailed for each Member State, but now we need the cooperation of the national authorities and of the national governments to actually deliver and to carry out the reforms in the Member States. Only by this will we change the quality and competitiveness of the European economy for the better and put the European economy on new wheels.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to confirm once again that a financial transaction tax will be proposed by the European Commission. We needed to carry out a very thorough impact assessment and that is about to be concluded. This will be one of our proposals, and one of our inputs into the global debate on these very important issues. Again, Europe will provide leadership on this issue and we hope that our global partners will follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you referred to the Schengen area and to the importance of having high quality immigration policies in place. I would like to assure you that we are absolutely aware of the fact that freedom and the rights of persons to free movement within Europe is one of the most important achievements, and we should treasure it. The Commission will act as the guardian of the treaties and would be ready to act if the basic foundations of these projects are called into question.</p>
      <p sl="en">After recent developments, we also have to acknowledge that we need a complex solution for all aspects of migration and that we need to consolidate trust in the system. Therefore, the Commission is convinced that only a coordinated and Community-based process is adequate as opposed to unilateral initiatives by Member States to re-introduce internal border controls.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need a common European Asylum System that is more efficient and more protective. We will do our utmost to ensure that the system is up and running by 2012. This is the Commission’s approach and I hope that it will be supported by the European Parliament and by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please allow me a few short words on economic governance and the ‘six pack’. You have already heard the position of the Commission President and you will have a chance to discuss this issue in greater detail with my fellow Commissioner, Olli Rehn. I would underline only one element and that is the importance of having an agreement sooner rather than later, because time is pressing and we need our new tools in order to govern European economies in better and more reliable ways in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">A concluding remark on Croatia. I think that it is time and it is appropriate to congratulate Croatia, because it is approaching a historical moment and I believe that this should give a very positive signal, not only for all Croatians, but for all the peoples of the western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to congratulate the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which did an excellent job of pushing this so far forward, enabling us to have these very good results at this time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last word of thanks goes to Ms Enikő Győri. She said many times that she wanted to lead a parliament-friendly Presidency. I think she has proved it with her frequent presence in this House. I would also like to thank her for her excellent cooperation with the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me use my mother tongue this last time that I participate in the plenary session. First of all, I would like to thank you all for recognising our work, as we could hear many MEPs from various groups conclude that the Hungarian Presidency did a good job. I personally believe that it is indeed worth leading a Parliament-friendly Presidency in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">President Barroso alluded to the ‘six-pack,’ and Vice-President Šefčovič mentioned the negotiations with Croatia and the different dossiers. The existence of the co-decision procedure in the European Union gives the Council and the Presidency the opportunity to build personal relations with a large number of Members, and to raise mutual awareness within the institutions of each other’s problems, which I believe is a great opportunity for us all.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thank you for organising this debate today. I believe that we agree on the fundamental principles and basic values, of which much has been said today, and even European integration philosophies have been discussed, and I have to say that most of the Members’ speeches reflected this agreement between us. We also agree that the European Council has to tackle extremely difficult issues today. I would be more careful when using the word ‘historical’, because I think we depreciate the concept if we use it too often.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I strongly agree that fear and mistrust are bad counsellors, and EU leaders should not be led by these emotions during the meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. It is my credo, and that of the Hungarian Presidency as well, that we have to base all our steps on trust – and I would even say mutual trust –, on taking responsibility and on solidarity, just like you have urged us. Whether it be about economic policy, Schengen reforms, asylum or enlargement, this is what we must build on. The solution – as proposed by the great majority – is more Europe, a stronger Europe; the Hungarian Presidency has been working for the last six months with this in mind. It is indeed our firm belief that deeper integration is the solution to our common problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, I would like to report on the issues which were given to the Hungarian Presidency as homework by the previous European Councils, and more specifically: what results and achievements will be presented at the summit starting tomorrow, because, after all, we had to make a deal about specific dossiers with you and we had to reach agreement on other issues as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me start with economic issues. We have already talked about the European semester, and I would like to thank Vice-President Šefčovič, because it is really worth informing the public about what the semester means. It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member States manage themselves, so that we may send them warning signals in time. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament followed this practice with close attention; in this European semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter budgetary management, and, at the same time, we lay down the basis for the practice of seeking growth in hard work and creativity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As far as the ‘six-pack’ is concerned, there will be an in-depth debate on it soon in this House. Let me give you two reasons why I would prefer the adoption of the current agreement. Firstly, because this package is good. It is better than the initial Council proposal, and because Parliament was given concessions by the Council on every single issue on its agenda. We have even achieved concessions on reverse qualified majority voting. So, I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff’s opinion that the whole package has only one tooth, namely reverse QMV. The advantage of this package is indeed that it builds several checks and balances into the system, through which crises like the one of 2008 can be avoided in the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As far as free movement of persons is concerned, let me tell you that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 June the Hungarian Presidency unanimously adopted a conclusion stating that free movement has to be preserved, that we need to revise the measures already available to us, and only after we have exhausted them and only if new problems actually arise, requiring the adjustment of our current acquis, can we take extraordinary measures in extraordinary situations, and that the modalities should only be elaborated once there is a concrete legislative proposal at hand, which, as far as I know, will happen this autumn.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I have just received news that parallel to this plenary session the Council agreed on the only open question regarding Frontex, so the negotiations on the strengthening of Frontex have been concluded with success. I thank Parliament for their cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The other homework given by the European Council was to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank, and in this regard we were able to come to an agreement with this Parliament, which is another success we achieved, and I believe this was an important step towards the reconciliation of the situation in the countries of North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a quick side note, I must respond to the words of Mr Tabajdi. I must reject his remarks concerning the members of the Hungarian Government, which I think are based on domestic political motivations. First, I would like to ask you to inquire from your colleagues in the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the work of Minister for National Economy György Matolcsy, because the atmosphere in the hearing yesterday was slightly different from what you have talked about here today. I would also recommend that you read the responses of the Member States to the Commission’s proposals concerning the European semester. Everyone is free to react and criticise the content, because everything works out through debates and interchanges of opinions in the European Union, and it is true that many Member States have criticised the content already. Second, I would like to point out to you one of the positive traits of the Hungarian Presidency, the key to our success in reaching agreements with European institutions on so many issues, namely respect for the Treaties and for the competence of the institutions. We submit the ‘six-pack’ to the Council in the knowledge that the Hungarian Presidency has done everything it could to come to an agreement, as praised by President Barroso and by your colleagues in this House in committee meetings. Therefore, we now submit the package to the European Council, whose President’s name is Herman Van Rompuy, and who will decide on a course of action.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last but not least, I would like to talk about the accession of Croatia. As I said at the beginning, I am careful with the use of the word ‘historical’. However, in the case of Croatia I think we have indeed come to a historical moment, because we are sending a very important message to the Western Balkans, namely that they have a future in the European Union. I truly hope that the heads of EU Member States and governments will take the political decision tomorrow and the day after tomorrow about the accession of Croatia, and that the negotiations can be concluded in the final hours of the Hungarian Presidency, on 30 June at the latest. The European Commission worked around the clock to be able to issue a positive report on 10 June. I can assure you that both the Croatians and the Hungarian Presidency have been working day and night to make this happen. We have had Council working group meetings every day to enable us to complete the work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, I would like to thank not only this House – which I have done already – but also our partners in the trio, Spain and Belgium, for their excellent cooperation and for the fact that we were able to complete the 18-month trio programme, and may I wish Poland all the best and a Parliament-friendly Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The forthcoming European Council is of particular importance because the two great facets of European integration will be at the heart of the debates. The first is economic integration in the shape of the economic governance package, which should make it possible to find the best solutions for getting out of the economic and financial crisis, as well as concrete measures for the countries in especially difficult economic situations; to this end the Council should send out a clear message of solidarity and responsibility. Secondly, this period of troubles and great migratory pressures that we are experiencing cannot serve as an excuse for weakening the great success of Schengen, a synonym for freedom of movement. We cannot do a U-turn on this success, but instead we must protect, strengthen and develop it. I hope this Council sends out a strong, clear message to this effect, emphasising that the Member States need to respect and implement the Schengen rules properly and effectively. It must draw attention to the need to improve solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities among Member States, and to increase the powers and resources of Frontex. It must also stress the need to set up a real evaluation mechanism for Schengen that will check compliance with the rules and border controls, identify problems, help solve them and, as a last resort, penalise Member States if they persist in not complying.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The dramatic effects of the so-called austerity measures are highly visible. As many people warned a year ago, the International Monetary Fund-European Union (IMF-EU) programme for Greece has not only caused economic disaster and social devastation, but it has proved incapable of fulfilling the very objectives that allegedly justified it: the deficit reduction targets have not been met, the country’s public debt must be around 170% at the moment and the interest rates that the markets require on the public debt have soared. Nonetheless, the European Council is preparing a fresh assault. In addition to the identically tailored IMF-EU programmes that they want to implement in Ireland and now Portugal, they are preparing to reinforce the attack on Greece, squeezing its people even further.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are the latest steps in this process of interference and extortion, which is openly colonial in complexion. They intend to use economic governance to institutionalise and make permanent the interventionist policies and measures associated with current, ongoing examples of IMF-EU meddling. They want ‘cross-compliance’ to become permanent, as well as external control over national accounts and policies, which are closely supervised by the major EU powers. Infringement (or even a mere threat of infringement) of their dictates would result in heavy penalties. These are unacceptable developments that show how retrograde, reactionary and anti-democratic this European Union really is.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are at a crucial moment, when Europe’s economic future is being decided in the shape of the economic governance package. Furthermore, in several days’ time the EU will decide on the next tranche of economic aid for Greece. In my opinion, if we are to exit the crisis then we need greater economic integration within Europe, not additional sanctions or restrictions. Today’s European Union comprises both the euro area and the remaining countries, and while the euro area itself admittedly shares one currency, it is also made up of 17 bond markets and 17 governments’ development strategies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is therefore in favour of adopting positive solutions, such as closer economic integration. We also believe that the burden should fall on those who are responsible for the economic crisis, hence the idea of a tax on financial transactions, and not those who are its victims, for example the citizens of Greece.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The current European Council meeting is also the last during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, which has not earned the praise that should be due to it, since a number of concrete projects on the EU’s agenda upon which the Hungarians have worked, including those concerning economic governance, have been overshadowed by political issues, such as the media law or the Hungarian constitution. I hope that Poland, which is next in line to take over the presidency, will not follow the example of our neighbours, and that the election campaign for the Sejm will not overshadow its successes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be. It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies, and the consequences of the Arab revolutions, at Europe’s borders. If we have chosen to seize this opportunity in order to strengthen external border checks, then it should be said straight away that we have picked the wrong target again. It is not enough simply to pursue a repressive policy which we know is ineffective and causes great human suffering. Let us remember that there are people in need of protection at Europe’s doors, doors which remain closed to them under the false pretexts of cost and abuse. Following the recent World Refugee Day, let us insist, above all, on our responsibilities as Europeans, responsibilities which the Member States are, wrongly, afraid to shoulder. Otherwise the 2012 deadline, to which those same Member States have committed themselves, may well be missed.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are preparing for a busy European Council meeting which will, in my opinion, be even of historic importance. The Hungarian Presidency has some important success stories under its belt: the Danube strategy and the adoption of the Roma strategy. However, I do hope that after the good quality work they have done on a professional level, they will have enough political weight and agility to reach important goals in other areas, such as the Croatian accession, migration and the very pressing issue of economic governance. They have to work hard to achieve an understanding between 27 Member States, to reflect Europe’s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration. I am impressed that my country’s first EU Presidency happens to be during such a challenging period and I hope that the European Council this week will live up to the expectations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Whereas the immigration world champion Canada attracts more highly qualified migrants than any other region of the world – in which regard, those who are not able to make a living are also quick to leave again – Europe almost pursues a policy of ‘compassionate migration for the unqualified’. The fact is that the majority of Africans who come to Europe are not refugees, they are economic migrants. This human horse trading under the false heading of ‘refugees’ as well as the humanitarian call for asylum is causing irreparable damage to the asylum system.</p>
      <p sl="de">A European asylum policy is doomed to failure on account of the undesirable side effects of previous proposals: the Dublin Regulation was intended to prevent asylum tourism. Now, countries with easily accessible external borders are swamped, but the majority of asylum seekers nevertheless are landing in the countries with the most generous social security systems. The fact that granting asylum seekers equality with the national population in terms of access to the labour market and social security has boosted economic migration was only to be expected.</p>
      <p sl="de">The increased rights of illegal immigrants make deportation almost impossible. A uniform asylum law would only be desirable if it was based on the most stringent national asylum law, like that of Denmark for example, and if there were consequences for contraventions of the law, like the tourist visa for illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">A European asylum system based on the central principles of humanitarianism and muddling through is to be firmly rejected. There must finally be a clear differentiation between refugees with a right to asylum and economic migrants. Moreover, Frontex and readmission agreements must be developed further and illegal immigrants must consistently be deported.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In view of the European Council meeting on 23-24 June, I would like to raise the issue of Croatia’s accession. I would first of all like to say how pleased I am that my position, supported by an amendment to the resolution on the 2010 progress report for Croatia, tabled along with my colleague Bernd Posselt, is in the process of becoming a reality. This is why I welcome the agreement reached within the General Affairs Council on concluding negotiations with Croatia by the end of this month. I hope that the European Council will formalise this matter. After six years of negotiations, the time has come for recognition to be given to Croatia’s efforts in meeting the accession criteria. I hope that in 2013 we can welcome Croatia as the 28th Member State. The Council’s decision will send an extremely strong signal to the Western Balkans as a whole, encouraging the governments in this region to continue their reforms. This is a long process which requires sacrifices to be made. However, the integration efforts are rewarded in the end. At the same time, I welcome the positive attitude shown by the Croatian authorities to the use of the monitoring mechanism up until the actual time of accession as an additional incentive. However, there should be no option for extending its use after this date.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Schengen area will be one of the issues discussed at the Council’s forthcoming meeting. In this context, I would like to draw the House’s attention to the ever-increasing number of people talking about the reintroduction of border checks. Denmark was planning to take a decision to this effect. The reasons given, namely the fight against cross-border crime and the increase in illegal immigration, are very serious problems, but they cannot be solved by closing the borders. This course of action runs counter to EU regulations on the free movement of goods and services. It will also result in a rise in xenophobia and a growth in the influence of parties proclaiming populist and nationalist slogans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What we need most of all is joint and more effective solutions for protecting the EU’s external borders and uniform standards for all Member States as far as immigration policy is concerned. In this context, I would call on the European Commission either to uphold its resolute opposition to a reintroduction of border checks or to establish joint, uniform and reasonable rules, criteria and mechanisms for a possible reintroduction.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Secondly, the Schengen area is one of the EU’s biggest achievements, the principles of which must be observed and defended. In this context, I think that restoring border controls within the Schengen area is not acceptable, nor is the introduction of additional criteria for Member States which would like to join the Schengen area and fulfil the specific technical criteria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thirdly, I welcome the European Council’s adoption of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region. There is a long history of cooperation in the Danube region. One of the first European institutions, the European Danube Commission, was founded in 1856, with its headquarters in Galaţi, in Romania, its aim being to ensure freedom of navigation on the Danube. I call on the relevant Member States to give priority to the implementation of this strategy, thereby ensuring economic and social development for more than 120 million citizens living in this macro-region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I call on the European Council and Member States to remove the current barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers. Lifting these barriers means respect for the EU’s fundamental principles such as the free movement of persons and solidarity.</p>

With regard to the Greek crisis, it is finally to be made clear that the European Union does not just stand for ‘give’ or ‘take’ but that it works on the principle of ‘give and take’. However, that also means that if a country receives help, this country must also follow the measures that are put in place for this purpose. The improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact is very much to be welcomed, simply to prevent any further financial disasters being experienced by a Member State. With regard to the planned accession of Croatia, the fact that Croatia fulfils the accession criteria is something to be welcomed, but it nevertheless has to be asked how the funding of approximately EUR 500 million to which Croatia is entitled is actually to be financed.</p>

    <intervention id="3-093-000" speaker_id="2323" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Dess, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future (2011/2051(INI)) (A7-0202/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-094-000" speaker_id="28228" name="Albert Deß" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide. The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy. The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report clearly states – and here we support the Commissioner – that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period. I cannot understand President Barroso’s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar. I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise. We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States. That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition. We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums. The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers. The importance of young farmers is mentioned. From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy. A large majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Dess, honourable Members, this report has come at a pivotal time, just as the Commission is drafting detailed legislative proposals that it plans to present to Parliament and the Council in October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, for his work over past weeks and months. I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their hard work and the fruitful discussions that we have had since I began the task of preparing the reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many elements in the report are in line with the Commission’s vision as set out in the communication on reforming the common agricultural policy, which was presented at the end of 2010 and was intended to spark debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am thinking in particular of the question of food security, which is one of agriculture’s underlying aims. I am also thinking of the importance of preserving the two pillars of the common agricultural policy, as Mr Dess has just said, whilst also recognising the need to make the policy greener and to focus more on integrating the sound management of natural resources. I am also referring to a fairer distribution of common agricultural policy money between European farmers and to the need for a budget that is able to address food and regional issues, but also the management of natural resources in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also note that you have included a proposal for higher ceilings for direct payments. At this stage, let me stress the considerable contribution that many large farms make to rural employment. Criteria such as employment will therefore be taken into account when we define the ceilings for agricultural income aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Adding a green component to the first pillar in conjunction with a stronger rural development policy is another key objective that will help to tackle climate change and environmental issues, but will also contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased to see that the report stresses the importance of closer links between direct payments and conservation of natural resources. I want to establish an effective, pan-European instrument that achieves the objective of simplifying the direct payment system. I am a strong advocate of decoupling direct payments, which has proved beneficial in helping farmers to adapt better to market conditions. However, I share the view expressed in your report, namely that we need to be practical and realistic. In certain situations, specific segments and sectors that are economically, ecologically and socially sensitive, I feel that optional coupled aid should also be available.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Direct payments will continue to play an important role in maintaining regional vitality. This is a particular challenge in areas with significant natural limitations. That is why the Commission communication stressed the value of providing income aid in addition to the second pillar payments made to areas with natural constraints, which will continue to be awarded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will examine the concerns expressed in your report, which suggests that this component should not be included under the first pillar. In the communication on the future of the common agricultural policy, I suggested creating a specific support scheme for small farmers, which would help them by minimising the administrative red tape associated with direct aid. Under the second pillar, small farmers could also receive significant support for restructuring or to allow them to contribute more at a territorial level, but also in economic terms, by becoming more profitable and more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Limiting direct payments to active farmers is another point on which your expectations and my vision of the future common agricultural policy coincide. Here again, we want to establish a European definition that can also allow for the specific conditions in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also paid close attention to your proposals on market measures. Strengthening management capacity and the negotiating power of producers and producer organisations, transparent pricing and other risk-management measures are all subjects that I am committed to examining in detail as part of the impact assessment. I intend to develop specific legislative proposals on these points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with your comments on improving and enhancing rural development measures. I also agree that we need measures that will allow us to respond more effectively to challenges associated with global warming, biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second pillar of the future common agricultural policy will have to address all these challenges and will also have to consider how technical knowledge can be used to build a future that combines competitiveness and environmental concerns. I can tell you that the entire Commission – the full College of Commissioners, including President Barroso – is in favour of a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was interested to read your proposals regarding young farmers. Rural development policy must provide a wide range of support measures that will meet their needs. I would also like to consider what could be done under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy for young farmers. In future, I would like Member States to be able to define thematic sub-programmes: packages of measures which specifically target young farmers and recognise that they are a priority group in the Member State. I am thinking of measures for setting up, vocational training, training services, investing in modernisation and restructuring farms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you emphasise in your report, our policy will need adequate funding if it is to address future challenges. We are currently waiting for the Commission communication on the next multiannual financial framework, which will be published by the end of June. We will build on that communication when we present our impact assessment and legislative proposals in the autumn, as I said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you once again for this report. I am happy to answer any questions. I hope that this will be a very productive discussion.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating the common agricultural policy. A lot of people criticise the common agricultural policy, because they believe that it has caused environmental damage and has in the past and even today continues to put developing countries at risk on numerous counts, especially in terms of agriculture and development.</p>
      <p sl="el">Those who levy this criticism are right, but those calling for a reduction in funding for the common agricultural policy are wrong. The common agricultural policy is not just a policy for agriculture; it is an instrument for redistributing resources from the towns of Europe to the countryside. It is the European citizens in the countryside who take care of our forests, rivers and lakes and who give us food, clean air and water.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to provide incentives for them to make changes where changes are needed. However, if we want to apply serious policy, we should increase funding for our agricultural policy, for a fairer, more effective and more viable common agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to ask European citizens what they expect from European politics they would answer quality of life, using terms like health and environment. With this common agricultural policy, we are facing precisely this task of fulfilling these expectations of European citizens in us as politicians, but also in politics in general.</p>
      <p sl="de">The contribution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is an important one in this context, because we want the same things European citizens do. We want wholesome food produced in a diverse system, and by diverse I do mean biological diversity, but also diversity in terms of production.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must enable the preservation of the environment in which we live. We need to take care of our water bodies, the air and the soil. We need to ensure that the rural habitat continues to be developed and does not become the poorhouse of Europe. We need to pursue an agricultural policy that involves the development of all regions.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, my apologies! Please start timing. I wish to present a number of comments from the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. It is a shame that they were not fully incorporated into the report of the Committee on Agriculture. They are as follows. Food security at EU and global level and globalisation necessitate a new and strong common agricultural policy, which will firstly improve our competitiveness on the international market, secondly ensure a fair income for farmers, thirdly ensure that consumers can buy high-quality products at fair prices, fourthly ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and fifthly help to improve the state of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to accomplish these tasks, objective, transparent and simplified criteria need to be established, which guarantee equal support for farmers in all Member States under the direct payments system. It is time to move away from the use of historical payments. The CAP should incorporate measures for regulation of and intervention in the agricultural market, and a risk management mechanism.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text. In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament’s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010. The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years. Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell. They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe’s 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world. Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Dess’s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture’s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation. By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities. Parliament’s approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world. Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As with Mr Lyon’s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important. As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission’s communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe’s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security. That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today. We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level. At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe’s food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition. Let us not lose sight of that fact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy. Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues. In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support. At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment – I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment – and, of course, the production of public goods. This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions. I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament’s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level. That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar. We cannot accept a budget cut.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think the world-renowned Scottish poet Rabbie Burns might have described this report as a bit of a ‘cow’rin, tim’rous beastie’ in its original form. Thankfully, through the good work that Albert Dess and all the other shadow rapporteurs have put in over the last months of negotiations, we now have a report that has some real substance and one that has many areas that we can support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe, however, that it falls short in one important area, in that it fails to answer the fundamental question asked by our taxpayers and our consumers who pay for the common agricultural policy: what are the direct decoupled payments for? That is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to. There is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled. There is a link to public goods through cross-compliance, but I do not think this fundamentally answers that question. I believe that the report should perhaps have gone a little further in responding to that question by backing the idea of a more targeted direct payment, containing a major incentive to develop a more sustainable and competitive model of agriculture, and giving the possibility of a targeting of payments at LFA areas – the so-called greening of the direct payments, which I believe the Commissioner is very much favour of.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we move down that road, I believe it gives us the ability to respond to that question and explain to the public exactly what direct payments are for. It also negates the call for caps and ceilings to be put on aids because, if there are public goods attached to the direct payments across all the direct payments, then the bigger the farmer, the more public goods that farmer will deliver. So there is no need to cap them. I believe that the report hints at that direction and I welcome the move towards that type of model. I hope we can improve the report tomorrow. If we do so, our group will certainly be happy to support it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I also take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur. He certainly proved during the time that negotiations were going on that he had a very big back indeed, because there were a lot of people throwing knives at him during that period. So he proved to be very resilient in his task, and he got there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing I want to do is to welcome the fact that it is going to be a Pillar Two structure, because I think that is what we are all agreed on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I listened to the talk about greening. When you speak about greening it means different things to different people in different countries, including how it is applied. We have got to get our heads around this somehow. It is not a simple throw-away line that you can use in some way or other, because it is going to have a tremendous effect down the line.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Le Foll is right. If the money is not there at the end of the day, there is little we can do in many of these areas. We have got to be responsible, and we have got to be responsible as a Parliament as we move towards the legal text that the Commissioner will bring forward in the late autumn of this year. That is going to be a tremendous challenge for us in this Parliament. For the first time we are going to have a responsibility, a say, and be part of the final decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="en">So from that point of view, I am opposed to the present text when it talks about capping. I will be supporting the amendments that have been put forward to reduce the degree. This is something that we have got to talk about more but, as I said, it will all be no good if the budget is not there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have got to look at how we spend the money. Are we spending our money as wisely as we can? Is there not too much of it going on administration? Is there not too much going on bureaucracy and red tape? And is not enough being given towards food security? Again like greening, people talk about food security as a throw-away line.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are we doing to achieve food security? We could be facing a crisis in the next nine or ten years. There are fewer farmers, fewer people working; this is where I think we have to concentrate in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, the report takes us clearly in the right direction. European agricultural policy needs to be fairer, and it needs to be fairer to the environment. I believe that we have achieved these objectives with the report. At the end of the day, European agricultural policy must meet our objectives on climate and diversity. This, too, is incorporated into the report. European agricultural policy needs to deliver environmental services. Then taxpayers will be prepared to pay for it. We need a fair distribution between farms, but also between the Member States, and we need to practise a fair trade policy towards less developed countries. This, too, is in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Working through nearly 1 300 amendments has been a laborious process, but in the long term we have achieved our aim of reaching a major common compromise with clearly defined objectives. Parliament has proved itself capable of making such policy. Many points could have been worded more clearly in our view, such as the terms for payments under the first pillar – crop rotation, protection of meadow land – but fine, it is now down to the Commission to flesh out the final arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that degressivity is included. Large farms need to deliver more when it comes to jobs and the environment. This was supported by a large majority in committee. It is also important that the role of farmers in trade is enhanced, and it is also important that the matter of the protein deficit is addressed. In the long term we cannot afford to import from other countries protein crops equivalent to 30 million hectares of feed area. It is high time that we made a start on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all agreed that a strong second pillar is important. Rural development, environmental measures and measures for less-favoured regions – there must be a clear emphasis on these. If Mr Barroso wishes to axe this point he will face huge opposition from Parliament. It is precisely here that the opportunities for rural development lie, and we cannot turn our backs on the less-favoured regions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the report presented today outlines a new direction for the common agricultural policy. It includes graduated public funding that reflects employment and environmental considerations, the fact that agriculture produces public goods and the concept of active farmers. However, we have seen too many good intentions that have never improved life for working farmers. Let us bear in mind the scenes being acted out right now in our rural areas. Although the idea of a safety net is attractive, it is not enough. We need to return to public intervention mechanisms in order to guarantee basic prices for small and medium-sized farmers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Bringing together economic, social and ecological efficiencies will also put an end to the ultra-liberal free trade model that is currently destroying family farms. The European Union needs to strive for radical changes in the World Trade Organisation and to work more closely with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) so as to return to cooperation systems that include variable customs duties at the border.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank and congratulate Mr Dess on the hard work he has put in, together with all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are particularly pleased that there are references in this report to less-favoured areas – mountainous areas are specially close to our hearts. We are particularly pleased that there is support for small farms, which are fundamental because they are of great importance both for protecting the land and for the quality of the products produced on them. We are also particularly pleased that there are substantial references to young farmers, who to some extent represent the future of agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should all be aware, however, that a major battle must now be fought over the budget, which is why we are appealing to you, Commissioner, as you know it better than I or anyone else here does. We cannot allow the common agricultural policy (CAP) to have its budget cut, because that would mean that agriculture is probably worth less in Europe. Clearly, if agriculture is worth less in Europe, then agricultural products and hence all our food is also worth less. That is not what we think, of course.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to mention the issue of imports. As you know, imports do not of course come into the CAP, but they make up another essential piece of the jigsaw that should go alongside the CAP, because if we import cheap, poor-quality products our agriculture is bound to collapse.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is estimated that, by 2050, we will need a 70% increase in global agricultural production. I would argue that the new CAP should aid this and keep that production within Europe. We should not be doing anything to hamper the food production base that we already have.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the clear support for the two-pillar structure and I also welcome today’s affirmation from the Commissioner of his support for that as well.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the hard work done by the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and the shadow rapporteurs – and I congratulate them all, of course – is today entering its final stage.</p>
      <p sl="it">A new common agricultural policy (CAP) means a lot to Europe for the future of its agriculture and the survival of vast rural areas. The new CAP must enable people to enjoy an adequate supply of quality food, as well as being able to sustain the production of non-marketable public assets. To achieve the goals indicated, there is a need for further, more effective and especially simpler instruments for farmers, together with easier access to funding and less red tape.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also need market instruments to combat effectively the unfortunately recurrent crises, and also instruments to prevent and insure against the risks inherent to agriculture. We need a CAP for young people, to whom we can entrust the agriculture of the future. We have decided to promote protection of biodiversity and of the countless regional and production specificities of the European Union through a rural development policy that will enhance all the natural and human potential of rural areas. At the same time we must seek to make farming businesses competitive. That is why I would like to impress on the Commission the need to include technology transfer measures in rural development.</p>
      <p sl="it">As approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I confirm the importance of supporting the introduction of ceilings for direct payments awarded to large economic players. I think the introduction of a system of degressivity of aid as the size of a holding increases above a certain threshold is necessary to avoid overcompensating larger holdings that already enjoy major economies of scale.</p>
      <p sl="it">I cannot avoid underlining the need for adequate financing for the CAP. This House cannot accept a rural development funding cut.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have succeeded in seeing our main concerns included in this report. They include the need to maintain an adequately funded common agricultural policy for the Union. I must stress that we shall not agree to the withdrawal of any financial resources in order to guarantee the enforcement of the CAP. We want a fairer distribution of aid both among Member States and among farmers, through the introduction of a new system not linked to production but based on environmental and social criteria; that is to say, one that promotes employment. We must also orient the CAP towards real farmers and create a specific mechanism for small farmers.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Dess for his excellent work. I would like to talk about one aspect of agricultural policy. That is the enormous challenges that humanity and the whole world are facing. These include the climate, biodiversity and the eutrophication of waterways. There are all sorts of examples I could give here. In this context, I think that we need to realise that it is farmers who manage our environment and the prerequisites for our lives and our futures on a day-to-day basis. It is in agriculture and forestry that we have the best tools and it is for the use of these environmental tools that farmers should be paid, and they should be paid well for this. I would therefore like us in future to change our thinking somewhat and move away from income subsidies, which are difficult to account for, and ensure that we pay for the job that farmers do. In other words, we should stop paying subsidies and start paying for the services provided. The most important task for agriculture is, of course, to produce food – sufficient, good-quality food – but my view is that food should be paid for on the market. Environmental services cannot be paid for there.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in many respects the Dess report is very good, but in one respect it is quite the opposite, since it rejects the idea of a fair equalisation of direct payments. The bizarre and absurd principle whereby more assistance is given to those who are richer and less to those who are poorer is to continue to hold sway in the agricultural sector. The farmers in the new Member States, and not only the farmers, are extremely worried and alarmed by these developments. The agricultural sector is in decline, particularly in the new Member States. I would ask you to look at how much land is lying fallow in Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would call on my fellow Members from the old Member States to end this discrimination. Let us finally equalise direct payments fairly, and let us not create a two-speed Europe. I should like to address the French Members of the House in particular to remind them of the slogan of ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ which adorned the banners of the French revolution. We have liberty, but we do not have equality, and without equality there can be no fraternity. Let us demand equality.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I think that this report marks a huge step forward. It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational. However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus. This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament’s great strength. We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members. The first phase is complete.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions. I think that is important. We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity. In my opinion, this was another fundamental point. The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts. We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations. This is not a question of ideology.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats. We need to come up with unequivocal responses. What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate. Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going. That is essentially what we are waiting for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany’s attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe’s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount. That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget. I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, a great job has been done, but the completed report is couched in very general terms. The report clearly outlines a new direction – agricultural greening. This could be a form of lifebelt for non-productive farmers, who could avoid having to engage in agricultural production and yet receive area payments. In my view, we should, when applying this report in practice, bear in mind what is missing. The protein problem is missing, the issue of the quality of imported food has not been incorporated, there is no mention of the problem of genetically modified crops, and land degradation issues have been insufficiently addressed. There is still no clear definition of such terms as ‘active farmer’, ‘new farmer’, ‘fair area payments’, and ‘family farms’. Unfortunately, a great many farmers will find no answers to their problems and their questions in this report. In the future we must improve it.</p>

Had this policy been enforced this year, it would have resulted in total crop failures. Proper inspection and enforcement of greening measures will also be impossible.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be effective, the capping of single farm payments will need to be severe. This will immediately motivate farmers to formally split their businesses with their spouses so that the full payment is retained on both divisions. Added to that, I am informed that the savings made from capping will accrue to the EU and not the Member State that actually generated the savings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cultivation of GM crops should be the decision of individual Member States. The suggestion that no single farm payment can be received by farmers who cultivate these crops is utterly nonsensical. The world is short of food.

      <p sl="es">Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget.</p>

      <p sl="es">I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond – just to give another example – to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well.</p>
      <p sl="es">The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear – today of all days – that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector. This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework.</p>

      <p sl="de">Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go. Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market? Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future? That is the course we are currently setting. To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies. If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years. It is too much of a strain on our farmers’ finances. Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner. We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly. We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well. The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe. After all, Europe is not alone in the world.</p>

I very much welcome this development. I hope that no new discriminatory conditions will be imposed on farmers in the new programming period. Unfortunately, I have to say that the Dess report contains such a proposal. I am thinking primarily of support for the so-called capping of direct payments for larger agricultural undertakings. I regard such a course of action as discriminatory against Member States such as the Czech Republic, which, for historical reasons, have larger farms than elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I therefore reject the idea of capping direct payments, since this is a move which will reduce the efficiency of agriculture throughout the European Union.

      <p sl="en">I particularly like the idea of the continuation of direct payments and the explicit removal of the historical reference values in paragraph 15 and the fairer distribution between Member States, and within Member States in the regions and nations within them, in paragraph 16.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming from Scotland, I am particularly glad to see a strong statement in favour of less favoured areas in paragraph 82. I know that farmers in Scotland – and everywhere else too – will be glad to see paragraph 44, which contains an explicit statement that cross-compliance should be risk-based and proportional. Commissioner, perhaps you could mention that paragraph in particular to some of your auditor colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="en">While there is much to admire in this report, let us be honest with ourselves and with our voters. Unless we have paragraph 1, all of this is pointless – and paragraph 1, where we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with the ambitious objectives, will be pointless too. Like other colleagues, I wish to express my own concern, not least at today’s rumours that President Barroso is looking to make swingeing cuts to the budget and Pillar Two in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you are going to need all the allies you can get in these discussions within the Commission and with the Member States. We must have a CAP that is properly funded and properly ambitious for our farmers and our citizens. European agriculture has a great story to tell. Now is not the time to fall out over minutiae.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe’s policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned. The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we obviously need a strong CAP. The agricultural sector provides clear added value to the European economy. It plays a multifunctional role, by contributing to the production of public goods for the benefit of society as a whole. The CAP budget must, at the very least, stay at current levels and similar resources and objectives must be safeguarded for the new CAP.</p>
      <p sl="el">The distribution of CAP resources between farmers in the European Union, which is at the top of the public dialogue agenda, requires care. The idea of a flat rate throughout the European Union is broadly opposed. In my opinion, we need objective criteria that take due account of the peculiarities of the agricultural sector in the individual EU Member States. The proposals to cap direct payments, pay special aid to small-scale farmers and only to pay aid to active farmers are a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="el">Agro-environmental measures should be easy to apply, should be flanked by adequate counterbalances and should not create any additional administrative burden. With widespread instability on agricultural markets, climate risks and a food crisis, we need to activate effective instruments. The current market measures need to be reinforced. We also need a permanent crisis management fund. The proposal for a new farm income stabilisation instrument is a good idea. Finally, I would highlight the need for effective measures for the benefit of young farmers.</p>
      <p sl="el">My thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Albert Dess, for a difficult and complicated job well done. Commissioner, any weakening of the CAP will come up against political opposition from the European Parliament. I think that this is the cross-party message of this House and serious account needs to be taken of it.</p>

We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy. We want greening and we want it in the first pillar. Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital. We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream. The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe.

In my view, these proposals will need a reality check when the overall EU budget is determined some time next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to get back to the real priorities of the common agricultural policy. Food security, food safety, biodiversity, climate change, new technologies and creating a viable, competitive market-led industry have to be the focus.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, the Commission’s proposals have lost the direction which we had from the previous two reports. They lack focus and they are too complicated.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the report by Mr Dess is about giving consideration to protection of the environment and the climate in agriculture, as well as increasing the competitiveness of agriculture. We have negotiated good compromises on these points. I feel that we should speak out in favour of well thought through upper ceilings for farms, particularly when the recipients are multinational groups which sometimes receive sums that simply cannot be justified.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is firmly on the side of farmers when it comes to removing bureaucracy. The complete reorganisation of the systems and the associated introduction of additional checks, as called for by others, would make no sense whatsoever. We need to be quite clear about one thing: if consumers expect European agriculture to move further towards greening and sustainability, then the measures concerned have to be given the necessary financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am firmly opposed to cuts in the EU agricultural budget in the forthcoming budget period. As regards the press reports stating that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, wants to take an axe to rural development, I would state quite clearly that if the Commission cuts the programmes for rural development then it will be cutting off the lifeblood of rural areas. Well-functioning farming structures would be dramatically affected by cuts in the second pillar. Mr Barroso would be well advised to heed what this House is saying.</p>
      <p sl="de">The common agricultural policy is and remains a key area of Community policy and of the EU budget. We cannot impose additional constraints on our farms, which are facing increasing global competition, and at the same time reduce their support. On the contrary, investment subsidies under the second pillar will promote a keenness and a willingness for innovation. That will benefit everyone in rural areas. We must particularly implement measures in respect of young farmers, in order to secure the future of agriculture. Our future agricultural policy will decide whether or not Europe is self-sufficient in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">With 42% of our European expenditure going on the CAP, it is vital that we provide complete accountability to our citizens. Most people, in the face of rising food prices – sharply rising food prices – and dire warnings about lack of supply, will be expecting to see a CAP which focuses clearly on increasing productivity and efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we have to take care of the environment – I am a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we know that – but we are in real danger here of creating a report with a rhetoric moving into things like ‘greening Pillar One’; we are talking about moving away from the real focus, which is efficiency. On that basis, I do not support the capping of payments to large farms. This move will be institutionalising inefficiency and there is no justification for it.</p>

I am sure it was not easy, but we have achieved good compromises.</p>
      <p sl="de">We stand for competitive and sustainable agriculture in Europe. That means that our farmers produce food of the highest quality. However, we are also producing a cultural landscape that can be seen, that provides recreational spaces for you all, for all of us, for our society, that provides jobs not just in agriculture but also in tourism and in many other areas. That is a service that agriculture provides for society, but this is respected far too little by society – and sometimes also by us. It is an extensive service, and such an extensive service does not deserve to have the agricultural budget cut if it is at all possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, we support you in your approach of bringing more ecology and more greening into the first pillar. However, this must not result in those countries and those farmers which already have very ambitious environmental programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by this new approach. A solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides.</p>
      <p sl="de">Environmental programmes are expensive. When I read in the newspapers – as has been mentioned already by many Members – that cuts are to be made in the second pillar, I reject it vehemently. We need a strong first pillar. We also need – and have spoken out in favour of this – a strong second pillar. We will support you, Commissioner, in these efforts.</p>

It is important to keep the two-pillar structure, to maintain direct payments and especially the strong rural development policy, and to improve competitiveness and strengthen environmental awareness. Innovation, research and development are of key importance as well. Environmental public goods and technologies that reduce the effects of climate change and enhance biodiversity and water management should be the focus of rural development. Further financial assistance is needed in the future as well to help new Member States close the gap and ensure that they can access rural development aid with better co-financing conditions post-2013, as well. It is important to provide equal competitive conditions and equal opportunities for the new Member States from 2014.

We are also pleased to have worked together with other groups and the rapporteur to produce an ambitious compromise.</p>

Paragraph 16 blatantly contradicts the fundamental principle of equal conditions for competition on the single market. On the one hand there is a proposal to move away from the historical reference values, and yet on the other hand there is a proposal to sanction huge differences in direct support for farmers from the individual Member States. Some would be given EUR 200-250 per hectare, others EUR 350 or over EUR 400, and we are not just talking about a division into old and new Member States, since farmers from Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, Finland and Sweden would also receive the lower rates.

      <p sl="es">To achieve this, we need ambitious policies in the areas of direct payments, market management – including up-to-date intervention prices – and rural development, thus adapting the CAP to the new reality. Indeed, the new CAP must be adapted to the 2020 strategy, but this must not entail cuts of even EUR 1, because there is no surfeit of resources for all the environmental, social and health challenges we intend to take on.</p>

Sometimes, quite rightly, we focus on improving conditions for current workers, but disregard in public debate what we need to do to bring new workers into agriculture so that our production will be assured and improved, in view of the fact that the countries that have lent most support to young farmers are least exposed to land abandonment.

The report calls for direct payments to be capped and to be restricted to active farmers, precisely so that the recipients are those who actually cultivate the land, not speculators.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Nor do I want the question of food, which remains the primary and essential purpose of the common agricultural policy, to be pitted against environmental concerns – and the Commission communication does not pit them against each other, in fact. What we are proposing is balanced support for a range of agricultural practices. This will ensure a balance between the aim of being financially competitive and the desire to maintain and conserve our natural resources’ regenerative capacities. In fact, I do not see how agriculture could be competitive in the medium and long term without careful management of natural resources. That is why we want to find a balance within the CAP, rather than pitting food concerns against environmental issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there is the question of a more targeted common agricultural policy. Mr Ashworth raised this point, although I see that he is no longer here. The Commission is proposing more targeted direct payments. Here again, I consider that the proposals made in Mr Dess’s report are very much in line with what the Commission plans to include in its legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will propose measures that will allow us to deal with crises, be they market crises, health crises or crises related to extreme weather. That is the kind of instruments that we will be proposing. I would also like to thank Parliament for supporting us in this key aim, which will provide reassurance to farmers in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having made these additional comments, let me conclude by reiterating my confidence about tomorrow’s vote and in the quality of the Dess report. I can promise you that in October, when the Commission presents its legislative proposals, you will recognise all the key elements. I would like to thank you once again for this work, which has brought real added value to the legislative package that the Commission will be tabling.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here. Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation. European agriculture is a positive factor. It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world. I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar. In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals – in other words, his own goals. When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak?</p>
      <p sl="de">Here I should like to emphasise – as has been mentioned a couple of times today already – that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did. Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations? I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today. My report therefore had a substantial buffer.</p>
      <p sl="de">The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future. Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have. We are able to offer you that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">With regard to milk quotas, we have to check whether or not it is in fact a good idea to continue to implement a decision made eight years ago, on the basis of forecasts.

      <p sl="ro">We are all aware of the potential and crucial role the common agricultural policy has in achieving environmental and climate targets, in providing public goods and also in attaining the EU’s food security targets. However, it is extremely important that, when we talk about agriculture and the future of the CAP, ‘simplification’ and ‘innovation’ are the watchwords. We must focus on those policy measures which do not impose new administrative burdens because we do not want to make our farmers’ lives even harder. The common agricultural policy must become fairer and simpler. I believe that we need to find a fair balance between the policy objectives we are proposing and the administrative burden. We need to safeguard farmers’ welfare and strengthen local economies. We have to protect the environment and also be concerned about producing high-quality, safe and healthy food. When it comes to agriculture, we must not focus exclusively on technological solutions or on discussions about technological solutions. We also have to take into account consumption patterns, the issue of waste and the complex relationship between the environment, biodiversity and health.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. The final document sends a clear message to the Commission, which is currently in the middle of its internal budget discussion on the next financial programme: namely that Parliament sees the future common agricultural policy as one that is capable of delivering for the European economy in terms of employment and growth. It is a policy that will deal with the challenges of food security; it is a policy that will deliver public goods, protect the environment and enhance biodiversity; and it is a vehicle for tackling climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Reducing European farmers’ capacity and hampering their competitiveness and viability with a weak CAP budget would be counterproductive and short-sighted. This is a sector with a wealth of potential for expansion, for growth in the economy, for research and innovation and for tackling climate change. The CAP produces measurable results and a clear return on investment with regard to the delivery of public goods. The CAP post-2014, as outlined in this report, has clear aims and priorities, on which European farmers can and will deliver – but they need the support of a credible budget behind them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the report drafted by Mr Dess is vital in the context of the global food crisis and current environmental risks. The new version of the common agricultural policy includes values such as consumer protection and regional cohesion. I think that long-term productivity depends, to a large extent, on the sustainable management of natural resources, which is another objective on the agenda. I welcome the initiative promoting more active involvement by farmers in rural development programmes, which will help boost local competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy. Cooperation between Member States is essential, as demonstrated during the E. coli crisis this summer. In order to avoid food price fluctuations, I support the adoption of additional risk-prevention measures available to all EU farmers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, I think that it is important for agricultural funds to be distributed fairly. On this point, I should stress, for example, the impact of direct aid on boosting small farms’ profitability and competitiveness.</p>

As such, I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP; to supporting small- and medium-sized food producers; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture. Given that the Commission is broadly in agreement with the Parliament’s proposals, I call on this House to make their voice heard in ensuring that the European Council also supports this report’s environmental proposals.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The common agricultural policy is faced with a number of challenges calling for the European Union and Member States to make a strategic decision about the future of agriculture. To be able to tackle these challenges effectively, the CAP must operate in an environment of sound economic policies and sustainable public funding which will help the Union achieve its EU 2020 strategy objectives. I think that the European Union also needs to have in the future adequate instruments for tackling the crises affecting the market and food supply, as well as the fluctuations in the prices and market in the agricultural sector. I think that CAP funds need to be shared fairly for the first and second pillars, both among Member States and among farmers within a Member State. This will tangibly reduce the great disparities in how these funds are shared among Member States. The CAP’s second pillar is of paramount importance for rural development. I think that particular attention should be focused on motivating and encouraging young farmers. Consequently, I am in favour of introducing in this pillar targeted measures which will be defined by Member States, with the aim of achieving the EU’s priority targets so that compensation payments are maintained for the disadvantaged areas in the second pillar.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Agriculture is without a doubt the economic sector in which the European Union has achieved the most. The current debate takes place against the backdrop of the Commission’s plans to unveil vital proposals for reform in October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This House has reached a compromise in the report under discussion. We have retained two strong pillars: the first pillar, direct aid, needs adequate funding that reflects the challenges facing agriculture, which means at least maintaining current financing levels. However, it will also be brought more into line with the second pillar, support for sustainable development. I believe that the greening of the first pillar needs to be judged correctly, so that it does not add to the environmental requirements with which farmers are already seriously burdened. After all, their primary role is to produce food. The report also reaches out to young farmers who, as we know, struggle to get started in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, clearly these objectives can only be achieved if the Union’s budget is not cut. What is the point of having ambitious aims if we do not have the means to realise them?</p>

      <p sl="de">We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards. In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society. That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning. By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise. The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it.

      <p sl="pt">This report proposes the continuity of the common agricultural policy (CAP), though with some contradictions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore take a critical stance, and we have put forward alternative proposals that respond effectively both to the need for agricultural production to ensure food sovereignty and food security in every country, and to the problems of family farming and rural development. These proposals all take into account the social importance of the land and of the people who work it, the specific characteristics of each country and social justice in the distribution of grants, both among Member States and among crops and farmers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we have put forward this set of proposals, in which in particular we clearly and unequivocally advocate the system of production quotas adapted to each Member State according to its food requirements, thus ensuring that farmers in countries such as Portugal are protected.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Europe will need a strong agriculture even after 2013, because the principal means of guaranteeing European citizens’ food security is European agriculture. Food production has to remain the primary aim of agriculture, because the world population continues to grow and is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2045. However, we need a strong common agricultural policy and strong agricultural assistance to achieve this goal. I therefore consider it important that pursuant to the report, the agricultural budget be maintained at least at the same level as in 2013 in the next EU financing period. This March, the Hungarian Presidency adopted presidential conclusions serving the interests of European farmers. The excessive price volatility in the previous period is partly the consequence of wrong decisions taken by the EU, for instance the abolition of maize intervention. Thus, we need an agricultural policy which ensures efficient action against extreme price volatility and speculation. The milk crisis made it clear that measures to restrict production are needed in the milk sector. In Member States where there was a higher-than-average decrease in sugar production as a result of the sugar reform, production must be allowed to increase.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is imperative that the CAP is adequately equipped to rise to the challenges it will have to face in the future. The CAP cannot be monolithic; it should be implemented with flexibility and within the current economic and political context. A regulatory policy-based framework should be developed with long-term goals in mind. This would afford small farmers greater stability and would enable them to draw up investment plans over a broader time horizon without concern for the disruption that could be caused by short-term quick-fix policies and give them the support they need to safeguard their business. The agriculture sector’s susceptibility to market instability and price volatility must be addressed and the CAP should guarantee a safety-mechanism and provision for effective risk prevention, which would give farmers a measure of income security in these economically trying times and serve to provide foresight of how global price volatility will affect developing countries. The global climatic challenges, the strain posed by demographic changes on food security, as well as the economic recession, should lead to the intensification of efforts to ensure sustainable growth, encourage and protect jobs. Dedicated innovation and research will support Europe’s transition to becoming more environmentally and economically sustainable.</p>

It is important that we maintain support for disadvantaged regions and the opportunity for production-related payments in the regions where there is no alternative to a particular production type. I am pleased to note that my request for greater flexibility within the second pillar was also heeded. The situation in agricultural sectors differs in the various Member States. Greater freedom in defining countries’ priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop.

Just how important the latter is has been made clear to us once again by the recent enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) crisis. Consumers make great demands of organic produce. They expect organic produce to provide ecological balance, which in reality is often more than questionable. Rather than having an especially positive impact on sustainability, the prudent use of resources, CO2 savings and the protection of livestock, organic produce is often transported right across Europe. The EU needs to act here – and I speak as a representative of Austria, the leading country in organic farming. Greater importance must be attached to regional provision and seasonal availability, as well as strict labelling of the origin of foods. Services provided by agriculture must therefore be recompensed by fair product prices. Let us not use the common agricultural policy to promote agro-industry; let us promote our farmers instead.</p>

The answer to the global problems of agriculture will not be found by increasing production in Europe, but is part of a broader equation, in which economic, social and environmental issues are taken into account. Instead of a narrow-minded agricultural policy, we need a food policy that considers the whole food production chain, from start to finish.

I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which is clearly the work of an author who understands the issues involved. I am all the more alarmed by the attempt to establish new discriminatory conditions. The capping of direct payments is a new form of discrimination against Member States in which, for historical reasons, most of the agricultural undertakings manage larger areas of land. These agricultural undertakings comply with the same rules and provide the same services as small undertakings in other countries, and they fulfil the conditions for direct payments equally well. The discrimination against large undertakings resulting from capping may put jobs in rural areas at risk, and stifle innovative potential. If we want to talk credibly about a single market, can we really countenance discrimination against certain Member States in the form of differences in payments per hectare or capping?</p>
      <p sl="cs">Farmers from the 12 new Member States have now reached the end of a difficult 10-year period, which they agreed to on the understanding that it was a transitional period which would not be extended.

Indeed, I consider that many paragraphs contain information that I and some of my colleagues sought to include. I refer to the important statements that promote our southern agriculture. For example, direct aid will no longer simply be based on a premium per hectare, but the size of the farm, employment arrangements, labour productivity and legal form will also be taken into consideration at long last. I am also very pleased that these payments will only be awarded to farmers who are truly active in the sector, so that the aid goes to those who genuinely need it and who use it to benefit agriculture. Provision has also been made to distribute aid more evenly, bearing in mind that, for historical reasons, farms in the European Union have very diverse structures. I fully support the paragraph calling for the new CAP to be equipped with the instruments necessary to limit price volatility.

This means maintaining an ambitious common agricultural policy that can satisfy our most basic long-term need: food. The CAP does, however, need to be tweaked to make it fairer. European citizens would not understand if the bulk of assistance were to go to large agricultural operators: small farmers too must be able to make a living from what they produce, work in decent conditions and be paid fairly. When allocating aid, we must also give more thought to natural constraints, such as global warming, mountain areas and scarce water supplies. The current drought demonstrates that the CAP urgently needs to include practical resources that will allow our farmers to deal with water shortages. I would therefore appeal for a subtle shift in the CAP to make it more relevant and able to guarantee our food self-sufficiency, the vitality of our agricultural sector and the preservation of our rural areas.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the component of the economic governance package that deals with the Stability and Growth Pact is not the response that Europe requires at this time of structural crisis. The package does indeed revisit the Stability and Growth Pact, but not to change its essence. It revisits it to make its demands broader and its penalties tougher.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It would seem more useful to assume that the pact is impossible to comply with if a country’s economy is not growing and, in particular, if there is a crisis. These issues should be at the heart of the political agenda. We should discuss having a crisis management policy and its associated instruments in euro area countries and, on another matter, how to prevent the persistently divergent evolution of the euro economies from destroying the single currency. If these issues are not resolved, the pact becomes stupid, as someone said. There is, however, a glimmer of hope in the package: the new initiative to identify and correct the macroeconomic imbalances that build up, particularly in the eurozone, before they become insoluble problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament wanted responsibilities as co-legislator and has carried them out to the full. The text on which we are going to vote reflects a broad consensus, which was only possible thanks to everyone’s huge capacity for work and spirit of compromise. As rapporteur, I wish to thank all my fellow Members from all political groups, particularly my shadow rapporteurs, and I pick out Mr Haglund especially, for whom I acted as shadow rapporteur as well.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The trialogue phase was long and hard, and the agreement we reached – sadly not a full one – was due to the Hungarian Presidency, represented by Minister Kármán, the Commission, represented by Commissioner Rehn, and all our partners. Let us speak plainly: identifying macroeconomic imbalances is a complex and completely novel process. Rather than merely applying sanctions, it is important to identify the risks competently, find out whether they are the country’s responsibility or whether they result from external impacts, and make correct, timely and practicable recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">After the negotiating process, the scoreboard – that is, the set of indicators that have been negotiated – includes not only financial and nominal indicators, but also indicators from the real economy. We also trust that the Commission will scrupulously respect the compromise of recital 6-A, which involves Parliament alongside the Council in future review processes. Interpretation will also not be done automatically, but intelligently through in-depth reviews, which are demanding for the Commission but necessary.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission’s recommendations will have to ensure consistency with all the other strategic documents, but the country will bear the main responsibility for proposing solutions to implement. Parliament’s enhanced powers, the greater involvement of the social partners and respect for collective bargaining practices have all been guaranteed. Penalties are justified in cases of lack of cooperation but not where countries are unable to meet the targets. They are also graded, which is an important aspect. We would have preferred to lighten the penalties, but we had to agree to them as part of the compromises.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Before agreement can be reached, there is one fundamental stumbling block: the recognition that in an internal market, in a monetary area, it makes sense that the variations in the scoreboard indicators should be observed whether they are positive or negative, and that both deficits and surpluses should be subject to observation, even though they obviously do not give rise to similar recommendations. All of us – individual Members, political groups and institutions – have come a long way. Agreement on a balanced, high-quality text is in sight. I just hope that the spirit of compromise that has brought us this far will carry us through to a final agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this is a further stage in an exceptional piece of work that we have been doing in the European Parliament. At this point I must warmly acknowledge Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Goulard, Mr Haglund, Mrs Ferreira and Mrs Ford, who have been rapporteurs with me throughout this economic governance package. I must also offer a very special word of thanks to the various shadow rapporteurs who have helped us in our work. Lastly, I must emphasise the exceptional work carried out by the Council on this issue, especially by András Kármán, who worked closely with us, and Commissioner Rehn, who also played an invaluable part in the whole process.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My first word is one of confidence, in a positive vein. This economic governance package must show that Europe is capable: it is capable of overcoming difficulties and it is capable of guarding against future problems. That is why I am highly confident about what is going to happen with this economic governance legislation in the coming days. In the Stability and Growth Pact, for which I was rapporteur for the corrective part, it is possible to add the idea of growth to that of stability and budgetary discipline. It is possible to innovate with the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. It is possible to go beyond an approach of merely having a penalty mechanism, and that is why adoption of this economic governance package will lead to more Europe and better Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In relation to the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact, for example, this economic governance package has brought us a more intelligent application of the pact, through the attention it devotes to the debt criterion; the introduction of an average rate for debt reduction, to be carried out over three years, allowing for flexibility in fulfilling the rules; a more detailed and appropriate list of relevant factors that the Commission should take into account in its assessment of the financial situation of the countries involved; and the introduction of a three-year transition period for implementation of the debt criterion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are also other aspects that I want to highlight here, which concern other reports. Because we worked in conjunction all the time, I must mention the important introduction of a European semester regime in the preventive part, and point out that the preventive part is essential and that penalties should only be applied as the final step in this whole procedure. The procedure includes the introduction of symmetry in the analysis of macroeconomic indicators, the possibility that the Commission will produce a study on Eurobonds by the end of this year, an integrated vision of penalties as a final step in relation both to macroeconomic imbalances and to the Stability and Growth Pact, and the question of introducing reverse qualified majority voting for Council decisions. All these steps have been taken as essential parts of Parliament’s role.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we can send our citizens a very clear message right now. The message is that we are preparing an institutional mechanism to prevent future crises. Europe will be much better prepared with this economic governance package. Europe is taking a crucial step with this economic governance package so that our economy can grow soundly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Council. We can all see the incredibly sensitive situation in Europe and especially in the eurozone which has required different countries to work together in a way that has never been seen before. We can see the vital need to improve competitiveness and rebuild public finances in a sustainable manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over recent days, weeks and months, we have constantly seen ministers from Member States coming together to try to help find ways out of each other’s individual problems. In addition, never before have I seen such a desire from members of the public to understand where public money is spent. So let me first talk about the directive that I have worked on.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive sets out a series of requirements in accounting statistics, forecasting and budgetary processes. Let us not forget that inadequate budget planning and inaccurate information compounded this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a Council directive, not a co-legislative report, and the Council has debated this extensively. Member States themselves have agreed that they will adopt fiscal planning horizons of at least three years to include all levels of government and government funds in their budget processes and ensure that information on, for example, contingent liabilities is disclosed. Accounting and forecasting performance will be independently evaluated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say that many of the Member States already comply with large parts of this directive, but implementing this minimum series of requirements will introduce discipline and restore confidence, and is a first small step back on the path to stability in public finances.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, Member States themselves have agreed that they will each introduce their own legislation on fiscal rules – not necessarily German constitution debt breaks – but rules tailor-made in each country to keep them in line with their obligations under the Treaty. Now this is sensitive as well because different countries have different obligations under the Treaty and for that reason that section does not apply to the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the negotiations on the wider ‘six pack’ a number of suggestions for improving this Council directive were made, many by the European Central Bank and by Members of this House. The Council has worked in good faith to try and improve the directive where appropriate and improve transparency, but without stepping on the sensitive issues relating to individual national constitutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Briefly on the other directives. Through these negotiations I have tried to be constructive in allowing euro zone Member States in particular to set up what rules and sanctions they see necessary to underpin their stability. I have not supported colleagues who think the solution is just a stronger role for the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the weekend and on Monday night, the Council tried to offer a final compromise on an outstanding issue of votes in the European Council. Whilst this is not, in my opinion, a deeply significant issue in my own Member State – as we do not intend to join the euro and resulting fines do not apply to us – it is an extremely difficult and contentious issue in many countries, including those who intend to join.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a time to try to understand each other’s problems but also respect each other’s differences. Earlier this week I warned colleagues that heading into a direct confrontation between Parliament and the Council on an issue that I did not believe I could explain to any man on the street would not be a responsible position of this Parliament. Indeed, I said I thought it would be irresponsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">And this Parliament’s approach on that issue is not supported by many of my group’s members. I cannot support Parliament’s changes to the Council text on the macroeconomic imbalances and I would like to see in the weeks ahead more clarity on the different positions between euro zone and non-euro-zone Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="3-168-000" speaker_id="97137" name="Sylvie Goulard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have had countless trialogue meetings, some late at night, with other Members, the Commission and the Hungarian Presidency. I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members and our counterparts for the work that we have completed together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The message from the Ecofin Council is that everyone needs to shoulder their responsibilities. My immediate reaction is to say: ‘All right, then, let us genuinely face up to our responsibilities.’ Not with a huge fanfare, not so as to be able to say that we reached an agreement rapidly, but with an eye on the financial problems in the euro area and the European Union and in an attempt to come up with some proper solutions. Certainly, that was my group’s motto in these negotiations. I doubt that the markets and our citizens would believe in speedy but superficial solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In our estimation, substantial improvements are needed. We have, I think, already achieved some of the objectives that we set ourselves. Let me remind you that we are not the only ones with these aims: on several occasions, the European Central Bank has called on Parliament to beef up the Commission’s already bold proposals. We have therefore firmed up the rules. That was one of our guiding principles: not for the pleasure of rule-making, but because breaking common rules in a community based on the rule of law endangers the single currency. We have introduced penalties for fraud. Unfortunately this is one of the lessons that we have had to learn from the euro’s early years. As Mrs Ford said, we have also tried to impose a degree of order on national budgetary procedures, if only so as to be able to compare practices in different countries. One point was particularly important to me: if we go to our citizens with nothing to say other than ‘we have increased automaticity’, as the newspapers are putting it, they will be left with the impression that some mysterious machine has been turned on in Brussels and will rap them on the knuckles whenever something goes wrong.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want stricter rules, they need to be more intelligent, but above all we need more democratic debate and more cross-border discussions. This is why we have proposed – and I would like to thank all the Members who have supported me on this point – creating what we have termed an economic dialogue, which must be proportionate. There is no threat to national constitutions; it is simply an expression of our desire for more discussion within the euro area in particular, but also in the Europe of 27. We want this House to be the forum for that transparent dialogue between the European institutions and the Member States, and in particular a place where Member States can voice their problems and explain their positions. Some countries are lagging behind, others are further ahead, some are on the fringes, some have larger populations: we need to bear all that in mind. I am delighted to see that this week in the German media Mr Habermas has again stressed that increasing democratic legitimacy is a vital necessity. I would say to Mrs Ford that we are not arguing in favour of enhancing our powers, we are calling for a greater role for those mandated by the people to defend their interests in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are other important points, particularly on the macroeconomic side. I believe that all Member States need to be subject to common surveillance. Symmetry is an important issue. The Council should understand what this means: intelligent symmetry that distinguishes between deficit and surplus, but symmetry all the same.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me close by mentioning Eurosecurities, which were one of the things that I championed. I would like to make an appeal to all political group leaders: you cannot claim to support Eurosecurities but vote against them. You might argue that you want more, I myself would have liked to go further, but I do fully appreciate the efforts that Commissioner Rehn is willing to make. Let me remind you that the Commissioner himself put forward proposals in May 2010 in accordance with the Commission’s legislative initiative. We want to put those proposals back on track.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want the euro finally to take on the mantle of a world currency, we want a large and liquid market, which will reduce the cost of borrowing. We want part of that borrowing – a limited amount, of course – to be shared in the long term using a full-blown market regulatory instrument. Consequently, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be favourable and that all those who claim to be in favour of Eurosecurities will discuss the issue in a spirit of open-mindedness rather than based on ideological prejudices.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, if one thing is clear, it is that Europe needs a solid foundation in order to prevent a new euro crisis in the future and to ensure sustainable economic growth. Our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is satisfied with the results we have achieved so far in the legislative package on economic governance. I would like to extend my warm thanks to all the Members, rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs, employees, staff and everyone for the many hours we have spent together in order to achieve this because, in exercising its powers, the European Parliament has taken a firm and ambitious position. I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency, and in particular András Kámán, for the efforts put in to bridging the differences between the Council and Parliament. Indeed, you personally have made it possible for us to reach a 98% agreement, partly thanks to the helpful support of Commissioner Rehn and his staff. This is an excellent result, but it was not an easy one to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Tomorrow, we will be voting on the reports. My group is strongly committed to building on the high level of agreement that we have reached. I hope that we will be able to bridge the last differences over the next few weeks so that we can finalise an agreement before the summer. This is very important, because my group is striving for a final vote in the plenary in July.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The turmoil in the financial markets continues and we urgently need to find a solution to the debt crisis in several countries. However, it is just as urgent – and therein now lies our task as co-legislator – that Europe demonstrates strong decision making in terms of an ambitious stability pact and economic governance. Reaching a decision before the summer is crucial to restoring confidence in the euro, given that the Stability and Growth Pact was being broken as early as 2003. Instead of the rules being enforced, they were simply liberalised and we now need to put a stop to that. This is about credible legislation, not behind-the-scenes negotiations between Member States aimed at avoiding penalties. If Member States fail to take effective action in order to meet their commitments and reduce their deficits – and these are commitments, remember, that they have undertaken of their own free will – then decision-making must be effective. That is why this House has proposed the reverse voting procedure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let us face it, the magic formula of our fellow Members on the left, the golden rule, will not deliver the solution. Unfortunately, money does not grow on trees and the days of easy solutions and painless choices are now behind us. That is why the PPE Group is calling for sustainable public finances and for 5 or 6% budget deficits not to be permitted. A debt burden – the painful evidence of which we are witnessing – stands in the way of economic growth, not only in our European countries, but also in the United States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need a solid foundation, and that is why I am pleased that the Council will exercise the preventive arm of the proposals, namely to ensure that Member States strengthen their own national responsibilities and involve their national parliaments in the process, clear deadlines, procedures and inspection visits, more public reports, peer pressure and public debates in this House rather than in the confines of the Council. Obviously, the European semester is an important achievement, because we want jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are facing an important and historic day. Tomorrow, in the House, we will stand ready to shoulder our responsibilities. I see that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to put a spanner in the works. It seems that they only want to work in a spirit of compromise when it comes to their own reports. Mr President, that is no spirit of compromise. I would like to call on all Members who consider sustainable public finances important to support these six reports tomorrow. They are not the final outcome, because tomorrow we will be taking a step towards consulting with the Council on how we can clear these last hurdles on our way to – what will hopefully be – an agreement in July.</p>

    <intervention id="3-170-000" speaker_id="96683" name="Carl Haglund" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I believe that the events that we have been able to follow this week, both in the Council and in those countries that are wrestling with very serious economic problems, once again show us why the package we are now debating is so important. If we do not manage to make headway on these matters, the problems are more likely to continue rather than be resolved. I also believe that it is important to remember what happened in 2005 when we ought to have taken action and demonstrated that it is not all right to contravene the common allocation clauses. We did not do that; instead we changed the rules. Now it is time to rectify this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This package is important. I would like to say a big thank you to my fellow Members. We worked hard together. As has been said many times, we are very close to achieving the goal, but at the same time it is important that we are successful in the voting today and in July. I would also like to thank Mr Kármán from the Hungarian Presidency, who has done a splendid job. We really appreciate what he has done. As I said, I would also like to thank my fellow Members, and Mrs Ferreira in particular. We have done an excellent job in creating a macroeconomic surveillance procedure, which is something new and which complements the work that is done to keep the common currency afloat. That is something that Europe needs.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Going back to 2005, the European Parliament is still demanding that we find a solution with regard to what we refer to as reversed qualified majority voting. Why is that? It is because we have found that if we do not have an adequate automatic decision-making system in the Council, the necessary decisions do not get taken. We cannot afford for this to happen any longer. In this regard, we still have an unresolved issue, but I hope that the Council will manage to hold a serious discussion on what this is actually about. The European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday. It must not be the case that, for reasons of prestige, no decision is taken on something that everyone knows is necessary. Nor must it be the case that certain larger Member States think that they can agree in advance on certain matters, so making it a ‘done deal’. The Council must take genuine decisions and the legislation must be decided on in consultation with the European Parliament. The Council now has the opportunity to take wise decisions, and I am sure that the European Parliament can help it to take the right ones.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With regard to the macroeconomic element, I would firstly like to emphasise that, thanks to the work that we have done in Parliament, we have a proposal that we have agreed on with the Council and one that is sufficiently transparent and also contains a solution that is sufficiently automatic. I believe that this solution means that we will also be able to feel secure in future with regard to the euro area and to the possibility of remedying the sorts of economic problems in an individual country that could otherwise result in the whole of the euro area being put at risk. I think it is good that, in our report, we establish a system for dealing with countries that fail to fulfil their commitments, in other words a requirement for the problems to be remedied directly. The first time a promise is broken, the country will be forced to pay an interest-bearing deposit, as we have called it. This is necessary. We cannot send out a signal to the effect that if a country promises to do something in particular, but then fails to do it there will be no consequences. Unfortunately, that is what the original proposal was like. I am pleased that we were able to rectify that. This is an important matter of principle. At the same time, we have also got to grips with the problem of fraud, where other countries are deceived. This is also extremely important. I think that the European Parliament has done a good job in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As several speakers have said, tomorrow’s vote is a very important one, and I believe that it will go well. I hope that, at the end of this week and through the following week, the European Council will be able to have a serious discussion about what we can do to reach an agreement. That is something that we will also do in Parliament. Then we can have the legislation that Europe so badly needs. That is crucial if we are going to be able to continue to have a common currency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before I go into the substance, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and all representatives of the political groups who actively participated in the process for all their valuable contributions. I am equally thankful to the Commission, and the Commissioner himself, for their efforts to facilitate discussions, not only during the trilogues here in Parliament but within the Council too.</p>
      <p sl="en">The six legislative texts on economic governance have been the number one priority of the Hungarian Presidency. I must emphasise that it was not the individual decision of the Presidency to designate this file as the top priority. The Commission’s initiative has also been supported by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States. If we want to build a stronger euro, this governance package is an essential building block in that process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The world economy, including Europe, has experienced the worst crisis since the Great Depression and we have had to draw the necessary conclusions. We have to realise that the shock would have long-lasting effects unless we eliminate the core roots of the crisis. Many of the lessons to be learned are addressed by the six legislative proposals put forward by the Commission last September. More emphasis will be put on prevention in order to avoid the need for harmful procyclical policies in bad economic times.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has concentrated on deficit but this has not prevented the accumulation of high debt, so from now on more attention will be paid to the debt criteria. The lesson was learned that procedures have not been stringent and automatic enough. That is why we are also addressing these questions here, in order to strengthen the credibility of the Pact. We have also realised that coordination of fiscal policies through the SGP might not be sufficient in a Union sharing a single currency so we have agreed to introduce a new mechanism to tackle macroeconomic imbalances, which will be treated on the same footing as fiscal imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to better and more deeply reflect the requirements of the Treaty in national procedures of Member States, we are about to adopt rules improving the quality of national budgetary frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that the objectives of both Parliament and the Council are the same, namely to strengthen the economic governance of the EU and the euro area, prevent future crises and build a stronger framework for economic governance in the euro area and the EU as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">After an intensive round of trilogues with the rapporteurs and discussions at the Council, the Council modified its general approach on Monday. The result of this process was communicated to the European Parliament by a letter sent the next day, 21 June. I share the view that during the trilogues the quality of the text has improved a lot, and that the package has become stronger and more coherent. This is especially the case in terms of increased transparency and accountability and the more stringent and automatic application of the procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, let me mention the major elements as regards increased transparency and accountability. We are to describe the European semester in the legal text including the ample involvement of Parliament in the process. We have added provisions specifying the process of economic dialogue among European institutions including the European Parliament, the Council and individual Member States. The European Parliament would be involved on the same footing as the Council in the setting up and functioning of the scoreboard of indicators for an alert mechanism in the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. Regarding the governance cycle and the surveillance procedure, we fully respect the very important role of relevant national stakeholders, including social partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, turning to the issue relating to a more stringent and automatic application of the procedures, let me mention the following: an additional sanction, an interest-bearing deposit for Member States in the excessive imbalance procedure, would be introduced. This has been a missing link in the procedures and it completes the procedure in a very logical way, similar to that provided for in the budgetary surveillance. An additional fine for Member States falsifying their fiscal statistics is also provided for, at the initiative of the Parliament. The application of reverse qualified majority voting is expanded to the recommendation on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. Moreover, in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, we make provision for a review of the expansion of reverse qualified majority voting. At the same time, the already existing comply-or-explain procedure would be enhanced. In deciding on the staff in the SGP, the Council is expected, as a rule, to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission or to explain its position publicly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency believes that the compromise reached during the trilogues reflects a good, balanced and comprehensive approach. We think that all parties have a strong interest in reaching a swift agreement. I regret that the proposal put forward to the plenary is different from the compromise we arrived at after a series of negotiation rounds and does not take into account the final compromise offer of the Council. At the same time, I am grateful for your wise approach that the Parliament still leaves open the possibility to have a first reading agreement shortly. It is high time that Europe joined forces and the Union is ready to live up to expectations. All the markets and investors are vigilant and would like to see whether we can deliver or not. The swift and timely adoption of the package is a must for all of us.</p>

You have achieved the opportunity for detailed discussion of country-specific situations at every key decision-making stage of the policy cycle, including confirmation of Parliament’s right to initiate dialogue with individual Member States. In all parts of the legislation you have won a better information flow to Parliament and more transparency. You have got a commitment from the Commission to do a study on euro securities within six months of the entry into force of this legislation. This will be accompanied by a Commission declaration, the text of which you have seen, setting out the scope for that report. I will come back to that as well. The Commission will also commit itself in this declaration to reviewing the intergovernmental nature of the European Stabilisation Mechanism by mid-2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have got reverse qualified majority voting in a number of important cases – to improve the automaticity of decision-making – as the rule in the corrective arm of the Pact, where 24 Member States out of 27 now find themselves unfortunately. You have also won an equal role for Parliament in determining the scoreboard for detecting possible macroeconomic imbalances, and you have inserted firm guarantees on social dialogue, respect for national traditions on collective agreements, wage formation, and the role of social partners, which we fully share.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are going to be tough fines for statistical fraud and guarantees of independence for national statistical authorities. You have introduced earlier sanctions in the excessive imbalances procedure. I could go on and on.</p>
      <p sl="en">In your first legislative encounter with Ecofin as a co-legislator in economic policy, you achieved almost all of your most important objectives. This is a very good result for Parliament and for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">On euro securities, in the context of this package I will only confirm what I said at the trilogue on 15 June. The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the setting up of a system of common issuance of European sovereign bonds, or euro securities, under joint and several liability, in line with Article 8a(5) of the regulation on the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area and within six months of the entry into force of that Regulation. These euro securities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability through markets as well as, by taking advantage of the increase in liquidity, ensuring that the Member States enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates. The report will, if appropriate, be accompanied by legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, in our view such a report on euro securities goes hand in glove with and only makes sense with the prospective reinforcement of economic governance in line with this package now under deliberation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a few words on the next steps. I am worried. Should the package not be agreed, neither the Council nor Parliament should think that they can successfully shift the responsibility onto the other. That will not work. People watching the decision-making from outside are not interested in the smallest detail. If we fail – and I say we and I really mean us all – they will simply say that ‘Europe’ has failed. Europe would fail and people’s trust in the capacity of Europe to address their real problems would suffer a huge blow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, neither institution should imagine even for a moment that – whether for tactical or substantive reasons – they might get a better deal in the second reading. The Presidency has very skilfully extracted compromises from the Council that would most likely not appear on the table again if a first reading agreement could not be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Actually only one issue remains open: the scope of reverse qualified majority voting. I believe you are all aware of the efforts we have made. The Commission supports reverse qualified majority voting. So does the ECB and a number of Member States, but not all of them and not in all places. The Council has already agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in five out of six decisions where it is legally possible. On the remaining one, there is a disagreement between Parliament and the Council. I believe a solution can and must be found. Therefore I appeal to you to seek a constructive solution on the remaining point in the next few days and I appeal to the Council too, to respond with a constructive approach on their part.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can reassure you that the Commission will work until the last minute, the last second, to find a satisfactory solution. Reinforced economic governance in Europe is simply too important to fail on this final remaining issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us recall that the Council is about to sign the treaty on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which focuses on correction. But the ESM will only complement the new framework for reinforced economic surveillance, which focuses on prevention and is of primary essence because it will substantially reduce the probability of crises such as we have experienced emerging in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude with a simple message. If there is no agreement this week and no vote by the latest in July, it will be a very bad deal for Europe and for Europe’s citizens. And it would only result in frustration, bitterness and a worse outcome for everyone if we must come back to these files in September.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have agreed on 99.9% of the substance. I now ask both sides to go the last few centimetres to reach an agreement with the other. It is of paramount importance, since this package really is the cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the crisis that is still ongoing. It is absolutely crucial for the credibility of the European Union to conclude the package before the summer break, and then move on and put it into effective use.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make three groups of points on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is that as we adopt this economic governance package, we must ensure that the whole of the Treaty of Lisbon is taken into account. According to the Treaty, taking into consideration objectives concerned with promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social welfare and combating social exclusion is a cross-cutting aim that applies to this economic governance package also. If I may say so, I sometimes get the impression that this aim has been relegated to a secondary priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen for the whole package to be based not only on Article 121 of the Treaty, which deals with the coordination of economic policies, but on Article 148 also, which deals with employment policy in terms of coordination between the responsibilities of Member States and the European level. This is also why we feel that within the Union, the role of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) must be firmly guaranteed, on a par with that of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin).</p>
      <p sl="fr">For if – and this brings me to my second group of points – in revising the Stability and Growth Pact our only objective is the kind of governance that will satisfy the rating agencies, then we will be missing an important opportunity in the history of our economic and monetary union. History calls us today to take a much more overall view and to look closely at the purposes for which this economic governance is being put in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course we need to reduce debt, but we also need to ensure that this economic governance helps to guarantee the success of the Europe 2020 strategy. In this respect, we believe there are other approaches that could have been used. Commissioner, why is it that only spending on pensions can be given special treatment in your assessment of Member States’ medium-term budget objectives? Why is it that this special treatment cannot also be given to the investment in the future represented by spending on education, or the spending we need to undertake to combat social exclusion, a goal that you set and that we included in the Europe 2020 strategy? Why is it that these aims and this kind of approach are not also applied to spending on research and development or infrastructures?</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third group of points relates to how macroeconomic surveillance is conducted. We consider it to be an essential outcome of this package, but this means it must be applied symmetrically. Ultimately, for us here in the European Parliament, there is a fundamental issue at stake. Mrs Ford spoke of it as a power struggle. It is not a power struggle, it is a question of democracy. If we want there to be European economic governance, there needs to be a space for public debate and for European democracy, in order for this European economic policy to work. In this respect, I have to say that your refusal and that of the Council to allow the European Parliament to participate in establishing macroeconomic indicators through delegated acts does not seem to me to be the right approach.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many of the amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been taken into account by the six-pack rapporteurs. We are sending the message that a society can only have a healthy economy when its members are able to contribute fully to its development. A healthy economy is the basis for a good level of employment and social policies, and vice versa, a good level of employment and social policies are preconditions for a healthy economy. Those Member States which had the most prudent fiscal policies and growth strategies are now performing best. This is the proof that fiscal stability leads to growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is essential to achieve growth and jobs and to prevent the debt burden being placed on our children and future generations. We have to understand that every euro used in paying interest on the public debt is one which does not go towards investment in education, social security and other fields that provide a necessary environment for the good development of the economy and for the well-being of the people. Therefore it is essential that our indebtedness in the Member States is reduced as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are undoubtedly many reasons for the economic situation in which we currently find ourselves in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole, but two stand out in particular. Firstly, we were basically far too late in realising the direction in which Europe was sailing. Secondly, when we did realise it, the Council in particular refused for a long time to initiate the necessary measures – which are actually provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact – or to impose the necessary sanctions. To put it bluntly, it simply failed to pull the ripcord.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new regulation on macroeconomic surveillance should deal with these two problems. Firstly, the completely new system it provides should enable us to recognise macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage; and secondly, we should then be able to act quickly. We have developed a good scoreboard, albeit through long discussions. I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, for her positive cooperation in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to ensure that immediate measures are taken to counter imbalances. That is precisely why it is necessary for a mechanism to be developed here that cannot be politically torpedoed. That is why the use of reversed qualified majority voting is so important and so fundamental for Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels. That is more than likely necessary anyway in an economic and monetary union. Only when the citizens of Europe see that we are now acting effectively, that we have learnt from the mistakes we have made, will we be able to regain the trust that has currently been lost.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can assure you that my group will be supporting the Ferreira report tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you will not find many members in this room who disagree with the need to drag down debt and deficits to reasonable levels in the years ahead. My group certainly takes the view that we need to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not about political confrontation between fiscally virtuous or fiscally irresponsible Members in this House. The division between you and us and between progressives and conservatives here in the House is about how we return to sound public finances, at what economic and social cost, at what cost for the future ability of Europe to compete in a global market. You stick to the idea, Commissioner, that there is no alternative to your austerity-only agenda. We think that this is very wrong. In our view, your approach and that of the right-wing majority in the Council pose the biggest threat to the very future of the European idea because they are destroying the notion of belonging to a community, the notions of solidarity and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The vast majority of the millions who have lost their jobs during this crisis are unemployed still today. What message does the Council and Commission have for them? Or for the millions whose jobs are in jeopardy or who are living in poverty? What message for the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering as a result of cutbacks in public provision, in healthcare, in education? What message for them? What message from the Council this week? Well, I expect nothing quite frankly, nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This week’s Council will not produce a single ray of hope for hardworking people, for the unemployed or the young people who are hurting so much. They have been unfairly and severely hit by the crisis that was not of their making and now they will be hit again to repair the damage they did not cause.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your political and economic agenda is totally unacceptable to us on this side of the House. Throughout the legislative process, we have suggested sensible and balanced amendments to the Commission’s proposals, we have proposed firmly connecting national reform and stability and growth programmes using the first as a solid vehicle for the necessary promotion of public investment We made proposals to maintain sensible levels of productive public investment and we have proposed making the new rules clearly anti-cyclical. I could go on, but the reality is that today’s economic and social agenda has been hijacked by the right. There is not even space for moderate political approaches, let alone more progressive ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">And please, Commissioner Rehn, do not tell me that these policies I am denouncing are being pursued by socialist governments. You know, at a time when even the strongest economies in Europe need to bow to the demands of an irresponsible and increasingly dangerous financial sector, that no Member State can change this agenda alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the end, I wonder who will benefit from the decisions that will be made this week. It seems to me that the only people who will benefit are those who have caused the whole mess in the first place, the financial sector, and I think that is a disgrace.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, so far we have found agreement on almost all of the package and have demonstrated that codecision is working, with thanks to the hard work of the Hungarian Presidency and of course to András Kármán in particular, and to the Parliament negotiating team and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Presidency and Commission have already highlighted numerous – I think it was 50 – Parliament additions. These include a legal framework for the Semester and surveillance of national reform programmes, independence of national statistical offices and fines for fraud, Commission surveillance missions, an economic dialogue between all stakeholders, and substantially greater transparency throughout.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot conceal, though, that there have been significant differences in the negotiation of the package. For my part, I do not see this as political grandstanding but rather the search for ownership, to enable ownership by the people. What divides us in Parliament differs from our issues with the Council but, however difficult it may be, we have to stand up to our democratic duty. It is this House that will confer ownership.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some prefer intergovernmentalism. Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense. Nor does it make sense in the search for ownership – so distinctly missing in much of the response to the crisis and so much a consequence of intergovernmental decisions. From the realisation that the Stability Fund facilities had to be larger, to recognising the fact that punitive interest rates do not give sustainability and the chance to return to the markets, this House has not been afraid to lead and the Council has followed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are stronger when we work together and I believe the final differences can be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the package of six proposals intended to improve discipline within the euro area is based on the belief that the Member States will comply more rigorously with the newly created and stricter architecture for supranational surveillance. I regard it as problematic to think along these lines, particularly since some Member States have been incapable of following the less stringent rules to date, and effectively enforcing their implementation. I would like to mention four points which I consider controversial.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The first is reverse qualified majority voting, which has already been referred to many times in this Chamber. We regard reverse qualified majority voting as an instrument to be used in exceptional cases, the use of which must always be explained properly and thoroughly, with proper checks carried out to ensure that its use is consistent with primary law.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We do not agree with the increase in the number of areas subject to surveillance procedures for which the use of reverse qualified majority voting is proposed. The proposed approach will increase the political power of the Commission and the European Parliament to the detriment of the Council and the national authorities, which is not what we want.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With regard to surveillance missions, I have serious reservations concerning the proposal for such missions, since they will be composed mainly of European Commission officials and will have significant powers entrusted to them, without the members of these missions having any political mandate. This is a fundamental reservation. People who are not subject to public control by voters, however good their intentions may be, cannot carry out surveillance over the heads of national political bodies or the highest national institutions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The scoreboard, which attempts to draw up a list of macroeconomic indicators at supranational level and, based on this list, to assess the ability of national authorities and their economies to deal with economic imbalances, is a contentious idea. The current situation in Greece is a good example of the fact that solutions to a situation dictated from outside provoke opposition from the country’s inhabitants, and are one of the causes of escalating social tension.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Greens want economic governance. Not just to please people, not so that it will make a nice photo, but simply to give the European people instruments, by building on the euro, that will enable them to meet the challenges of the 21st century, in other words to ensure a decent standard of living for everyone, not just for the happy few, and to do it within the planet’s physical limitations – and this is what is new, of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this respect, we support these reports on the budget frameworks and the macroeconomic component of the ‘economic governance’ package. We are satisfied with all the indicators that have been selected, even though we would have liked one of them to have been income inequalities, as they are a very clear sign of both a poorly functioning economy and a poorly functioning society and should therefore act as a warning sign.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, our agreement on the macroeconomic component is conditional upon maintaining a symmetrical approach, and this is a point I make to the Council. In other words, we believe that all the Member States should be in the same boat, whether they have a current deficit or a surplus, for example. There is no reason why we should apply favouritism, as one country’s surplus is another country’s deficit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot accept an instrument whose only outcome is and will remain austerity, austerity and more austerity, in other words which will result in making only the most vulnerable in our societies pay for the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We wanted balance, not by having less budget discipline but by combining it with disciplined investment. Our proposal was to make the goals that Europe set itself with the EU 2020 strategy not only binding, but as binding as each other and as binding as the rules on the budget or on deficits. I am disappointed that a majority could not be found in this Parliament to finally back this strategy and take it more seriously.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We might have agreed to vote in favour of this stability and growth package unchanged had it been accompanied by an ambitious fiscal package, combining a financial transaction tax, an energy tax, a fair tax on transnational corporations and, of course, measures to combat tax fraud, so that we could help the Union’s Member States fund the goals they hope to achieve. However, there was not the slightest sign of this. There is absolutely nothing in the pipeline, despite the declarations that Mr Barroso has made again today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say this to the right: you chose to form a narrow majority with the eurosceptics, as you were free to do, in order to create a form of economic governance which I can tell you now is unfair and will be ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will see what happens, therefore, either in this Parliament when your pact with the eurosceptics has fallen through, or at the polls in France in 2010 and in Germany in 2013, where I think the voters will agree with us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009. However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries. For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market. Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of this is to be found in the economic governance package. Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe. As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole. This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The much-needed improvements on the Commission’s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there – particularly in Mrs Ferreira’s report – have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council. In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable. As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with. This is reserved for the Commission. It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our view, the economic governance package – at least in its present form – is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form.</p>

      <p sl="it">The euro area was not and has not become an optimal currency zone. A country hit by the financial crisis finds it more difficult to recover and could well drag other Member States into the abyss. From Maastricht onwards, criteria have existed which are designed to prevent dangerous situations, and we have seen how miserably they have failed. In 1999 Greece did not meet any criteria, and only two years later it was already in the euro. Portugal, moreover, was the first country to receive warnings in 2002 about its deficit position.</p>

      <p sl="de">We can now explain the concept of economic governance even to highly eurosceptic people, but not if it has no democratic legitimacy and there are no checks and balances. How is it supposed to work if, on the one hand, a protectorate is de facto established – Greece – and on the other the taxpayers in better-off nations have their bonds plundered via the European Central Bank and the bad banks? How can you explain to people who were adamant that they should not give up the schilling and the mark that we now suddenly need Eurobonds simply because the banks cannot be kept in check – by the way, Mr Hughes, it is very nice that the social democrats have now realised this. The only way I can imagine that is if we finally give in and say we should have done this, that or the other at the time; if we admit our mistakes and, as Europe burns around us, finally put forward a vision in which we are able to survive globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, it is the case that homes are typically designed by people with higher education, but are typically built by people who barely have secondary education. What is more, if, during the construction of a home, there happens to be a building worker who is either foolish or dishonest, and does not pour the necessary amount of concrete into the foundations as called for in the design, then the home will be crooked. In the case of the eurozone, the foundations, the stability foundations, were laid with the Stability and Growth Pact. Unfortunately it has come to pass that various Member States – perhaps like lazy or careless building workers – did not adhere to the stability pact and created excessively large government debts, budget deficits. When the world economic crisis came about, this eurozone house began to totter. If the eurozone were a house, then logically, we should have to set to work again and lay new foundations. In this case we have a completed economic governance package, which we should approve, in the way of reinforced foundations, so that in the future, when the next storm comes along, the eurozone cannot totter. In addition, if we want to have some idea of what this tottering looks like, we need only look at events in Greece. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to avoid the situation where in the future our house could totter once more, and the solution is to approve the economic government package.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council. Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council. This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach. Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur? In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council – or did you forget to mention that? If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant. I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The world would subsequently be worse, not better – because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package. That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us. Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense. Exactly the opposite is true. To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – who run after either the Commission or the Council – I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves. That is what the voters expect of us. I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow. You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy. We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so. We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence. I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this – more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens. You have derailed it, and that is a pity. Consequently, this package is by no means balanced.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is in a difficult situation, but it is precisely in times of crisis that the EU is usually able to take bold decisions. The fact that tomorrow we will be able to take a decision on stricter and clearer rules for economic governance is extremely important, not just for the countries within the euro area. Everyone will be affected. Europe’s leaders have hesitated and created uncertainty. The nervousness has spread. Their message changed from day to day. The decision tomorrow will be able to demonstrate that Parliament is able to take difficult decisions in difficult times. Greece used deceit to enable it to join the euro area. That is true. That is precisely why the German and French leaders are now showing clear leadership and taking responsibility for Europe’s future, rather than continuing to talk in unclear, muted tones.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Stability and Growth Pact must be reformed and the rules tightened up. Pacta sunt servanda – agreements must be kept – not a new Greece! In Sweden, we know that the way to stability and growth is through healthy state finances. Mr Bullman can ask the Swedish members of his group. It is my hope that the Swedish Social Democrats will be able to support this proposal, particularly as we have managed to get rules through that safeguard the Swedish collective agreements. Now the last impediment is being removed to enable the Swedish Social Democrats to be instrumental in Sweden becoming a member of the Euro Plus Pact. If Sweden is to belong to the EU’s inner circle, we cannot simply trudge along behind EU critics from Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. That is not good company to keep.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I find myself in a difficult position in this debate as I believe that strong fiscal rules are necessary for a strong currency and a strong economy. This, I believe, was the fundamental reason why my country did not join the euro. Monetary union was always going to be difficult without significant steps towards economic union and it is this latter requirement which means I do not think the UK will ever join the euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">For my political group here in Parliament, national sovereignty over decisions on economic policy is a fundamental principle. If all six of these reports and their rules only apply to the euro zone, we would be able to more actively support the Euro Group in their decision to strengthen the principles that underpin their monetary union. If all the Member States who use the euro want to strengthen and deepen the coordination of their economic policies, then that should be their decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK and other non-euro-zone countries want to be good neighbours. However, attempts to bind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and processes designed to harmonise economic policy are unacceptable. I do not wish to see the euro zone in prolonged difficulty, but the ECR cannot support EU legislation that transfers any further powers away from national governments who are currently outside of that euro zone.</p>
      <p sl="en">All Member States will hopefully have learned the lessons of the crisis, namely that a balanced budget and strong fiscal discipline are rewarded by lower funding costs in the financial markets, and that honesty in statistical reporting is essential for continued market confidence. Fundamentally, a strong euro zone and the euro as a global currency are in all of our interests. New rules need to ensure it is made stronger and more sustainable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to see strong European economic governance. This means that on the one hand we need strong rules for dealing with imbalances – as set out in Mrs Ferreira’s report – and naturally we also need sanctions for these. That is why we will be voting in favour of these two reports, just as we will for the report by Mrs Ford, which provides the statistical basis for our economic cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Likewise, as regards the three reports on the Stability and Growth Pact: a common euro, and in addition we need limits in Europe on deficits and debt. Such limits have been exceeded in this crisis. However, it is important to consider how the deficits and debt are reduced. At present we are seeing time and again in Greece, Portugal and Ireland that, under pressure from the European Commission, in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer, and in which the wealthy – who did very well out of the previous 20 years – are left alone. This has shaken people’s faith in the process. That is why we in the Group of the Greens want the EU2020 objectives to be fully binding in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the reports, and also the deficit and debt objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">In not accepting this, ladies and gentlemen of the liberal and conservative groups, you have opted out of one of the principles of social cohesion in Europe. We cannot support that. We consider it highly regrettable, because we would have liked to have seen a broad pro-European majority here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, for us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this economic governance package is not only the wrong response to the crisis; it also marks the end of Europe as we know it. Its objective is not economic coordination and fiscal discipline, as it maintains; it is to impose a permanent austerity memorandum throughout Europe, on all the workers. The objective of the ‘European semester’ and national stability and reform programmes is not convergence; it is to abolish collective agreements, liberalise redundancies, privatise industry and do away with public pension systems.</p>
      <p sl="el">These policies do not serve the interests of the people of Europe or their hope of real growth. On the contrary, they serve the interests of the banks, which have knowingly kept toxic bonds subject to large-scale international speculation on their books, and the interests of large corporations which have found, in the common market, a haven for speculation and tax evasion. I would mention, by way of example, the German company Hochtief, which manages Athens Airport; it has not paid a euro since 2001 and owes EUR 500 million in VAT.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is a great deal of discussion about Greece. For a year now, the essence of the economic governance package has been applied to my country with disastrous consequences: the recession is getting worse, inflation has gone through the roof, investments have completely dried up, labour rights and collective agreements have basically been repealed, the biggest drop in the cost of labour has been in Europe, unemployment has reached 20% and debt has increased, fuelling a dangerous vicious circle of recession, debt and more borrowing. That is why angry Greek workers have taken to the streets and squares, fighting to get austerity policies overturned, to defend their income and to defend their labour and social rights, real growth and a better future for Greece and Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Some may say these ideas are elementary. They must nonetheless be repeated time and again because nobody listens to them. It is for this very reason, that is to say not listening, that we are living in dark times, as anticipated by the poet Bertolt Brecht.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible. It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need. A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible. Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups. However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission’s proposal, the Council’s position and what is now on the table – which will be put to the vote tomorrow – if they are examined objectively. This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn. By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static. Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans. It is not responsible at this juncture to say ‘I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day’. Responsibility means walking.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow’s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July. As another poet used to say – Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry – poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone.</p>

      <p sl="mt">The six reports on economic governance amount to a complex package for the European Union, especially for the eurozone. Those who put the package together find it hard enough to explain and it is even harder for people on the outside to understand it. It is understandable that people are perplexed, both by the crisis that is unravelling before them, and by our unclear and timid reaction to it. This is why the responsibility lies with us to explain our voting choices to our constituents; to say whether we are for or against each and every one of these reports. Briefly, the package which the Commission presented us with was intended to cover the three phases of how one should react to the crisis. Primarily, this package focuses on crisis prevention, mitigation and solution. The Wortmann-Kool, Feio and Goulard report discuss the use of sanctions at length as the main tools required to prevent a country from reaching dangerous deficit and debt levels, and the scenarios that arise when these countries ignore the various warnings issued to them on their dire fiscal situation. Originally, the reports squabbled over the severity of the fines that should be imposed, although later on more moderate suggestions were accepted. The hardest and more creative way of mitigating the crisis, by avoiding macroeconomic imbalances through the use of scoreboards that determine the targets to be reached, was left to the Ferreira report. Despite technical restrictions and other pressures, this report managed at least to attain a minimum set of desired objectives. Anyone hoping to find a solution to the current crisis within this package will be doing so in vain. This package lacks well thought out, sensible ideas by European and foreign economists on how the affected countries can overcome this crisis. One report that made an effort to build a consensus on securities for the euro was side-lined at the last minute by the Council and has now simply been shelved by the Commission, accompanied by a promise to carry out further studies on the subject. We have nothing in hand that is concrete; we have merely ended up with a promise unto a promise. We must keep in mind that the whole point of this exercise was to help Europe get back to its feet, to pull it out of the mire and to ensure that it can move forward and become globally competitive. For this reason, we should not oppose the idea that eurozone countries need to reduce their excess fiscal burdens. We agree that nobody should compete while carrying around such a heavy burden. However, one cannot accept the imposition of a crash diet that would only serve to further sicken and weaken. Europe needs to build some economic muscle; it needs creative schemes in order to strengthen economic growth and create jobs. It is greatly disappointing that after all these months, not one of the intelligent proposals that were on the cards ended up in this package.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline. Reality has now caught up with us. The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed.</p>
      <p sl="de">A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The EU is now trying a new approach. To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot. If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe. The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation. I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined. There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise. The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless. What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission. What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting. This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end. What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again.</p>

I find the package we agreed last Wednesday to be very well balanced and I therefore have the honour to inform you, Commissioner, that the Belgian delegation within the European Conservatives and Reformists will be endorsing this package.</p>

Yesterday, Gideon Rachman wrote in the Financial Times that you cannot cure alcohol poisoning with a bottle of vodka. I have had theological debates on this issue with Mrs Goulard. We could not agree, but I admire her as an opponent. I also think that the theory of economic imbalances is rather vague and unclear. It is not true that Germany has a trade surplus because Portugal has a trade deficit. That really would read like ‘EU economics for dummies’.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the package of economic governance measures creates an strong tool for imposing capitalist restructurings in a uniform manner and a uniform strategy in all the Member States, in order to strengthen the competitiveness, profitability and power of capital. This is a permanent memorandum for the working classes in all the Member States of the European Union. The vulgar propaganda about Greece’s, Ireland’s, Portugal’s and other countries’ debts and deficits is designed to blame the rights acquired by the working classes and to conceal the real culprit, which is capitalism and its monopolies. The ideological terrorism of the bourgeois class being promoted is that the only way out is to slaughter the workers so as to keep the profitability of capital intact.</p>
      <p sl="el">Between 1985 and 2011 alone, apart from the immeasurable wealth appropriated by capital from exploiting the working class in Greece, monopoly capital at home and abroad plundered EUR 628 billion in interest and repayments, either as lender or borrower.</p>
      <p sl="el">The working class owes nothing to those who have robbed them of what they earned by the sweat of their brow. On the contrary, they are owed all the wealth plundered by capital.

In my opinion, if overindebted economies want to remain in the euro area then they must be subjected to strict budgetary control instead. The sort of centralisation which takes the form of Brussels exerting budgetary authority over all the Member States represents improper intervention in the sovereignty of the Member States, however, and would moreover reduce the sound countries of Europe to mere playthings of EU bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is obvious, however, that to get an agreement is one thing – and it is our duty here – but to see its practical implementation and then to benefit from new rules will be yet another challenge.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security. Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment. The contents of this ‘governance’ package – and I call them ‘contents’ deliberately – that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations. They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis. In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission. They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès? They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned! Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State’s creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today’s investments are tomorrow’s jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits. This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ‘governance’ package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros. They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance. They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to the votes, socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package, which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe.

They originate basically in increasingly neoliberal EU policies that concentrate financial and political power in the hands of the few.</p>

What are the most important points, at this stage, to help us appraise the work that has been done? The fact that we have this package today, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament, already constitutes considerable progress. It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro, and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this.</p>

There is always room for improvement, of course, but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed.

      <p sl="fr">To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model, I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead, instead, to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our citizens want a strong and effective European Union. Sluggishness, inadequacy and a purely intergovernmental vision are worsening the impact of the crisis and weakening the credibility of the European project.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are not facing problems that are purely national, or a crisis that is only economic; we are facing a political crisis that requires a swift, full, Europeanist response.</p>
      <p sl="es">The basic concepts of ‘economy’ and ‘union’ in the Economic and Monetary Union must be strengthened. The proposal presented today on economic governance must be considerably improved if we are going to achieve that.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are in favour of creating national budgetary frameworks that guarantee transparency, economic coordination and verification of compliance with European commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe it is necessary to correct macroeconomic imbalances and move toward convergence, and we find that the Ferreira report makes particular progress in that area.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the proposals to reform the Stability and Growth Pact are incomplete: they confuse stability with adjustment, and they entrust growth policies to the market and the national sphere. Avoiding Europe’s commitment to investment and employment is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will not be complicit in this attempt to make Europe turn its back on its citizens and its own interests; we are not resigned to impassively pondering the way in which our problems are getting worse; and we do not accept double standards. We need unanimity to provide resources and qualified majority decisions to avoid penalties.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must pledge our commitment to Europe and do it quickly. The European Parliament should work hard to make an ambitious, Europeanist response worthy of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to move forwards, not backwards like crabs. Europe must not hide when it is needed most.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, although the United Kingdom is not a member of the euro zone – and I hope it never will be – we have a vested interest in its success. I wish the euro zone well and I regret that I am unable to support the proposals on economic governance we are debating tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposals before us grant the Commission sweeping new powers. Had these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone, I would not have objected, but instead we see the Commission and many Members in this Parliament – including Ms Wortmann-Kool, for whom I have the utmost respect – using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the EU into the economic governance of the United Kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro. I was not elected to grant the EU more powers over the way the United Kingdom governs its affairs and I shall therefore vote against these proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the debate reflects the unresolved issues of economic policy in Europe. Whilst we have a central monetary policy, there is local responsibility for budgetary and finance policies. The attempts by some Greek Members to shift the responsibility for Greece’s internal political competence onto Europe, or to third parties, to capitalist banks, or to whomever, can only be a mistake.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">It was the Greek communists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fortunately, the euro is stable both internally and externally. What we are dealing with is not a crisis of the euro, but rather a sovereign debt crisis. That is where we must start. It is pointless – even the state cannot live beyond its means indefinitely. It is pointless adding further debt to existing debts without accepting the consequences of necessary reforms. That is why I say it is high time that we acted. Parliament has been calling for measures for a long time. The Commission has now proposed that the Stability and Growth Pact be tightened up. The Hungarian Presidency has negotiated well, as has our side. I actually think it a pity, Mr Bullmann – for on many aspects of regulation of the financial markets we are very much in agreement – that the socialists still want to distinguish between good and bad debt. That is the wrong way to go. When we draw up the balance sheets to see which countries of Europe have got into difficulties there is no need to defame anyone; it is easy to see. There were socialist governments everywhere that these budgetary and financial problems have arisen. Hungary, Latvia, Romania, outside the euro area, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Greece too, apart from a break of four years, when our lot were in. In other words, your economic model does not work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Really, Mr Bütikofer, you should know better by now. We cannot absolve the Greeks of responsibility here and I will say quite frankly that the Greeks were not the first to contravene the Stability and Growth Pact; rather it was the two big ones, Germany and France. We also objected to that and changed it. You were in the government at the time, Mr Bütikofer. You dug the grave – it was your party that dug the grave of the Stability and Growth Pact, not the Greeks. Now, however, it is for the Greeks to …</p>

I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr Rehn from the EU2020 package, such as research and development and the fight against poverty. This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems.</p>

      <p sl="fr">First, Greece: let us not try to re-write history. This was a right-wing government which for two terms of office disguised the figures with the help of Goldman Sachs Bank. Today, a left-wing government is trying to get things back into shape. Is it the people who should be paying for the mistakes made on the advice of banking corporations?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second example: in my country, Belgium, under a government with left-wing participation led by our fellow Member Mr Dehaene, in 12 years we reduced our debt from 130% of GDP to 80%.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am very familiar with the proposals made by Mr Bullmann and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. The only problem with them was that they primarily want more money. The problem cannot be solved by throwing more money at it. As Mr Tarabella has just confirmed, there are opportunities for debt reduction even with socialist involvement. I want to spell it out that the reforms that have taken place in Greece have done nothing to result in the large amount of private Greek wealth genuinely sharing the burden of the costs of the state. On the contrary: since 1 January EUR 59 billion has been withdrawn from Greek bank deposits by Greek citizens, and since 1 January EUR 12 billion of Greek government bonds have been sold. I am demanding that the many wealthy parties in Greece participate actively, and this must be regulated by policy. If they can accept responsibility, then they will be able to benefit from our solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by paying tribute to all those who have been working hard on this package of late, but I also support the previous speakers from my group. To us, this package is not sufficient and it is not balanced. This is not so much a matter of technical detail, but of essence: what are we putting the emphasis upon? What should be the objectives for a more integrated economic policy? It is therefore not true that we do not want European economic governance, but we do need to ask ourselves how we should define it, what the essence of European economic governance is. Obviously, the current crisis has made it clear that a monetary union also requires economic cooperation. It seems that some sort of design error has crept into our financial blueprint and we need to rectify that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For us, this is about much more than just agreeing to cuts and achieving budgetary objectives. Yes, Mr Langen and ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed in favour of sound public finances, but what is key for us is how we can all move forward, how we can crawl out of this morass. How we can prepare for the future and, therefore, how we can create growth and employment through a common economic policy. In other words, by integrating an ambitious investment strategy into the system, by forging a link with the 2020 objectives, or to put it another way, by making joint arrangements, for example, to improve our education system, fight poverty and become more competitive and take on the competition from third countries through investment in research and development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By the way, it amazes me that some members, as was the case with Mr Verhofstadt just yesterday, are advocating an investment strategy while being content with this package. For me, personally, that is not consistent. We therefore consider the ‘six-pack’ to be a missed opportunity to put genuine economic governance in place.</p>

    <intervention id="3-213-000" speaker_id="1832" name="Marianne Thyssen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a very deep crisis, and not only one from which we have to ensure that we extricate ourselves, but also one which we must prevent ourselves from ever landing in again. It is for that very reason that we need a strong legislative framework and for that very reason that we, as a co-legislator, as Parliament, also have to shoulder our responsibilities. After all, we are the generation that is currently deciding the future of our children.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have the courage to push through such a set of rules. We must now have the courage to decide what action is needed. We must also have the courage to choose to push such decisions through, to ensure they are complied with, even if that means we have to swim against the tide. We understand the people who are taking to the streets to protest and, what is more, what we are doing is giving a precise structural answer to those people’s concerns: good jobs, sustainable growth and room in the future for an adequate social policy. If we want to remain a relevant player in a globalised economy, then we have to ensure greater coordination between economic and budgetary policies, as well as greater coordination between the economic policy and the policy on the competitiveness of Member States. To that end, we obviously need investment in the economy but what we need, first of all, is to ensure that no one is allowed the liberty to depart from agreed rules without a valid reason, because that means dragging others into the quagmire as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The package that eventually came out of the negotiations provides a strong answer to those requirements, and it also provides an answer to the mistakes of the past. The only thing is – and this is prompted by our behaviour in the past – that we must further strengthen the preventive aspect of the Stability Pact, because if a Member State goes down the wrong road, then we cannot allow it to become subject to political bargaining in the Council, which is ultimately what the response from Europe will be.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore hope that we here will be casting a vote in favour, that we will support this package, but also that we will give ourselves the opportunity to start a final round of negotiations with the Council in order to strengthen this point further.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are witnessing a paradox. The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry. It is like a body that stands on two legs, but one is much longer and more developed than the other. The leg that controls fiscal policy is muscular and articulated, while the one that controls development policy, which should provide impetus and long-term drive, appears spindly and lacking in strength.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis. The difference between those who believe that disorder and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets, economic and trade imbalances and social inequality. We risk confusing cause and effect. We all want public finances to be controlled responsibly, but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to kick-start growth and competitiveness. The main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions. Far less emphasis – too little emphasis – has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy, which Europe should promote and implement.</p>
      <p sl="it">We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve. This is the heterogenesis of purpose. I fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible. All of us, including the Council. The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline. Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says, ‘Let he who is without sin cast the first stone’.</p>
      <p sl="es">What this Parliament wants – and this is what distinguishes it from the Council – is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments, and replace a biased referee with an impartial one.</p>
      <p sl="es">The package is good and deserves to be voted through. When times are hardest, no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more. What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough. The speeches we have heard today have shown several things. We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area. Everyone thought that the current institutional framework – a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies – would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced. That has not been the case. In the good times, their differences only increased; in the bad times, the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins. The ‘no-bailout’ principle, the ‘no-default’ principle, and now the ‘no-exit’ principle could also be out the window.</p>
      <p sl="es">We now find ourselves in Lenin’s ‘What is to be done?’ situation. The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I welcome the issue of Eurobonds. It is a positive step in that direction, but more needs to be done. If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention, so be it. There is a Greek proverb that says, ‘rules are made for man, and not man for rules’.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o’clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o’clock in the morning. From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first step, however, is to vote in favour of this package, which is a good step in the right direction. Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and, as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying, futile effort leads to melancholy and – in politics – to opposition.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate offers the opportunity to address the issue of a new agreement on governance in the European Union, to send a strong and unified message, to restore solidarity to the EU and to dispel speculation.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a fact that in years gone by we have weakened the Stability and Growth Pact. An equally incontrovertible fact is that this was a mistake and we are paying the consequences. We must go back to rules of fiscal discipline, and this is the real issue, the real debate that we must have among ourselves. Procedures should be automatic so that we do not have the same experiences that we had with the old Stability and Growth Pact. I think that there is only one way to get out of the crisis; there are no shortcuts. The answer lies in national policies, in carrying out planned and agreed commitments. Solidarity between EU Member States must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and must respect rules that Member States cannot and must not knowingly violate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Clearly in all this we cannot forget the importance of growth, which brings in internal revenue, and structural reforms to get struggling countries back on their feet. Structural reforms aimed at boosting the competitiveness of economies and the potential for growth must be the priority on the political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="it">I disagree with those who argue that the new Stability and Growth Pact will prevent States from developing. Rather, it will prompt them to clear out the dead wood, to modernise, to undertake those structural reforms that are the trigger for kick-starting the economy. Thanks to these and strict adherence to the rules established by the new Stability and Growth Pact, I am sure that the EU will gain in strength and will be able to face new challenges without assistance policies and, worse still, outdated slogans that lead nowhere and do only damage, especially among the weakest members of society.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the more Parliament boasts of the wonderful progress made on economic governance, the more I want to call on my fellow Members to show some humility, because we are teetering on the edge of the abyss. There are two things to which we need to open our eyes. The first is that the European Parliament has fallen silent during the Greek crisis. We are usually so quick to react to all sorts of events all over the world, with one resolution after another, and yet this fundamental crisis seems to have left us speechless. I deplore the fact that we have been incapable of sending a strong, simple, practical message to the Greek people, to the Member State governments and to Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second item relates to the scope of this package. In voting for these six directives and/or regulations, as I hope we will, we will certainly be taking the euro area a step further, and I mean a step, nothing more, towards the kind of discipline that has been so lacking, and its value will be proven in the future. However, we only need to look at the heated discussions around the reversed qualified majority voting system to see how far we still have to go, when it is rules and automatic sanctions we should be talking about. Some people still see the reversed qualified majority system as something to be scared of. However, we must remain firm on this principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From a strictly political point of view, I am disappointed that the left-wing Members continue to reject the principles of good budget management, against all the evidence. Deficits and sustainable growth cannot go hand in hand. States do need to manage their budgets according to good housekeeping rules, not by revitalisation through public expenditure, which is a short-term sweetener but never a lasting solution.</p>

Therefore, I would like to call for an end to the soapbox speeches, the finger-pointing and the party political game-playing, regardless of where these things are taking place. We need to do the job properly and to respond to the crisis on a step-by-step basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the causes of the crisis? We have constantly been emphasising the fact that the causes include a failure to comply with the rules, the blocking of sanctions and the lack of progress on taking the monetary union to the next stage. With our plans for economic governance, we are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be strengthened, both in terms of preventive and corrective measures, for a majority in favour of the implementation of sanctions and for the Commission to have the right to intervene, when necessary, so that the citizens of Europe can rely on the rules being followed.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that we want the monetary union to be taken to the next stage. This means establishing the economic union and not losing sight of the goal of political union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to say that I am disappointed by the results of the trialogue. It is not functioning properly at the moment. However, the fact that we do not have the Council’s agreement in the dialogue on economic policy and that the European Parliament and the two sides of industry are involved in this is reducing our ability to become more integrated. We want to increase our levels of integration. Because the Council is not able to address the current imbalance in our society and to give Parliament the opportunity of making the ministers from the Member States directly accountable to us, the results of the trialogue are being weakened. We stand by these results. We want to resolve the open issues and bring about integration. If we allow our position to be weakened because of the weakness of the Council, we have not learned any lessons from the crisis.</p>

I would also like to thank in particular the rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission for their really exceptional efforts, culminating in the clarification of this legislative package.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This European economic governance package must be viewed in connection with the other legislative package on the financial sector, including Europe’s financial supervision structure, which has already been adopted.

      <p sl="ro">However, I must express my concern that European institutions are unwilling to acknowledge the economic reality with which we are currently faced. By this I mean that a Member State that has a debt which it can no longer pay cannot receive assistance, thereby adding a new debt to the existing one, with higher costs as well. We have learnt from experience and common sense that the solution lies in the debtor country putting its house in order, with the creditors realising that the debt to be paid needs to be arranged to match the relevant country’s real ability to pay. If we are not going to proceed in this manner, far from saving time, we will waste time and the problem will get worse.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, after listening attentively to today’s debate, I should like to make a few comments, if I may. Firstly, reference has been made very frequently in this Chamber to stimulation of the economy by means of additional budgetary expenditure. I think that the Members concerned are forgetting that there are countries in the European Union – and not just one or two, and not only Greece – which have domestic debt of over 100%, the sole cause of which is stimulation of the economy. As a result, we have achieved a certain level of economic growth, albeit somewhat artificial growth, but we have been left with the bills to pay, and we have to pay them now.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There was talk of restrictive solutions in respect of limiting the deficit. Yet the proposed solutions state that each country is to reduce debt to 60% within 20 years. If 20 years to halve debt is the long-term perspective, what is the short-term perspective? I cannot imagine a longer-term perspective in this situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Is it possible to abandon penalties, or is the penalty system a restrictive system? Fifteen years ago, when I was still a student, I learnt about the convergence criteria, and their mandatory nature. Yet they were only mandatory criteria on paper. If they were mandatory for anyone, it was only for those who aspired to join the euro area, and they were not mandatory for anyone in the euro area. In view of the above, such a system cannot be successfully introduced without penalties, and without restrictive penalties, as some have said. These sanctions existed on paper, but, as we remember and as we know, there have been no real sanctions to date.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My last comment relates to the fact that members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have said that we should implement the 2020 strategy, and not merely cut spending. Yet these very documents talk about a European semester, among other things. They also introduce a new procedure for excessive imbalances. One of the features of this instrument is that it gives the European Commission influence over whether the Member States are implementing the 2020 strategy or not, and so it is worth telling the truth. I would urge you to adopt this package, for a lack of agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on this issue will …</p>

The same problems will face us again and will threaten the whole future of the euro and the EU if we do not have better coordination and more Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the long run the EU is an economic union. We need to get to the core reasons for the problems. We are closer with this package, but we are still not close enough. I think that the reverse qualified majority is one of the issues at the core of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a time for populism and short-sighted policy-making, which, in my view, the Council has been doing to some extent sometimes. The Council, like Parliament, is responsible for Europeans. I hope that the Council, with the Commission and Parliament, will share their responsibility and take the necessary steps on this economic governance package and future actions. If the pieces are not right and not in order, plans for the future and the EU2020 are only futile and nice words, on which basis we really cannot build the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European economic governance package sends out a clear signal that we must avoid debt crises wherever possible in future. We must take effective measures to prevent the euro from being destabilised. That is the basic message of this excellent report produced by Mrs Wortmann-Kool. In order to achieve this, we need greater political coordination between the Member States and strong supervision at an EU level. This supervision is an essential element of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must finally make consistent use of the Stability and Growth Pact, which forms the basis for the strong euro, in order to show the Member States with high budget deficits where the limits are. This is what the citizens of Europe are justifiably calling for and not only in the countries which are supposed to be showing solidarity in the form of constantly growing rescue packages. We must not allow any more excuses or uneasy compromises to be made when the Member States disclose their convergence programmes and budget policies to one another. The citizens will only be prepared to accept painful reforms if they are shown a clear picture of the situation, so that they can give their support to the necessary measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">In contrast to the widely held belief in nationalism, we do not need less Europe, but more. For example, we should strengthen our Community method which is based on the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission must and will accept its responsibilities, identify trends in financial and economic policy at an early stage and ensure that the dialogue between the financial institutions and the policymakers is much more effective than it has been.</p>

      <p sl="en">And, particularly, I think that some have said that this is a transfer of powers from Member States to the European Union. This is the old hoary chestnut that is brought forward to object to every proposal. If you are part of the European Union it has to have some powers, and certainly we are sending out a message to the markets and the citizens that we can deal with crucial issues when they occur.</p>

It would be good to think that this package is no longer necessary and Europe’s economic problems will be solved overnight. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Europe is not over the crisis yet, and if we do not act responsibly, we will have to face further crises in the future. I agree with those responsible thinkers who say that we have to adopt a more stringent budget and have to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact. We have to say it out loud that the European Union has been taking an overly relaxed approach so far, it did not have mechanisms to react to crisis situations, and was therefore unable to respond adequately to the serious consequences of the crisis which caused economic, financial and social disturbances. We cannot let this happen again, and at the same time we have to learn from the failures of the past.</p>

It would therefore be a good thing if we were to improve the prevention of major deficits by moving decision-making further away from politics.

      <p sl="sk">The economic crisis has led many eurozone countries into serious debt problems, and it is clear that the rules of the stability pact did not protect the currency union from the results of amateurish and irresponsible management by the governments of some countries. Even though I do not think the European Commission should have more powers than it had previously, I agree that the European currency union must establish a more precise mutual control mechanism for budgetary policy. Some members of the currency union are paying for the irresponsibility or adventurism of others, and a move towards greater transparency and clearer budgetary rules leading to the avoidance of long-term problems in our countries has therefore become essential.

New rescue packages are being put together for Greece, billions of euros of taxpayers’ money is being put at risk and plans are being drawn up for economic governance for the whole of Europe, as we have just heard. The main aim of the Commission's proposals is to tighten up the regulations of the Stability and Growth Pact. In future, compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be enforced by imposing much tougher penalties. However, this pact has not worked in the past and I am assuming that it will not work in the future either. At the same time, one mechanism after another is being put in place to support the countries with budget deficits, once again involving taxpayers’ money. We are treating the symptoms rather than eliminating the causes. This highly risky strategy will come back to haunt Europe in the short or the long term.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not sure if I can respond to all of the Members. We would not have time for that, but I will try to provide some insights as regards the points made this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to, first of all, thank you all for a very substantial and substantive debate which reflects an overall sense of responsibility for Europe’s economic future, for growth and stability, and for our citizens’ welfare.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we all broadly share the view that balanced and healthy public finances are a necessary condition for sustainable growth and improving employment, which is the goal of the current legislative package. That is why it deserves your support. As many of you have underlined, it is an essential building block in our comprehensive policy response to the current and still ongoing financial and sovereign crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is it so important to adopt this package at the current juncture? Because we must be able to show our citizens, economic actors and the international partners that the European Union really can in future prevent a fiscal crisis such as the one we have recently experienced, in the case of Greece for instance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Never again. That is the first building block of this legislative package. That is why we need preventive budgetary surveillance and effective enforcement as proposed in the package and indeed by your rapporteurs and your committee. That is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning mechanism to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances, in order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen, for instance in Ireland or the credit boom we have seen in Spain.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we need the second building block in this package: an effective mechanism to identify and address macroeconomic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you, like Udo Bullmann, Sven Giegold and Philippe Lamberts, have asked whether we consider that the issue of symmetry/asymmetry has been settled. I can provide you with my interpretation and the Commission’s interpretation of this issue which in fact, if you look at the texts, is extremely complicated. I hope that nobody would block this package for the sake of that because it would be impossible simply to explain it to our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The drafts of both the Council and Parliament cover both the deficit and surplus countries. That is very clear. The differences in drafting would have no substantive impact on the scope or emphasis concerning the economic surveillance to be carried out. I hope that Parliament and the Council can work together and find an agreement that is based on the substance and not the semantics.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is practically no difference, so let us tick the box and conclude this important issue of symmetry/asymmetry so that we can start working in order to identify and also correct the macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness divergences.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, all in all, your vote tomorrow will be a very important one, a very crucial one for the European Union and its capacity to convince our general public, economic actors and international partners of our capacity to overcome the crisis and facilitate sustainable growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore your vote tomorrow will be a great opportunity to achieve a historic milestone of complementing the monetary union finally with a true and genuinely functioning economic union – which we definitely need – and thus enabling the European Union to come out of the current serious crisis with lessons learnt, hopefully also stronger for the future and, in any case, with new appropriate policy tools for sustainable growth, employment and for our citizens’ benefit.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am glad most of the contributions indicate that the job which was assigned to us – and by ‘us’ I mean Parliament and the Council – to agree on a very ambitious and new economic governance package, is 99% completed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also in agreement with many of the honourable Members that, after the hard work of negotiations, we have to get the deal done. I am optimistic because, here in this House, I feel a commitment and a real sense of ownership towards the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make a few comments on the particular issue – which is still open –of the extension of reverse qualified majority voting. During the last six or seven weeks, the Council has discussed Parliament’s proposals at least on a weekly basis. In the last four weeks the Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States discussed the package three times, and each time they made major concessions to Parliament on various points of the text in order to pave the way for a timely agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We discussed all aspects of all the proposals at various levels. Originally, you proposed that the reverse qualified majority voting rule be applied in more than 15 instances. In some cases it was not legally feasible to do so, and we identified where that was the case very quickly. Some of the other points in question were already included in the Council’s general approach to the decision on imposing financial sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In May, the Council agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in two places in addition to the general approach. On Monday the Council made large concessions, in the last case on the preventive arm of the Pact, including a review clause in three years’ time and the ‘comply or explain’ procedure, which was strengthened in comparison with the previous agreement in the March Ecofin Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">These safeguards can give Parliament the necessary reassurance that deviation from the Commission’s proposals and recommendations will be kept to a minimum and that cases of non-compliance with the rules, and thus the need for explanations, will be very rare exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is definitely time for Parliament to reconsider its initial position and to make a move towards the Council. The markets and investors are vigilant, and they would like to see whether we can deliver the agreement in the coming days or not. I believe it is essential for us to do so. In addition, this package could demonstrate how European institutions can cooperate in a responsible, efficient and constructive manner in such an important field. Several times during the trilogues, I heard serious criticisms from Members of Parliament about intergovernmental procedures. The swift and timely adoption of the package could prove that the Community method is the right approach to use in going forward.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I am grateful for everyone’s contributions to this debate, and particularly the summaries given by Commissioner Rehn and the President-in-Office of the Council, András Kármán. I would just like to stress one point: concessions have in fact been made on both sides, and I think we are very close to agreement, but I would not like them to fail to note the question of symmetry and asymmetry as an important issue that needs addressing. That and reverse qualified majority voting are points on which adjustments are still being made, and there is no conclusion on them yet. I am particularly grateful for Commissioner Rehn’s positive contribution but, if there is to be an agreement, it will have to be based on the legal text – on the articles section – including of course Article 32, Article 42 and recital 11-A, as has been widely debated. I would therefore be grateful if you would bear this issue in mind, because it is one that cuts across the interests of several Members of this House and several political groups, as you have seen.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Having said that, I think the new factor of the analysis of macroeconomic imbalances can be useful. I apologise, Commissioner, not only for detecting problems of bubbles in the property or financial markets, but also for pointing out the importance of Europe’s major problem: the tensions generated by the completely divergent ways in which the economies that make up the euro area evolve. Right now these tensions are seriously threatening the existence of a common currency with a non-optimal monetary area, as was very well highlighted today by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The fact is that the European Union is imperfect and incomplete. What we are doing is not enough to make up for the faults that the European economy has at the moment, and I think that the caricature of blaming everything on the mistakes of the lazy, the lying and the wrong – compared with the virtuous who have no problems – is an extremely dangerous caricature that we must all avoid. After all, the history of Europe proves that simple explanations for complex problems never give good results. That, then, is the appeal that I am making here.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I want to point out that this economic governance package brings greater transparency for the institutions and a better and larger role for Parliament. The package also forms part of the euro’s defences. Anyone who believes that the very best solutions for growth are not here must also admit that they do not know of any country that fails to grow if its public accounts are in order. Countries that show budgetary discipline are countries with economies that grow, and we must not forget that. That is the example that we must set here. That is the example that is being followed right now, for instance, in my country.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also want to put a question to all the Members of this Parliament: can you say that this economic governance package is worse today than when it arrived here? Can you say that no improvements have been made to it by this House? You cannot say that, because it is not true. This economic governance package today is better than the Commission’s initial proposal, and it is better because of the many contributions made by the Members of this House. That is why we have to give our citizens a very clear answer. We want a growing European economy. We want stability. We certainly want transparency. To achieve all that, however, we must show a sense of responsibility at voting time tomorrow; we must necessarily vote responsibly and choose our partners very well.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my thanks to everyone for this debate, to the Commissioner and to the Minister, Mr Kármán.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I wanted to say to the Minister that I think we have already proved that the Community method works well. As Diogo Feio just said, I think the text has actually been improved, and I think that when there is public debate we are doing our job and citizens can be informed about what is going on in Brussels, as they say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why is it, therefore, that we are still talking about the reversed qualified majority? I want to make a simple point. In this Parliament, there are countries for example with a larger population, who have more Members. When it comes to the votes, each country has a vote that matches its size. However, what democracy has a system whereby when it comes to applying the rule, we treat the people covered by the rule differently?</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to putting into practice rules that we have agreed on together, we cannot start making exceptions. Citizens expect the law to be applied equally to everyone. At the European level also, all Member States, whether big or small, should be in the same boat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why we are fighting: it is not an ideological battle, it is a matter of the general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point is about symmetry, and I am addressing Mrs Ferreira in particular. This is an important issue: it is part of the agreement. We must be aware that it has been very expensive for some of us, and to ensure we see it through until the end, we need as wide a unity as possible in this Parliament on all the aspects of the deal. We need to be united. As the Commissioner said, I think there are no differences between us so great that we cannot overcome them. I am appealing for unity, therefore. We cannot ask for support and at the same time leave others in hardship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for my last point, I wanted to thank Mr Kármán very specifically on the small point of ‘comply or explain’. I have asked you so many times during our discussions: what does that mean, ‘comply or explain’, and explain to whom? You have been a good lawyer; you have moved the Council along. They are ready to do it in public. They are planning ahead for economic dialogue. Thank you. Ask them to go a bit further still: this is all we ask.

      <p sl="nl">We have had quite an ideological debate today and it is clear that everyone in this House would like to have sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline, but history shows that you cannot achieve that by just spending more money.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We now have a package before us. We have achieved a great deal. Commissioner Rehn has 15 points on his list and it could be that there are some Members who have problems with the detail in this package, but if you look at the alternative offered by the Left, it leaves us even worse off. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, Members will be prepared to rise to the challenge of this very important legislative package for this Parliament, which for the first time in its history is exercising co-legislative powers, just as the Council does.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We will have to clear a few more hurdles next week, but hopefully we will have a positive outcome to the vote tomorrow. We therefore have one more week to go and I hope that we will ultimately be able to take a decision on first reading in July, because we are 98% there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On behalf of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would also like to emphasise what Mrs Goulard said about symmetry and asymmetry.

      <p sl="ro">At a time when the impact of the recession and public debt crisis is being strongly felt, we need robust economic governance at EU level. However, the economic governance legislative package would not, in its present form, help the European Union’s economy to recover, but would bring about a situation where high unemployment and poverty would be permanent fixtures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough, as they are only geared towards austerity and curtailing citizens’ social rights. There is no mention of elements which could underpin a European economic recovery, such as making investments in the key areas of infrastructure, education, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are able to propose an alternative to this austerity model which, as we can see from Greece, is proving to be extremely limited. The creation of bonds to be issued jointly for part of Europe’s public debt would automatically reduce the cost of financing in the European Union and would allow the resumption of investment. Following the New Deal policy model from the United States, the solution to the current economic and financial crisis will involve restoring economic growth based on investments and creating new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is important that the EU does not just respond to the crisis by eliminating the most acute problems, but that it also prepares more fundamental reform of economic governance. Many points in the submitted reports go in the right direction, but at the same time they have a number of deficiencies. The proposals talk about tougher sanctions, about fines for the non-fulfilment of recommendations and about these being applied automatically, in order to avoid succumbing to political horse-trading. This is all very well. I cannot rid myself of the feeling that the sanctions are tailored to those states that are currently in a difficult situation. They seem to be based on the idea that these states can deal with the difficult situation themselves, and that they are capable of improving their situation by themselves through a ‘disciplined’ approach. That is a mistake, however. Even before the crisis, a dynamic developed in Europe whereby the strong states of the eurozone cemented their competitive advantage. Thanks, among other things, to wage dumping in Germany, for example, the core countries strengthened their export position, and the peripheral countries became uncompetitive outlets for their products and capital. For these countries, the crisis was the last nail in the coffin. It is not possible to escape from this situation by willpower alone, or through one’s own decisions. The situation regarding macroeconomic imbalances, particularly in countries with the single currency, can be resolved only through a consensual reassessment of the current model of economic development.

      <p sl="fr">As usual, on the pretext of sorting out problems that you have caused yourselves, you are imposing on us more Europe and more Commission power: this Commission that is little more than a handful of civil servants appointed with no democratic oversight, but that has been set up as a censor and slave-driver that will have the right to impose sanctions on Member States. Your pseudo economic governance goes far beyond budgetary oversight. It is nothing short of imposing oversight on our peoples and nations. This is an application of the doctrine of limited sovereignty that was so close to the heart of that great democrat Brezhnev, except instead of tanks we have financial penalties. I am not exaggerating: one of these reports feels it necessary to state that in the event of a change in majority after an election, the new government must obtain authorisation before altering its predecessor’s budget priorities, and even then can only do so around the edges. As for the priorities themselves, they are those imposed by the European Union: repaying private creditors, reassuring the markets, dismantling social security and accelerating liberalisation at every turn, in keeping with the EU 2020 strategy. This is not correcting mistakes, improving public management or preventing another Greek situation: this is democracy held at gunpoint.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The crisis may provide us with an opportunity to change our rules and institutions, or to create new ones. The economist Joseph Schumpeter talked about ‘creative destruction’. At present, the EU therefore has a unique opportunity to establish a new mechanism that should lead to greater macroeconomic, fiscal and currency stability for the Member States in the long term, and help increase their competitiveness. The experience we have gained from the past operation of the Economic and Monetary Union has shown that such rules need to be enshrined in legislation, and that we cannot rely on the good will of individual Member States. For this reason, the submitted legislative package containing six proposals for establishing an improved framework for economic management is a step in the right direction. Four proposals relate to fiscal matters, including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, while the two new regulations try to identify and resolve macroeconomic imbalances emerging within the EU and the euro area. In order to enforce these new rules effectively, however, it is and it will continue to be advisable for both the national parliaments and the European Parliament to be involved in the whole process more closely and at an earlier point in time.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Overall, I believe that the legislative package which has been presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and the EU’s current economic situation, building on the relevant legislation and complying with the Europe 2020 strategy and other strategic EU documents, and therefore I recommend adopting it in the amended version.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The lack of suitable instruments for diagnosing public finance problems early, along with the poorly operating mechanisms of the Stability and Growth Pact, are among the basic causes of the long-running crisis which the euro area and EU are going through. This legislative package allows us to take appropriate measures to rectify the imbalances before they have an adverse impact on public finances. They will allow the European Commission to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the macroeconomic development of Member States and, if necessary, an in-depth analysis of national economies will be carried out. This is why the indicators for monitoring macroeconomic development and their thresholds must not be adopted automatically by the Commission, but must be analysed from an economic perspective. When the scoreboard is being produced, it is important that the different initial positions of the Member States are taken into consideration, along with their macroeconomic features, which differ for the countries in the euro area and the remaining countries in the EU. When analysing the indicators’ thresholds, consideration must be given to the catching-up process which new Member States are involved in. This is the only possible way of ensuring that an appropriate analysis of their macroeconomic development is carried out.</p>

      <p sl="en">The economic integration of the European Union and in particular the euro has reached a juncture at which one can no longer turn a blind eye to unequivocal deviations from the criteria that have been set in order to safeguard economic stability in the Union. Therefore, I would call for enhancing the role of the Commission with regard to the economic governance of the EU. Ultimately, automatic mechanisms ought to be established and executed when certain Member States consistently breach the Stability and Growth Pact. The economic crisis has exposed the irresponsible financial and economic decisions of several governments, but it is the conscientious Member States that are paying the price. The crisis has taught us a painful, but all the more valuable lesson for the future. The Commission ought to be mandated to intervene without prejudice whenever it receives alarming signals from any Member State and the Council should not back the culprits.

The sovereign public debt crisis shows that the current supervisory and remedial mechanisms are inadequate. The measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working, and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice. The debt criterion, as approved in the Treaty of Maastricht, is at last made operational in this new package and will now actually be applied. The institutionalisation of the European semester, the enhancement of the dialogue between the European institutions and national bodies, the role of Parliament and the Commission throughout the monitoring process, as well as greater and more effective supervision are all ways of achieving intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe. However, I must stress that the success of Europe’s economic policy must also depend on other, complementary measures to support investment and growth in the Member States. Europe must focus on a common strategy, but it must not forget the specific features of each country.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As the past year has shown, the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, which was intended to provide an effective deterrent against violations of the macroeconomic principles of the euro area by the Member States, has not been terribly effective, to put it mildly. This is due to a large extent to the fact that the Member States believed they could act with impunity, since the sanctions provided for by the system were not automatic. We are in agreement as to the form of sanctions which would be imposed on countries in the euro area which exceeded the permitted level of deficit and public debt. However, it is equally important to take preventive measures, and therefore we in the European Parliament are in favour of introducing an automatic mechanism in the preventive arm of the Pact as well. The entire process also requires greater transparency, and this can only be ensured by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</p>

Since economic governance regards public debt as equivalent to a deficit, we should make every effort to ensure that the medium-term budgetary framework which is put in place helps to reduce the burden on future generations. In doing so, we must use the experience gained during the first decade of functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Requirements pertaining to the rules and procedures that form the budgetary framework urgently need to be standardised, in order to ensure similar social protection benefits and to fight social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the high level of interdependence between the budgets of the Member States and the EU budget, budgetary forecasts at both levels should be characterised by the same degree of transparency.

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, we are dealing with a legislative proposal with which we will, for the first time, be introducing European standards for the handling of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Two years have passed since we adopted a directive on nuclear safety and since then increased attention has been paid to the safe operation of nuclear power plants.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European Parliament has also several times called for a directive on the management of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The events in Fukushima have shown that we were right to do so because spent nuclear fuel stored in a temporary pool may also present a risk which can be forestalled with appropriate measures. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) is very much in favour of the idea of a European directive, but we want it to be more rigorous in certain places. In our report, we have paid attention to the technological aspects, the provision of financial and human resources and independent, strong and competent regulatory bodies.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Let me give you a little more detail on our positions. Even the best ideas, much as they may be desirable, will not become reality if there is not enough finance. In the ITRE, we have essentially reinforced the finance requirements. For us, it is not enough for these resources to just be adequate and available. At the political level, we have to ensure that these two requirements are implemented and we therefore support greater transparency and supervision of financial resources. We are also introducing a requirement that the monies should be used for a specific purpose.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have also upheld the implementation of the polluter pays principle, and that I consider to be one of the key demands of the European Parliament. We have also responded to public concerns concerning the safety of disposed-of nuclear fuel and supported the principle of reversibility. We have taken the position that spent nuclear fuel must be controlled. However, for technical reasons or in case of new technological solutions, such fuel could be extracted, processed or recycled and reused.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have significantly tightened the transparency requirements and set out the details concerning public participation, the information which is to be given to the public and the method of communication and participation in procedures. In this context, we have referred to the Aarhus Convention. Our Committee is in favour of regional cooperation. However, in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve merely as an excuse to delay decisions, we have added a whole raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have paid particular attention to the protection of workers who handle spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, compliance with the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle which is established in practice, the need for education and training as well as the need for the development of scientific and technological skills.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would particularly like to emphasise our position on the export of radioactive waste. I dare say that not a single member of the Committee is a nimby (‘not in my backyard’). We are not in favour of irresponsible management and we want radioactive waste to be disposed of safely. On the other hand, we know that there are exceptions where export is allowed. We have therefore supported the amendment which allows exports to countries which operate the same standards that we will be introducing in the EU with this directive. For example, we should not be exporting radioactive waste to countries that have no final disposal facilities. We have also tabled an amendment in which we are demanding that the European Commission, once the peer reviews have been completed, evaluate the concept of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel management. Particular emphasis should be placed on the reversibility principle and the export requirements.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has only an advisory role under the Euratom Treaty. We have worked hard and I would like to think that our work will not be in vain. I therefore expect the European Commission and the Council to respect our positions and I ask that, during this debate, you support the positions adopted by ITRE.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, today we are discussing a Commission proposal on a subject that concerns Europe and that is on Parliament’s agenda for the second time. The Commission’s first proposal was not adopted in 2003 and 2004. We believe that it is sensible and advisable at a European level to apply the highest safety standards to the use of nuclear energy, regardless of the purpose for which it is being used, and to the management of nuclear waste.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mrs Jordan Cizelj for her comprehensive report and for her work over the last few weeks. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and from the other committees. My officials tell me that you have produced a highly factual and competent report. We are pleased that it supports the essential aspects of the Commission proposal, which is intended to be an important building block in the development of a comprehensive European legal and regulatory safety system at the highest possible level.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that you fundamentally agree with the concept of the European legal framework and that you support our proposals on the responsibility for the national programmes, on clear working, timing and financial requirements, on information and on the full involvement of the general public at an early stage in every national implementation process.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to work jointly to ensure that we have detailed and reliable proof of the waste management routes and their safety, particularly as the storage periods will be very long.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that many of the proposals that you have drawn up are well-informed. They support and strengthen the Commission’s approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make some additional remarks about four specific areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the basic principle is that we do not want to regulate every detail of the fundamental concept of subsidiarity. The starting position of all the Member States is different. We want to put in place a European legal framework. The essential points that are important for safety and for standards are included in the draft document. For example, we have left room for manoeuvre with regard to the type of public participation, the education and training of employees and managers and the details of the financial models – not the quality of the financing – and we are deliberately leaving open the regulation of the final storage facilities built and/or operated jointly by several Member States. Where necessary, we can make recommendations in this area, if we need to be more specific later in the process.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am sure that this proposal will not be the last to be submitted over the next 20 years. I expect that we will need to add to or amend the contents during the implementation process over the next two to five years. This is why the Commission is explicitly offering all of you the opportunity to revise the directive at the right time, so that we can learn from our experiences and improve the directive even further.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, if we look at the issue of the reversibility of the stored fuel elements and waste, the principle is that every storage facility must be suitable and safe for permanent final storage, from a geological and a technical perspective and as far as its construction is concerned. However, we are aware that there will be developments in the fields of research and science. At the moment, there are growing expectations that in the foreseeable future, over the next few decades, developments during the next or next-but-one generation of science will enable us to recycle or store waste more effectively than we can today. Therefore, we believe the option of reversibility and, in the meantime, of constant access and security to be equally important and we want to be able to incorporate this into national legislation and perhaps to make it clearer in the preamble.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we specifically support the rapporteur’s views on the importance of adequate financing for national waste management programmes. For this reason, the Commission proposal includes important requirements concerning financing which aim to ensure that we do not impose an excessive burden on future generations. Therefore, we want to guarantee that appropriate funding is made available at the right time and in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, that the national programmes include detailed and reliable cost forecasts and that the employees and the population as a whole are given information about all the issues relating to waste management. It is important that the financing is also transparent.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also support the proposals that the financing of waste management must be guaranteed over suitably long periods. We will submit these proposals to the Council on your behalf.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns exports. The basic principle of our proposal is that every Member State, regardless of how many, if any, nuclear power stations it has and what volume of waste it usually has to process, because every Member State has nuclear waste from medical devices and from industrial research, even if it has no power stations, must take responsibility for its own tasks and also enter into bilateral agreements and develop solutions with other Member States. In principle, exports to third countries are not in the interests of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my home country of Germany in the 1970s and 1980s, large amounts of hazardous waste were exported to the former German Democratic Republic and to Eastern Europe and stored there in return for payment in facilities which did not even come close to meeting the standards of the time and which did not provide the best possible protection for the environment and for the population. This is also a concern in this case. For this reason, we in the Commission are prepared to adopt every possible restrictive solution, including export bans and export restrictions. We want to call on Parliament not to support the opening up of this area, but to support a restrictive solution. This will make it easier for us to ensure that the Council does not water down the export restrictions at the end of the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank you very much for your constructive support today. I am sure that in a few years we will be discussing this subject again in Parliament with the aim of extending and improving this first directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let us hope that, when we come to review this directive, we can do it on a different legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our committee took the view that the legal basis should be Article 153 of the Treaty, as this matter directly concerns health and safety. We also underlined the importance of providing information and genuine consultation with workers concerning the safety case and safety assessments, not only of sites dealing with spent fuel and radioactive waste, but also as regards how these should be transported, and the need for a rigorous and effective inspection regime with sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also want to see that all licence holders ensure thorough and ongoing training of all involved in dealing with these substances, including subcontractors – potentially a weak link in the safety chain – casual workers and all others working on site, whatever their job.

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on the outcome of her work. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I was given an opportunity to experience first-hand how the technical proposal became a highly political subject overnight, and therefore I would also like to thank all of my fellow Members who succeeded in maintaining an objective approach, even in the face of pressure following the disaster in Japan. In particular, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for helping to ensure that the Committee’s opinion was of such high quality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that the Directive will establish a legal framework in the European Union for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and will form an integral part of EU legislation, ensuring the safe use of nuclear energy in those Member States which retain it in their energy mix. Among other things, I very much welcome the demand for Member States to secure sufficient funding for expenditure associated with the management of spent fuel. I myself have visited several radioactive waste storage facilities, and I firmly believe that a shortage of funding might directly lead to them becoming less safe, which is something we must prevent in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I welcome this report on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. It is the result of long debates, consultations and negotiations, and we will support it unanimously tomorrow. We have been using nuclear technology for energy production, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, and for powering submarines and icebreakers for 60 years. And over the past 60 years we have failed to find efficient solutions for the management and long-term storage of hazardous waste. We support this directive, even if we do not agree with every element of it, because it reduces political obstacles and establishes the necessary financial conditions and independence. Although we have different opinions about energy production, we all agree, based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, that the waste produced in the European Union has to be stored within the EU, even if reprocessing takes place in a third country. We support the initiative to reduce waste to a minimum, and, if research and development results make it possible, to perform further recycling, because the principle of reversibility is very important for us.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also consider it extremely important to keep in mind the human factor. It is imperative that we guarantee the human factor, and the safety of employees is closely connected to this and has to be a priority during waste storage. However, we also consider it important to mention that the current legal basis does not provide sufficient European solutions, because we do not have co-decision rights. This is why we believe it is important to find a new legal basis in the future. Finally, Europe has to be a leader as regards both regulations and the construction of storage facilities. Only this way can we set an example to the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, nuclear waste is a problem we just have to deal with. Even if all nuclear reactors were shut down tomorrow, there would still be a legacy of waste from half a century of nuclear generation and from a variety of other activities. Since we cannot just wish it out of existence, we need to deal with nuclear waste in the most responsible way possible. That means making sure that radioactive waste remains under EU control and scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once nuclear waste is outside European borders, we cannot guarantee how it is managed. For that reason, the ALDE Group strongly supports the Commissioner’s position and insists on maintaining the status quo. The export of radioactive waste to third countries must be banned.</p>
      <p sl="de">A particular problem with nuclear waste is the sheer timescale of the danger that it poses. Ten thousand years ago we were living in caves. How can we possibly know what human society and Planet Earth will look like ten thousand years from now?</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason we have to future-proof the decisions that we take today. At the moment the geological storage of nuclear waste may very generally seem to be the least worst option, but advances in science could potentially turn that conclusion on its head. I therefore welcome the Commissioner’s remarks on this. For that reason, including the revision clause in this directive is common sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I have to point out, as a number of colleagues before me have done, just how absurd it is that the European Parliament is merely consulted and has no real say on this directive, upon which the safety of so many future generations depends.</p>

      <p sl="cs">After many debates, we have succeeded in maintaining a rational approach to our management of radioactive waste. It goes without saying that we should endeavour to ensure maximum safety in the management of radioactive waste, and the report therefore emphasises the duty to inform and to be open about these activities, in such a way as to increase public confidence. All of these activities must be subject to strict controls in compliance with international standards. It is important to provide storage in both interim storage facilities and long-term repositories in accordance with these standards. These are extremely costly activities, involving facilities that will operate for decades, if not centuries. Further technological developments in future decades should therefore be taken into consideration. Repository technology must allow a certain amount of future flexibility. In my opinion, it is unwise to attempt the absolute containment of nuclear waste in permanent repositories.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, while the European Union is trying to find a solution for the storage and disposal of so-called spent fuel, in the United States and Russia these are considered as economically sound sources of energy. Spent fuel generated by nuclear plants today can easily be used as fuel in fourth-generation molten-salt reactors. The application of the proton accelerator method using a lead-bismuth target opens up even greater possibilities. Long-lived high-level radioactive isotopes generated by nuclear plants are basically non-hazardous: they could be transmuted into short-lived low level isotopes, while enabling the facility to function as an electricity-producing power plant. The fact that these reactors are also capable of being powered by thorium, and our stocks of this material are 10 times higher than those of uranium, is another advantage. These reactors are powered by a fraction of the critical mass of fissile material, which means that the occurrence of a spontaneous nuclear chain reaction is impossible. Unless we start to introduce and apply the new technology immediately, we will fall behind the leading edge of research and development and economy once more.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the nuclear power debate often separates us into different camps. We are for or against, we want a quick decommissioning and phasing out or no phasing out at all. However, when it comes to nuclear safety, the position that we are all starting from is quite different. In this case, we agree that we want the highest possible level of safety, and that of course also applies to the nuclear waste that we will be responsible for, irrespective of how long we continue to use nuclear power – and so will many, many generations after us. The waste must be dealt with in the absolutely best way possible and the EU directive must be structured so that it genuinely meets these objectives. One issue that is particularly important is that of the export of nuclear waste that several speakers have already mentioned. It must be possible for EU Member States to continue to enter into agreements among themselves regarding the waste, but we must not export it to countries outside the EU. That is a moral imperative, and we must fulfil it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, any country that is not in control of how to process its own waste should not be allowed to use the technology that has produced the waste. No country should become another country’s dustbin. This is why we must support the Commission’s position on exporting waste and the ban, and why we must be extremely strict on any bilateral agreements that may be entered into.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, nuclear waste should be governed by common law, but with stricter rules. The definition that has been put to us is less than a minimum standard. In reality, it does not actually define waste, since if we take it to its logical conclusion, there will never be nuclear waste because we will always be able to think up a new technological solution. I find this irresponsible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the cost of dismantling and the cost of waste disposal should be properly incorporated into the price of nuclear energy, which unfortunately is not the case at present. We cannot try to apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle if we are not going to be completely strict and responsible in the way we control prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the recent events in Japan certainly reminded us of the potential problems associated with harnessing nuclear energy and disposing of spent fuel. However, in a world challenged by energy shortages, we need to remain open-minded.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must try to encourage all forms of energy production – from renewable, sustainable energies to investing in safe nuclear plants. When dealing with nuclear energy, safety and the transparency of procedures are two important issues which need to be constantly attended to. The answer is not necessarily to shut down plants, as Germany is planning to do, but rather to ensure that we are following the strictest safety programmes when it comes to dealing with this form of energy and the waste it produces.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Oettinger. He is now the third commissioner who is responsible for the area of nuclear safety, waste and decommissioning. Parliament has always supported the Commission and has always called for the authority in this area to be moved to a European level. Unfortunately, the Council’s nuclear working group did not believe that these were issues which had a place on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am proud of the fact that we are slowly succeeding in having serious discussions with one another on these subjects and that the Council is making a genuine effort to highlight the European added value and, on the other hand, to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity. However, I believe this is also simply about realising what we can achieve in this highly sensitive area in the Eighth Framework Programme for Research. This is why the scientific side and the question of what we assume will come from harmonisation in future and of whether we want to see mutual recognition are particularly important in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we should also think about the subjects that we want to focus on in the immediate future. I remember well that Mrs Palacio once said that the issue would only appear on the agenda again when the next nuclear disaster happened. Unfortunately, she was right. It is rather late to be considering this, but it is high time that we thought about the measures that need to be taken at a European level. However, that is not enough. Europe must play a pioneering role, in particular in the international arena. We should be establishing standards in this area together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We need standards which quite simply guarantee the highest possible level of safety and which ultimately give us the opportunity to avoid putting the population at risk as far as possible. Mr Oettinger, I would like to congratulate you. You have taken the right approach and we can be sure that Parliament and the Commission will be highly successful.</p>

As there seems to be a broad consensus on this issue, I hope that there will also be agreement when it comes to the vote tomorrow and that we can support the Commission. It would certainly be very sensible for the Commission and the European Parliament to take a joint approach in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, on the issue of public participation, you said, Mr Oettinger, that we do not need detailed regulations in this area. In principle, you are right. However, we will also need public participation across national borders. As we have storage facilities which are close to borders, we cannot simply say that this is where the border is and the issue has nothing to do with the other citizens. We will probably need common rules in this area, otherwise there may be disputes or people may be excluded and told that the matter does not concern them because they are citizens of another state. However, we are all citizens of Europe. As some countries are affected by storage sites of this kind which are close to their borders, it is important for us to establish certain principles and for the Commission to propose some fundamental regulations, so that public participation is taken seriously and is based on common principles.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Romana Cizelj for her fine report, which I sincerely hope will allow us to move closer towards adopting the subsequent directive on radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Europe definitely needs rules and a legal framework for establishing mandatory requirements for ensuring the highest possible level of safety, which both we and Europe’s citizens want so much. However, establishing such safety solely within Europe is no great achievement. On the contrary, if activities involving nuclear energy are carried out in proximity to the European Union’s borders according to rules and standards which are lower than those in Europe, this is already a cause for concern for us and Europe’s citizens. The reason for this is that nuclear incidents do not respect geographical borders.</p>
      <p sl="bg">How can we spread the application of high European standards to other countries? The only really practical means of doing this is through cooperation with such countries and running joint projects. This is why I think that it is very important to implement the first amendment tabled in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which allows the possibility of exporting spent fuel and radioactive waste to third countries, if standards are applied in these countries which are as high as ours. Refusing Member States this practical opportunity deprives them of the most effective means of disseminating our high European requirements. By this I mean cooperation and joint radioactive waste treatment projects. Let us put aside the moral doubts that the European nuclear industry will take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of unsuitable waste at other countries’ expense. This is not seriously going to happen. I strongly urge the Commission to adopt a more constructive stance on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, you have talked about three things for which I believe you will be able to count on the support of a large majority in this House. You have talked about support for the export ban. You will in any case receive support from a great many of us, because this concerns our own waste. We have to take care of it ourselves and we should not be exporting waste to other countries outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You are calling for transparency. Nobody is against transparency. It seems like a very good idea, certainly given the fact that the issues of nuclear energy and radioactive waste get so many people stirred up.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You have also talked about the final solution for underground storage being reversible. You said, ‘This is not a permanent solution, we will always have access to the waste’. I approve. In that regard, you have my unqualified support.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do have one concern, however, and that is underground storage. Are you definitely sure this is the safest method? To my mind, it is not. Nor is it one that is used anywhere else. In some countries, the landscape is not really suitable for the storage of radioactive waste, so I would argue that we should be given a realistic option for dealing with waste in another safe alternative above the ground.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every Member State produces radioactive waste. This is why we should not only take care of the spent fuel of the power plants with a view to protecting the environment and citizens’ health, but also ensure safe and efficient management of radioactive waste in general. For that reason alone it is indeed appropriate to discuss this issue here, in the European Parliament today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree that the utilisation of nuclear power belongs to national sovereignty. However, the establishment of basic EU principles related to national waste management regulations is justified. In the absence of such principles and as a result of divergent regulations, market players are interested in managing their radioactive waste in countries with the most permissive regulations. This is why the initiative to make Member States establish binding waste management programmes is promising. One of its prerequisites, however, is to appoint competent authorities who can provide a strict control of nuclear waste management activities and can penalise violations in an appropriate manner, if necessary. I believe that national programmes must also clarify the competence of such authorities and the responsibility of market players.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to conclude with one final remark: full-scale management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is a very costly activity. This means that national programmes are useless unless financing issues are clarified. Setting aside the financial resources required for nuclear waste management as early as in the course of nuclear waste production is an important basic principle. I agree that those who produced the waste have to bear the costs of waste management. This will provide an appropriate incentive for market players to reduce radioactive waste quantities and manage them efficiently.</p>

Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and, above all, the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a fair one. The second issue concerns safety, and the health and safety of workers in particular. This is a point that I consider extremely important, and we have to give people peace of mind.

      <p sl="ro">There are currently three power stations in the European Union in the process of decommissioning, supported by European financial contributions. Germany has already announced that it is going to halt operations at a number of power stations. In the near future, there will be other power stations in other Member States which will need to be halted because they are reaching the end of their operational life. The directive’s approach at national level will result in the creation of radioactive landfills across the whole of the European Union. This is a waste of resources and a source of concern for the general public. This is the case at the moment in Romania, even in the region I come from, with regard to the radioactive landfill from the Kozloduy power station.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that a truly European, long-term approach is required, which will result in using shared technology, saving resources and European funding mechanisms.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the issue of spent fuel and radioactive waste management is an important and pressing area, which has received even greater attention since the disaster at Fukushima. Despite technological innovations and solutions and waste management programmes, the problem represents a greater challenge every day. The management and final disposal of radioactive waste is an existing problem, and will continue to exist in the future. In Europe we aim for energy security and environmentally friendly, stable energy production. However, we also need to pay increasing attention to several issues, for instance the processing, transmutation and final disposal of rapidly expanding quantities of radioactive waste. Not only do we need to create the technical facilities for this, but also build a strict political, legal and social structure. It would be worth considering, assessing and planning pan-European cooperation in this field. All responsible participants should be involved in the building and development of this safe process. We need to take measures that will also protect future generations.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is good that the submitted directive emphasises better quality supervision and controls, but especially the greater transparency of these processes and public participation. In my opinion, securing sufficient earmarked funds to cover the inevitable costs for decommissioning nuclear reactors and managing the resulting radioactive waste remains an important open question. The proposed system for monitoring the level of financial reserves through an independent body can, with the right organisation, create the conditions for a nuclear facility to accumulate during its operating life sufficient funds to finance environmentally-friendly decommissioning, and that should be our objective.</p>

I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies. The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people’s health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.</p>

It is important that the Union will implement a Directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. Romania is among those Member States which are in favour of having the possibility to export radioactive waste to third countries. Spent fuel from research reactors in Romania needs to be either repatriated to the country of origin, Russia or the United States or exported to third countries in special cases. For this reason I cannot support the export ban proposal in this report. As nuclear energy will remain part of the Member States’ energy mix in the future it is important that such a report is adopted successfully in the plenary session of this Parliament.

      <p sl="hu">Radioactive waste is produced all over the European Union, including isotopes used for medical, industrial, agricultural, research or even educational purposes. Still, spent fuel is most frequently produced in nuclear plants. Two technologies are currently applied for the treatment of such waste: either recycling, or final disposal. Waste is classified into three types based on its radioactivity: low-level, intermediate-level and high-4level waste. This classification also determines whether it will undergo near-surface or deep geological disposal. The final responsibility for spent fuel and radioactive waste lies with the Member States. However, most Member States have still not taken their most important decisions concerning spent fuel. Unfortunately, few places operate well-organised final disposal programmes for nuclear waste. We need to make a continuous political commitment to long-term spent fuel and radioactive waste management in a way that enables it to be implemented under the highest level of safety regulations. Member States must adopt high-level national regulations on nuclear safety for the protection of citizens. Furthermore, they have to establish a system which determines the competence and responsibility of national authorities in respect of nuclear waste management. Public information has to be provided as well, because it is very important that the public has appropriate knowledge of the events taking place around them.</p>

Political perversion means nothing but lies and cynical deception of voters. It appears that in Latvia, there has appeared a group of members of parliament who are political perverts. The issue is that during the last elections to the Latvian parliament, members of the Saskaņas centrs (Harmony Centre) group promised their Russian-speaking constituents, who in Latvia comprise more than 40% of the population, that they would protect their native language.

It turns out that they promise one thing, and do another. I believe you will agree that that is perversion. It is possible that Latvia will become the birthplace of a new political movement, the ‘Perversion Centre’. Thank you for your attention.</p>

Seventeen captains in Europe, plus as many mates, seventeen budgets, seventeen bond markets and one common currency. The common currency cannot go on like this. We need a common economic policy, a single bond market and joint coordination. Without doubt, fiscal prudence implies a shake-up in the consumer climate. I do not see anything happening in that direction. We need to safeguard the major achievements of the last 65 years, culminating in the single currency, by being more disciplined with ourselves.</p>

Downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the low production costs and low social, environmental and quality standards in third countries, which cannot be compared with the standards in the EU. When new trading relationships are established, it is essential for us to protect European production levels by including safeguard clauses. Clauses of this kind which are used in an industrial context, for example in trade agreements with South Korea concerning the car industry, must also be applied to agriculture.</p>

Journalists die in Russia, and journalists investigating political issues die even more frequently.

The Venice Commission has emphasised the individual nature of human rights, as the framework agreement for the protection of ethnic minorities does not assume any collective minority rights.

The European Commission, unfortunately, says it can, given that it and Portugal have jointly endorsed a term on reduced guaranteed prices for energy from renewable sources as a lawful measure in the memorandum on the support mechanism. In Greece, investments in renewable energy are one of the few counterweights to the economic crisis and the commitment by the outgoing Minister for Environmental Affairs to safeguard guaranteed prices needs to be renewed immediately by her successor.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the debate on a possible exemption for countries with economic problems from the already inadequate European climate targets, the 20-20-20 targets, is a serious absurdity. These choices illustrate an unacceptable attitude endorsed by the Commission; they set entire European policies in stone and no one anywhere is held to account. All Europe will achieve with this is to cut the branch it is sitting on.</p>

It is important to highlight this, because today some Romanian politicians explain the necessity of administrative reorganisation by claiming that this is the only way Romania can receive more money from the Structural Funds. The current debate in Romania is about a reform that would create eight NUTS 2 level administrative units from the current 41 counties that are NUTS 3 administrative units, while ignoring geographical, economic, social and cultural realities. The main debates concern the Romanian Hungarians in particular, because this native national community, despite the provisions enshrined in the relevant convention of the Council of Europe, would not represent a majority in any of the new administrative units and would lose its rights to set up a local government. The EU has to ensure that Member States not only expect the EU itself to observe the principle of subsidiarity, but that they, too, ensure that decision making takes place as close to the citizens as possible.</p>

In Poland, unfortunately, a witch-hunt is being conducted against the opposition, and the courts have joined in. In the case involving the former prime minister and leader of the opposition, Jarosław Kaczyński, a court has ordered that he undergo psychiatric tests. This is especially mean in view of the fact that the only reason for ordering him to undergo such tests was that he admitted that he had used sedatives after the Smolensk tragedy, in which his brother, sister-in-law and many of his friends died.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, if Members look at their e-mails and all the requests from lobbyists and industry, and the pros and cons on the climate, they can conclude that climate is very clearly back on the political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is a very good thing, because climate has never been off the scientific agenda. If you look at how science has been evolving meanwhile, the arguments for stronger climate policies have become stronger and stronger every day. However, in the political field, it was rather quiet on the climate front after Copenhagen and Cancún. Now it is clearly back on the political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is a good thing. However, what is very important is that in the meantime it has become a different debate. It is not only a climate argument any more. It has become more and more an economic debate, an economic argument. If you look at the new industries relying on climate policies, they are asking for more ambitious climate policies. Or look at our oil dependency and the situation in northern Africa: the debate on oil dependency is becoming more and more important for our economic position in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">But look too at all the letters from industry, really lobbying for going to 30% because it is in their interest; it helps their profits if we step up our climate ambitions. This very clearly indicates that there is a fundamental shift in the debate on climate policies. That is very important. It is not the economy versus ecology; it is the economy and ecology. That is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what is in the report? Of course, we are asking the Commission to come forward with a proposal to move to 25% reduction domestically. This is very important, because that is the way to become less dependent on oil; that is the way to harvest the health co-benefits; that is also the way to really harvest the potential of energy savings. So energy savings are also a crucial part of the report because, if we meet our energy savings targets, we are already on the path of achieving 25% domestically in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the report, we are asking for 30% overall; so 25% domestically, but 30% as a whole. There are a lot of offsets still in the market, so if you have 25% domestically, we are discussing 30% as a whole as well. That also limits somewhat the role of offsetting, which has also been part of the debate; that is also in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is also a discussion on the adjustment of the emissions trading system. Let me be very clear. If we are stepping up climate ambitions through energy savings and we only do something relating to energy savings, the carbon price will go down; studies estimate from EUR 15 to EUR 0 per tonne carbon. So we also need to do something in the ETS system to make sure we have the right price and really have the incentives to move to green technologies.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is going to be a crucial vote tomorrow for a future economy, a green economy. I urge the Commission to follow up the request we will make as a Parliament tomorrow by coming forward with a legislative proposal. The Council is moving, Parliament will set out its position tomorrow, and then it is up to the Commission to come forward with a proposal. We know when we are discussing a legislative proposal that in the Council there will be no veto for any country any more.</p>

There is no scientific basis to prove that humans have a decisive role to play in increased atmospheric CO2 emissions. The climate is affected by cycles lasting several centuries. Researchers such as Professor Jaworowski, an outstanding climate researcher from Poland, have issued expert opinions on these issues.</p>

The answer is that it once was a green island, but the climate changed, independently of human activities.

Therefore, the level of 20% which we have currently set ourselves is very high.

Gas and coal will play an important role in replacing nuclear energy.

      <p sl="sk">At the same time, the Committee’s opinion draws attention to the fact that the current reduction in the output of emissions in Europe cannot be interpreted as a signal that the EU is on the way to achieving the goal of reduced emissions. It should rather be understood as the result of reduced industrial output and the relocation of production away from Europe, as a result of which unemployment is growing in Europe. I therefore firmly believe that the way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to promote the innovation of new green technologies more consistently, so that we address the need to protect air quality not just through administrative and financial instruments, but rather through support for research and the implementation of new technologies in real life.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Europe’s energy and climate strategy must combine economic competitiveness with energy security and environmental concerns. The purpose of going beyond the 20% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be to reconcile these objectives. I agree with stepping up reduction efforts from 20% to 25%, in which the extra 5% corresponds to an increase in energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential, however, to find solutions that maintain the competitiveness of European industry. In that respect, I welcome the fact that for the first time there is a broad consensus in Parliament for the inclusion of a sectoral approach. This approach will make the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set for a particular country compatible with the holistic, global treatment of each industrial sector, thus preventing carbon leakage.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the public expects us, as politicians, to be pragmatic, rational and efficient in all of our actions. Taxpayers can forgive us many things, but they will not forgive us if we spend their money and have nothing to show for it. When we discuss global warming, we should approach it as a rational project. Let us leave aside for a moment issues relating to the legitimacy or otherwise of this theory, which formed the basis of our political decisions on this issue. We are aware that the science is disputed, but we do not wish to resolve this dispute here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should however like to highlight the fact that a characteristic feature of greenhouse gases is that they know no borders. Even if the European Union adopts the tightest possible limits on greenhouse gas emissions, the outcome will be the same if China, India and other developing countries do not also adopt such limits at the same time. In addition to the fact that European taxpayers’ pockets will be hit, unemployment will rise if production is limited, and jobs will move outside the borders of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the above, let us act rationally if we are to act at all on this matter, so that this is a global process, for only then will it be effective. If it is true that a month’s worth of greenhouse gas emissions in China corresponds to an annual 20% decrease in Europe, then this says a lot.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Eickhout for drafting this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I regard the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe as vital, based on the conclusions from the Cancun Summit. This means that the EU must retain its role as global leader in the area of environmental protection. This is why it needs to reform the implementation of its green policy. I should emphasise how important it is to review the mechanisms for monitoring emissions and the need to take them into account within the entire budget.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It would also be useful to improve the EU’s current emissions trading scheme. With this in mind, a recommendation has been made to extend this system’s scope of application to facilities outside the industrial sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, Mrs Hedegaard wants me to pass on her greetings to you. She has been unavoidably detained this evening and she has asked me to make a few important points on her behalf and on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Parliament, all its Members and the rapporteur for this significant and far-reaching report.</p>
      <p sl="de">We continue to attach great importance to the target of limiting global warming to 2°C. For this reason, we have put in place short- and medium-term targets for 2020 and a long-term strategy for 2050. It is clear that we must also analyse the interim stages on the timeline between 2020 and 2050 and define additional interim targets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last year the EU established the goal of 20% covering the period of the next nine years. This was done almost a year ago in Parliament and before that in the Commission and the Council. Of course, in the light of the technical possibilities, the economic effects and the financial changes, there are arguments in favour of higher targets. However, we only put the target of 20% in place just under a year ago. I do not believe that the information which we based our decision on has changed since then. We have said that Europe will reduce emissions by 30% if other important regions of the world are prepared to make binding agreements, because the climate is a global issue. We believe that there are still opportunities to introduce binding agreements or partial agreements. For this reason, the conditions are 20% for Europe alone and 30% if we have partners, in other words, the US or China. I believe that this is a serious, far-reaching and fair offer.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the last year, the Commission discussed and adopted a communication which highlights the options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20% in line with the conclusions, in other words, a reduction of 30%. It also considers whether this target is technically and economically feasible and whether it will have an impact on costs, although we assume that the costs will be lower than previous estimates indicated. We believe that the principle of reliable planning should currently be given priority. This means that industry, the economy and private citizens have the security to plan ahead on the basis of the targets which were adopted last year with a democratic majority of 20% stand-alone and 30% when other relevant partners are prepared to enter into binding agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">A sort of automatic mechanism was used to show that if energy efficiency was added to the 20% reduction in CO2 emissions then 25% would automatically be possible. However, I would like to remind you that at the same time and on the basis of the same information Parliament has been discussing 20, 20, 20 for some years. No mention has been made of the last 20% automatically turning the second 20% into 25% simply because it was adopted later and is now being addressed by the Commission. That would not be in the spirit of the inventor. This was never referred to in speeches in 2007 or 2009. It is a new idea which is open to discussion. However, I do not agree with the automatic mechanism. If we in the Commission and in the European Union had taken energy efficiency more seriously at an earlier stage, the question of the automatic mechanism would probably not have arisen.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then there is the question of balancing the interests of the economy and the environment. I believe that innovation, in particular in the area of the environment, offers significant opportunities for engineers and technicians, for adding value in a variety of ways and, therefore, for creating jobs. We must aim to ensure that these new jobs in the field of energy and climate are created in Europe. On the other hand, we must make sure that we do not lose any essential jobs. What do I mean by that? I mean that the world should not produce more aluminium and steel than it needs. However, the quantity of steel, aluminium and copper needed in Europe and in the rest of the world should, as far as possible, be manufactured here in Europe, at least if it is currently produced here. It is acceptable to relocate or avoid the production of steel, aluminium and copper wherever it is possible to do so. However, the quantity of steel, aluminium and copper needed in Europe and in the rest of the world should, if possible, be manufactured in Europe, in competition with other locations. We believe it would be wrong to move production deliberately.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, when balancing these interests, we must continue in future to consider whether higher CO2 emission reduction targets are feasible, whether they will help to retain jobs in ‘old industries’ and whether we can prevent these jobs from being moved elsewhere. One thing is clear. I would prefer jobs in the steel industry and steel production to remain in Europe with a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, rather than see them move to Brazil, Malaysia or America, where the CO2 emissions levels would be 100%. Then we would have put our money on the wrong solution. It is better to have a 20% reduction in emissions and to retain the jobs, the added value and the tax revenues than to lose the jobs, to have a clear conscience in Europe and to have 100% emissions in America and Asia with the jobs and the tax revenues going to these areas. This is a very pragmatic approach that nevertheless takes the environment and the economy into consideration. You are calling on the Commission to make more far-reaching proposals in individual areas. We will be happy to meet your demands. We are relying on the fact that progress will be made by other governments throughout the world during other global conferences and also after the elections in the US in the late autumn of this year.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I want to encourage Parliament to continue to support us with its expert contributions and to make the appropriate demands on us. We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and we want to ensure by means of controls and transparency that we achieve the target of 20% and that nothing goes wrong in Europe. In the autumn we will be presenting to you our thoughts on the revision of the emissions trading system (ETS). We will be submitting a report, as we promised today in the proposal on energy efficiency, about whether the increase in efficiency will lead to a significant change in the market for CO2. If necessary, we will have to investigate whether there will be shortages, to ensure that emissions trading remains an effective instrument for reducing CO2 emissions within the market economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">I take this opportunity to express my opposition to a unilateral increase in the European target for greenhouse gas emission reductions to beyond 20% by 2020, given the lack of a global climate agreement involving all the major emitters. It should not be forgotten, in fact, that the European Union is still the only area in the world to have adopted legally binding emission reduction targets. The immediate consequence of that is that European industry is exposed to strong competition from global competitors that are not bound by the same constraints. In my opinion, therefore, the Union’s priority should first of all be to achieve the 20-20-20 targets set by the Climate and Energy Package, which are already very ambitious. That is the only way we can define an environmental policy for the Union that enables European businesses to remain competitive at global level in order to sustain economic growth and especially job creation. In conclusion, I share the concerns expressed by Italian industry representatives that industry is currently not in a position to sign up to more ambitious commitments than those already established by the European Council and confirmed by the Commission in the Emissions Trading Directive.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Commission Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 suggests that achieving the 20% energy efficiency target would automatically lead to a 25% reduction in emissions, without any change to the current legislative framework. Without an international agreement, unilaterally raising the emissions reduction target could threaten the competitiveness of our industry as well as growth and jobs in the European Union. We should instead go down the road of energy savings and renewable energy. In this respect I support Commissioner Oettinger on the new energy efficiency proposal, which will certainly bring about savings for individuals and businesses by helping them manage their own consumption. Moreover, in discussing the EU’s future climate policies, we cannot leave out of the equation the new European and international energy scenario that has emerged following the uprisings in North Africa and the nuclear crisis. These factors will have a significant impact on energy costs in the medium term, and we will need to assess their repercussions on Europe’s current environmental strategy. Suffice it to say that abandoning nuclear power will force Germany to use more fossil fuels, thus raising its greenhouse gas emission levels. We must therefore reorient our environmental policies to create much-needed convergence with our energy policies, leaving traditional sectoral approaches behind.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The economies of certain EU Member States, including that of my own country, Poland, are already suffering the harmful effects of the arbitrarily imposed climate and energy package, used as a tool to implement the political objective of 3 x 20. However this political objective is often misrepresented as well: people talk about a 20% drop in energy consumption, yet the actual objective is a 20% increase in energy efficiency, which is not the same thing. The term ‘efficiency’ is often used incorrectly in EU documents, due to a misunderstanding of the term ‘energy efficiency’ and methods for its assessment, or in other words whether we are talking about national gross efficiency or efficiency per capita, or conversion efficiency, for example the conversion of primary energy into useful work. An emphasis on increasing efficiency, instead of on limiting consumption, will result in technological innovations being prioritised, which will be to our advantage. Such innovations hold the greatest potential for limiting emissions, by even more than the target of 20%.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Member States should have the right to make their own choices in respect of methods and timetables for limiting emissions, mainly through increased efficiency. In the case of Poland, this relates mainly to the enormous potential represented firstly by the wholesale improvement of new and old buildings in terms of thermal efficiency, and secondly by the widespread replacement of old thermal power plants in residential buildings with modern thermal electric power plants. The climate and energy package needs to be revised in order to ensure that the Member States are better adapted to reducing emissions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Climate change presents the international community with a serious challenge. The results which have been presented show that Europe is pursuing an effective climate policy. It would be wrong for the EU to set new unilateral targets, in view of the fact there are no regulations at global level containing binding reduction targets. Poland is alarmed at the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Eickhout, which covers many issues which could pose a threat to the European economy. Imposing a further reduction in emissions from 20% to 30% may cause a great deal of damage as far as climate change is concerned. If production costs in Europe are too high, the global quantity of emissions will rise, due to increased imports of products from countries with low efficiency in terms of emissions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">European industry has shown that we can count on its commitment to searching for innovative solutions which will help in the fight against climate change. Groundbreaking achievements are only possible on the basis of well-planned long-term investments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the very high level of coal usage in Poland’s energy sector, as of 2013 Polish industry will be forced to bear significantly higher costs than its European competitors, due to the ETS. This may give rise to huge problems in terms of accomplishing the original reduction target at the same time as maintaining financial liquidity. Raising the reduction target by a further 5% or 10% will cause many Polish companies to collapse, and we cannot allow this to happen.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In its original form, the report shows an enormous amount of amateurish enthusiasm and a somewhat unrealistic attempt to ignore the reality of electricity supplies today, as well as presenting a catalogue of wishful thinking. It is likely that all EU citizens will applaud the bold plans for emissions reductions of 80-95% by 2050. Yet when we get down to details, the plan as it currently stands ought to be based on the fully realistic opportunities offered by current energy resources. It is impossible to eliminate the use of coal and natural gas from one day to the next, and incidentally there has been a marked increase in the use of natural gas in recent years in EU Member States. In connection with the hysteria which broke out after the earthquake in Japan and the problems concerning the reactor at the Fukushima power plant, the citizens of certain EU Member States decided to move away from nuclear energy within a relatively short space of time, although there are still no signs of any generalised problem. In concrete terms, we can see that the EU does not have any transmission lines that could transmit a sufficient quantity of electricity from north to south or east to west. It is widely known that the wind does not blow all the time, even in North Germany, and solar cells, which currently have an efficiency of around 11%, can only convert the solar energy which falls on them into electrical current. The output of solar power stations thus fluctuates considerably over the course of a day and during the year. I support the conclusions of the report by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, but they must necessarily be followed up a detailed analysis of the plans.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European Climate and Energy Policy is characterised by an abundance of irrational solutions. It created emissions trading, which artificially raises the price of electricity and pushes up costs, with barely any benefit to the climate or the environment. It established wind power in places where it is not windy. Feed-in tariffs have made profitable what should never really be profitable. Income has been redistributed away from industry to companies that produce electricity for the stock exchange. Renewable energy targets have been set within such an unrealistic timeframe that it endangers sustainable forestry. We can no longer afford such things, now that the global economy is in crisis and the euro’s credibility is at stake. In the light of all this, I cannot understand Parliament’s eagerness to increase our unilateral targets for cutting emissions, the global environmental benefits of which will be minimal compared to the burden it will put on our industry and jobs. As Germany has now said that it is abandoning nuclear power, it is obvious that the EU will not achieve its targets for cutting emissions, as a consequence of the increased use of fossil energy. Instead, the cost of both emission rights and electricity will rise. Employers and workers will have to pay the price, while emissions continue to increase beyond our borders. Now is the time for common sense. It is clear that we cannot obtain global support for binding emission cuts, and that is why the emphasis must be on technical solutions, and the problem must be seen in different contexts: we need a different strategy to control those things that affect the climate. The short-term culprits are aerosols, soot, methane and ozone in the atmosphere: they act differently from the long-term ones, such as carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons or nitrous oxides. If we just concentrate on one, carbon dioxide, it shows our ignorance of the complexity of the problem.</p>

      <p sl="pl">On the eve of the vote on the report on a possible increase in the greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2020 from 20% to 30%, I would like to express my alarm at the conclusions, which go too far. In general, we agree with the implementation of the 3 x 20 objectives which have already been set, but the scale and cost of undertakings associated with the possible adoption of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be enormous. Investors, who are already bearing the costs of keeping up with competition from third countries in which environmental regulations are less rigorous than in Europe, are faced with a dilemma as to whether they should remain in Europe or relocate their companies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A unilateral increase in targets is not an effective way to prevent climate change. The proposed scenario of a 30% reduction will have a huge impact on sectors participating in the ETS, and will force them to step up measures to a significantly greater extent than those sectors not participating in the scheme.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Measures aimed at setting reduction targets even higher are detrimental to European industry as a whole. The pressure put on industry by climate policy will mean relocations to countries whose policies in this area demonstrate more common sense. On a global scale, this will not reduce emissions of gases which are harmful to the climate. The phenomenon of ‘carbon leakage’, or the relocation of industry outside the EU’s borders, is not a myth, but a real threat to economic growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to the World Bank’s report, implementation of the European climate and energy package will mean a loss to the Polish economy of 1.4% of GDP annually until 2020, and a loss to the EU as a whole of 0.55%. The World Bank also estimates that electricity prices will rise by around 26.2% in Poland, and by 12.6% in the EU as a whole. The EU’s previous target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions is already hard to swallow for Polish and Central European industry, due to the high proportion of coal used in their power industries. We accepted this challenge, however, and set about fulfilling our obligations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Poland cannot afford to increase the target for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 30%. One solution would be for the Member States to join a CO2 emissions reduction club, on a voluntary basis. I would call for common sense to prevail during tomorrow’s vote, against ambitions to reduce CO2 which are economically unfounded.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union, including Hungary, can only maintain its leading position in combating climate change by introducing new technological and economic solutions and through continuous innovation. Hungary could be a real winner where green economic growth is concerned. Our country still possesses CO2 emission allowances worth several billion HUF, which should be put on sale again by the government as soon as possible. Given the abundance of resources, we could produce huge quantities of raw material for bioenergy production. This is why I find it incomprehensible that the new Hungarian rural strategy excludes assistance for agricultural raw material production aimed at energy production. It is high time the Hungarian government made a commitment to extend renewable energy utilisation, and supported innovative national development. The EU, which is currently responsible for only 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, cannot stop climate change by itself. In large emerging countries such as China, Brazil, India or Russia, environmental consciousness is increasing, and immense markets may open up for European companies in alternative energy sectors. However, European companies will only be competitive on these markets if they are motivated by the European regulatory environment to pursue continuous innovation and development. This is why we need to adopt ambitious CO2 emission targets. Thanks to the positive CO2 balance of the new Member States, the emissions of the EU27 have already decreased by 17% compared with the 1990 level. Therefore, raising this target to 30% by 2020 is very realistic.</p>
