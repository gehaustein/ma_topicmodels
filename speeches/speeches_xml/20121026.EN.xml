      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, Belarus held parliamentary elections on 23 September. It will not come as a surprise to this House to hear me state my disappointment at the way they were conducted. The day after the election, the High Representative and Vice-President Ashton and I issued a joint statement expressing the European Union’s regret that Belarus had missed yet another opportunity to hold elections in line with international standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore share the assessment of this House, expressed both in the statement by President Schultz, Chairman Brok and other Members of the European Parliament, regretting the undemocratic nature of the parliamentary elections. This assessment is also reflected in last week’s Council’s conclusions and, I expect, will also be mirrored in your resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the assessment of the OSCE Election Observation Mission: ‘many OSCE commitments were not respected, despite some improvements to the electoral law’. It also notes that ‘while there was an increase in the number of candidates put forward by parties, prominent political figures who might have played a role in this context remained imprisoned or were not eligible to register due to their [so-called] criminal record’ – ‘so-called’ was my addition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our assessment of internal developments in Belarus remains pessimistic; things are not getting better, and the grip on civil society is being tightened. There is no sign of willingness by the Belarusian authorities to address our core concerns: respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. Last week the Council adopted conclusions and decisions regarding the review of restrictive measures: the so-called rollover of the existing sanctions. Both express our concern about the internal situation in Belarus as well as the state of play of the European Union’s bilateral relations with the country. The outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council also confirms the continuity of our established and consensus-based policy, namely the will to continue our policy of critical engagement and call for the immediate release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners and the discontinuation of restrictive measures, while at the same time reaching out to Belarusian society.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current situation, where there are few signs of progress from Minsk, we can, however, look at how to invest in the future and, at the same time, how to keep technical and diplomatic communication channels between the European Union and Belarus open. We have an interest in keeping a working relationship with Minsk. Technical dialogues and cooperation continue with the Belarusian administration, and we are keeping the country engaged within the multilateral track of the Eastern Partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main drive behind our policy is our commitment to strengthening engagement with the Belarusian people and civil society. It remains an essential aspect of investing in the future of Belarus. We must continue our engagement with Belarusian society as a whole, promoting people-to-people contacts. We are not trying to isolate the Belarusian people. It is particularly regrettable that the authorities are not taking up our offer to negotiate visa facilitation and readmission agreements between the European Union and Belarus. However, the Member States are striving to make optimal use of the flexibilities offered by the visa code to waive and reduce visa fees for some categories of Belarusian citizens or in individual cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European message should be brought to as many ordinary Belarusians as possible, including through our assistance projects. This is a priority. The European dialogue on modernisation with Belarusian society is an important part of this engagement and an essential aspect of our policy, providing a rare positive element in this overall sombre picture. The participation of the Belarusian authorities in the dialogue is an issue. It is needed because their absence raises questions about the viability of the dialogue. From our side, we continue to stress to the administration that we would welcome their constructive participation at technical level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our financial assistance to civil society has increased five-fold since the 2010 post-electoral crackdown and clearly this cooperation still has great potential. Let me also inform you that we are currently looking at how to further rebalance and better target our aid for civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, and while fully acknowledging the challenges we face, we believe that the European Union is following a balanced approach which will allow us to have an impact on developments in Belarus and enhance the prospects for future EU-Belarus cooperation. I look forward very much to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his latest interview for the British daily The Independent, President Alexander Lukashenko focused on criticising Western democracies, accusing us of behaving like bandits whilst claiming to promote democracy. According to President Lukashenko, the West is to demand a change of leadership in Belarus with a transfer of power to the opposition. The President is mistaken. We are not concerned about who governs Belarus. There are many shades of opinion in this House, and views as to which party would represent the best solution for Belarus vary. What we really want is for that country to be governed by people elected by the citizens of Belarus in free and fair elections. These are not just empty words. We are firmly convinced of the universal nature of fundamental rights and that they stem from the inalienable dignity of each human being. We are deemed to be behaving like bandits simply because we wish the people of Belarus to be able to benefit from the same rights and freedoms that the majority of other Europeans enjoy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at regular intervals we discuss here the outcome of the elections in Belarus, and at regular intervals we have to express our disappointment at the conduct of the elections because they are never free and fair. The Belarusian regime has again missed yet another opportunity to express its commitment to European values and, of course, also to end its self-imposed isolation.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can we do? I think the critical engagement policy presented by the Commissioner is the right one. On the one hand we need targeted sanctions, but on the other hand we should try to use all the means at our disposal to help Belarusian society – young people, NGOs – to help open up the country. Of course we also demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, especially – as a social democrat, I have to say – that of the leader of the independent social democratic movement in Belarus, Mikola Statkevich.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner Füle, thank you for your excellent contribution this morning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is no surprise that the parliamentary elections of 23 September failed once again to meet international standards. Let us be frank: nothing will change as long as Mr Lukashenko rules Belarus with an iron fist. Elections without fair competition are not elections. They are no more than a farce. They have resulted in a parliament in which, literally, there is not a single opposition member to be found any more.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is sometimes a tendency to resign ourselves to the isolation of Belarus but such apathy would be totally wrong. We should not lose faith in change and we must continue to work for the liberalisation of Belarus. I am pleased that Commissioner Füle demonstrated this morning that he is of the same opinion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Sanctions are only partially effective. The pressure really needs to come from below. The Belarusians themselves have to want a different kind of government, a different life. There are democratic movements in Belarus. They need to grow and for that they really need our support. That is why I call on Commissioner Füle to continue to work on strengthening civil society in Belarus as part of the new Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We also need to put pressure on the Belarusian regime to simplify visa requirements for its citizens and make visas affordable. This would enable us to have more exchanges. A Commission proposal is on the table but Minsk refuses to sign it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the Belarusian economy is also going downhill rapidly and the gap between it and the European Union is getting wider all the time. The country had good reason to join the customs union with Russia and Kazakhstan. It depends on investment and loans from Russia, and increasingly also from China. These countries do not ask any questions about the human rights situation in Belarus. We must not stop doing that and, above all, we must not stop supporting the Belarusians themselves.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, thank you. Commissioner, you will be aware that I value you and your work. Good work has been done, too, on this resolution under the leadership of Mr Rouček, and I am grateful for that. Unfortunately, I have to give the House the sad news that although, on the one hand, we are taking positive steps, as is the case today, on the other, my country is helping to make the situation worse for the people of Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It was revealed some 10 days ago that the Polish Foreign Ministry had issued 30 tax return forms to members of the opposition in Belarus, demanding payments related to maintenance allowances paid to them by Poland. This enabled the Belarusian authorities to identify the opposition members concerned. Only the day before yesterday, in fact, all of the grants awarded to the opposition in Belarus by Poland were published on the Foreign Ministry’s website. As if that were not enough, pressure was put on the press to refrain from publishing information on this scandal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to offer a heartfelt apology to all Belarusians, and assure them that Europeans and the rest of us Poles do not think in the same way as certain civil servants in the Foreign Ministry. I consider such behaviour to be outrageous, and wish to offer an apology, and draw it to the attention of the President, the Commissioner and the House. First and foremost, however, I would like to apologise to all Belarusians for the action taken by the Polish side. This is inappropriate for Polish policy and inappropriate for European policy. We should all be supporting the Belarusians, not informing on them and reporting them to the Belarusian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Blue-card question. – Madam President, it would appear that Mr Migalski has already launched his party’s election campaign. I should point out that the party concerned has not even reached 1 % in the opinion polls. I should like to ask Mr Migalski if he is aware that yesterday Mr Sikorski, the Foreign Minister, publicly apologised to the Belarusian people for that civil servant’s error and that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the individual in question, who has now been sacked? I also wish to ask Mr Migalski whether he really considers that this type of private spat concerning Poland and its domestic political scene is appropriate in the European Parliament. How will this help Belarusians?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-013-000" speaker_id="96800" name="Marek Henryk Migalski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Blue-card answer. – Madam President, it is my impression that Mr Lisek is criticising me personally. I shall not respond in kind, however, but will instead focus on the case in hand. I do indeed believe that this House is an appropriate place in which to comment on how Member States are honouring their commitments. I believe that what has taken place in Poland is disgraceful and intolerable and will bring shame upon us. I also believe that my comments in this House are not detrimental to Poland or the people of Belarus. Rather, it is the Foreign Ministry’s actions that are detrimental to Poland and the people of Belarus. I would remind Mr Lisek that the Foreign Ministry is headed by a colleague of his, and that he and his associates have a great deal of influence on what happens there.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am glad that the civil servant responsible for publishing the pages in question has been sacked. Why was he not sacked earlier, however? It has emerged that he had been sacked previously but the process had not been completed. I am conveying this information to the House for information. It is indicative either of total ineptitude within the Polish Ministry or a rather worse scenario. Mr Lisek, I hope that you, Mr Sikorski, and all Members of this House will work together to ensure that there is no repeat of this situation, and that nothing similar occurs, because it would make a laughing stock of us all, not just one particular person or party.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, 92.72727 % was the result celebrated by President Lukashenko’s associates in the most recent parliamentary elections. Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The official turnout at the most recent parliamentary elections in Belarus at the end of September was 74 %. Laughable was the damning verdict of Belarusian political analyst and author Valery Karbalevich. At numerous half-empty polling stations throughout the day of the elections on 23 September, independent observers and voters witnessed a crushing blow being dealt to Lukashenko’s regime. The repressive government in Minsk reaped what it had sown. If you systematically rig elections, you need not be surprised if civil society reacts accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Karbalevich rightly concludes that distrust of the Lukashenko regime has come out into the open with these elections. That should give the reform-minded elite in the country, in particular, a great deal to think about. The Council and the Commission would therefore do well to invest time and energy in patiently establishing relationships with them at this moment in time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must combine principles with change. As they say in German, Werte und Wandlung. That would greatly benefit both Belarus and the EU and I have every confidence that Commissioner Füle is thinking about this and working on it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the last election in Belarus was another example of the brutal regime of Mr Lukashenko. International observers noted a number of serious violations. The election took place in an atmosphere of political persecution and repression of the opposition, many of whom are still in prison. Strong sanctions and EU support for the opposition must continue. The IIHF should relocate the 2014 Ice Hockey Championship to prevent Lukashenko’s regime from self-promotion. The IIHF is fast losing credibility by collaborating with dangerous individuals who conspired against democracy and their citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Communist spy and KGB officer from Slovakia, Mr Široký, and Mr Lukashenko seem to be protégés of Mr Fasel and his IIHF. Such trends must change. The relocation of the Championship away from Lukashenko’s Belarus would be a good start.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, we have not seen any change or innovation in the European Union’s neighbour Belarus for almost 20 years. The power pyramid there is monumentally stable. Once again, we have seen elections without choice, recognised by the OSCE and other international organisations as undemocratic and unfair. However, I agree entirely with Commissioner Füle that even in this situation we need to continue a critical dialogue with Minsk and not isolate the people of Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The electronic archives show that over 18 years as many as 116 European Parliament resolutions on Belarus have been adopted, mostly in response to specific events in the country. I believe that it is time to prepare a more wide-ranging report that would try at Parliament level to propose ways of breaking the deadlock in EU-Belarus relations and modernising Belarus.</p>

    <intervention id="5-018-000" speaker_id="99416" name="Nikolaos Salavrakos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, I fully endorse Commissioner Füle’s description and assessment of the situation in Belarus, and consider it to be objective. I respect the policies which he is proposing and consider them prudent. The observers who were present during the elections on 23 September found that the ballot was not conducted impartially, and claimed that many civil rights, such as the right of assembly, right of association and freedom of expression, were not respected by the authorities; irregularities were also noted in the counting of votes.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the assessments give no indication of imminent change in the internal political situation in Belarus – a situation which has remained unchanged since 1994. The expulsion of the Swedish ambassador is a case in point. It is now clearly evident that Russia’s plan for the Eurasian Union is fully under way. Within the scope of the Neighbourhood Policy, amongst other things, the Union should redouble its efforts to encourage respect for human rights, freedom of expression and democratic principles in the country – though this should, of course, always be done with great care.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, President Lukashenko has stated that other elections in Belarus were only as democratic as was possible. We have to take his word for it. Where it is possible that opposition leaders were behind bars and not in the voting booths, where many candidates were not even able to register freely and the freedom of expression was degraded to a minimum, it can also be said that the elections were as democratic as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must condemn the Belarusian regime for constantly depriving its own people of their fundamental rights and freedoms and even degrading their human rights. Such a regime cannot be a partner of the Union. It should rather be those parts of Belarusian society that are trying to stand up to the regime. Indeed, there are some such people in Belarus. The Union should therefore invest in, and support the future of, a Belarus that is more democratic than is currently possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is becoming increasingly difficult to prepare resolutions on Belarus which can say something new. The next one could be one sentence long: ‘We reiterate the findings and positions stated in our previous resolutions’. It looks as if the President of Belarus has invented a time machine. This is the only reasonable explanation for why and how a country in Europe can freeze itself in today’s dynamic and interconnected world. There are very clear indicators which can measure whether elections are free and fair. They apply to every country in the world, and Belarus cannot be an exception. There, no elections have been recognised as free and fair since 1995: in other words, the legitimacy of all elected representatives is insufficient. If we talk to them we do not talk to the Belarusian people: it is as simple as that.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what can we do? Stay and wait? Engage and support? Punish and sanction? Everything has been tried so far, with ups and downs, but the final result is zero. The option is to invent something completely new, which would shake the people in Belarus and wake up a critical mass – not very realistic. Another is to follow an enhanced version of the current long-term strategy: a roadmap to democracy. Its course should be to gradually raise the awareness of the Belarusian people and Belarusian society, because change can be supported in Brussels but it should be prepared and should happen in Minsk.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at its most recent session, the Foreign Affairs Council expressed its grave concerns at the deteriorating situation in Belarus, the lack of respect for human rights, and the complete lack of democracy and the rule of law. The Council noted that the conduct of the parliamentary elections in September was non-transparent and unfair. In view of the critical situation, the EU has rightly suspended the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Belarus. I recommend that the new message we send to the Government of Belarus be equally unambiguous. On the other hand, we must assure the Belarusian people of our unconditional solidarity, since the European sanctions are targeted not at them but at the dictatorial regime.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I call upon the European External Action Service and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to act with the utmost resolve with a view to ensuring that Belarus cooperates unconditionally with international human rights forums, releases political prisoners with immediate effect, and calls a halt to torture and executions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">An unambiguous assessment of the elections has been made and there is no more to be done on the matter. We must bear in mind, however, that Belarus is still our partner within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. All of our efforts should be focused on Belarusian society, especially on those sections of it that can have some kind of contact with the outside world. I am thinking of students, people working in companies and those engaged in economic activities. As regards private entrepreneurs, I think that we should focus on people working as independent journalists, on those who represent the future of Belarus. I believe that is an area where many institutions and countries could make an effective contribution to shaping a new civil society in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such action is vital to ensure that Belarusian society is adequately prepared when the conditions are right for change. I feel that some of the instruments we are developing in this House and in the European Union could prove helpful in this regard. I should like to express my satisfaction with the efforts of the European Commission, particularly as regards the European dialogue on modernisation. I believe that many of the assessments made here are correct. Accordingly, I should like to call for instruments that could help to create something that would serve as a sound foundation for further development of the relationship between the European Union and Belarus, to be put in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>

No opposition representative succeeded because several of the prominent opposition leaders are either in jail or were prevented from standing as candidates.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the EU, we have practised a ‘two-track’ policy where we have sought to maintain dialogue with the public and have imposed sanctions on the political leadership.

What you described, Commissioner, what the European Commission is doing and planning to do, is just what we have all been referring to in this House. The issue is pretty clear. Essentially, we need to be consistent. First and foremost, we must be consistent in relation to sanctions against those who violate human rights. We know who they are, and unfortunately their number is increasing. Secondly, we need to be consistent in our support for civil society and the free media.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to draw attention to two specific issues. Firstly, there is a project known as Telewizja Bielsat, which has so far been consistently supported by Poland and a couple of other countries. I think it is now time for European funding to be devoted to this initiative. Secondly, we cannot fail to provide assistance to people who are suffering. I actually met with Mr Alexei Mikhailevich, a former presidential candidate, a few days ago. Mr Mikhailevich was tortured and was granted asylum in the Czech Republic. However, his family, wife and children have remained in Belarus, and to put things plainly, they have nothing to live on. We should deal with this, too.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is, of course, a great shame that there is one country in central Europe in which there are no free elections, where torture is practised, where the death penalty is in place and where political opposition is not allowed. As others have said already, it is important for us to continue cooperation with civil society; for example European youth and student organisations could be in closer communication with Belarusian young people and students, and the Member States could have some sway, offer university places to young Belarusians, because that would enable contact to be established with the strong, influential generation of the future.</p>

Following on from what Ms Jaakonsaari said, I would like to refer to a project that has been running in my home province of Lower Austria since 1989 between the city of Baranovichi in Belarus and the municipality of Stockerau. It is a twinning arrangement under which people in Baranovichi are able to make contact with Austrians, an exchange takes place via school projects and children from the city are able to travel to Stockerau and experience a different environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">It also encourages us in Stockerau to discuss the situation in Belarus. With personal contact comes a far greater personal interest in how the people we have got to know actually live. The towns and cities partnered with Stockerau were invited to participate in the municipality’s 1 000th anniversary celebrations. They laid on a real feast for us and a really close connection has developed. Examples of this kind of human political action help ensure that democracy can be felt in countries whose democratic standards lag far behind our own.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Dictators are sensitive when someone takes their favourite toy away. Their favourite toy is public display, showing off.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I think it would be very appropriate if we were to support the cancellation of the hockey championship in Belarus. In this way Lukashenko would lose a big show and it would be clear to people why he lost it. Those to whom it was not clear would find out. It is difficult for us to get close to the public in this country. With this type of gesture we would get close to the public.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I was extremely disappointed – but not altogether surprised – to receive the negative reports about the recent Belarus elections. These elections represented a rubber-stamping exercise to support a foregone conclusion. The Lukashenko regime, now in its 19th year, has been ruthless in its persecution of political opponents and gagging of the press as part of a desperate attempt to cling on to power by whatever means.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end, one man’s hubris has come at the expense of the hopes and dreams of a generation of Belarusian people, denied the opportunity to determine their own future in an atmosphere of fairness, transparency and freedom from fear, including fear of the KGB. Our only hope must be that the citizens of Belarus will eventually be granted the chance to vote for their own leaders, and live the lives that they choose. We in the European Union and in this Parliament should afford them every assistance to achieving that noble goal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am afraid I was held up in traffic and arrived late to this debate. I would be grateful if you could allow me the minute and a half allotted to my political group.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, we have witnessed a parliamentary election in Belarus that was no such thing. What was new, however, was President Lukashenko’s cynical recommendation that Europe could learn a thing or two from this electoral manipulation. Fortunately, the days of such hubris are numbered, even if this dictator has followed the example of North Korea and already marked his youngest son out as his successor to the throne. Events in Moscow leave me questioning, however, whether Mr Lukashenko really is Europe’s last dictator.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, 10 seats in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly remain empty, as we cannot tolerate the presence among us of representatives of a parliament that has no legitimacy. The Foreign Ministers have extended the sanctions against the regime, which is the right thing to do. We must be careful, however, that these measures are not undermined. There are around a dozen known agents who acquire foreign currency via private and bogus firms and organise exports and foreign investment, the proceeds of which end up in the dictator’s pockets. Instead of an entry ban for the regime’s supporters, we should adopt arrangements facilitating visas and travel for the Belarusian people.</p>
      <p sl="de">The appeal and attraction of a Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning European Union will not be lost on Belarus. However, we should avoid giving Mr Lukashenko’s truncheon-wielding lackeys the opportunity to practise dispersing mass demonstrations, as we succeeded in doing in Germany. The ‘soft power’ we can exert should also include targeted economic sanctions – which means, for a start, that Lufthansa must cease its maintenance of President Lukashenko’s government jet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank honourable Members for this interesting debate. As I said, I fully share the concerns expressed by Members regarding the political situation in Belarus. Let me reassure you that, together with High Representative and Vice-President Ashton – and I am very glad that this is actually the first occasion for her new managing director, Felipe Fernández de la Peña, who is also dealing with Belarus, to participate in this debate – we will continue to encourage the Belarusian authorities to take steps to fully implement Belarus’s international commitments to democratic principles and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that, under these circumstances, we have every interest in seeking to increase the impact of our policies on Belarus. We will continue to call for the unconditional release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners and insist that the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Belarus remains conditional on progress in the field of human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. I share your opinion that the forthcoming world ice hockey championship is an opportunity not to be missed for us to make our policy more visible and clear and to have an impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our policy of critical engagement with Belarus is a long-term challenge. The European Union’s policies are principled and have the clear goal of including Belarus in the family of democratic and open nations. However, we know that, for political and economic reasons, bigger changes in this country are likely to take time. We discuss our policy of critical engagement towards Belarus regularly and, as you can see, our policies and messages stay calibrated and balanced.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for the views you have expressed during the debate and for the draft resolution. There have been a number of critical remarks but, in addition to the critical remarks, some concrete suggestions on which we will reflect. In a situation like this, the principled position has to be combined with creative thinking, reaching out to those who would sooner or later deliver on the change.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also very much appreciate your call in the draft resolution to strengthen the dialogue for modernisation. I believe that, with even greater involvement of the Member States and with your support, we can turn this dialogue into an effective instrument for change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me add a personal remark. Time is not on the side of political prisoners, but I firmly believe that time is on the side of democratic change. Change will come sooner or later. It is inevitable and it is a strong European lesson to a European country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very glad to have the chance to address honourable Members today on the situation in Georgia and on the recent elections. Parliament contributed to the observation mission conducted in Georgia by OSCE-ODIHR, and to the balanced and highly pertinent statement of preliminary findings which was released on 2 October. I want to signal my appreciation for that work, and for the ongoing commitment of all Members to Georgia’s long-term democratic development.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can only support the assessment made by President Schulz: these elections were, in the main, competitive, free and peaceful. They indicate growing democratic maturity and underscore Georgia’s commitment to its democratic path.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, there will be important lessons to learn from these elections, and we will await the final report of OSCE-ODIHR with great interest. We should not forget the key issues that preoccupied us in the run-up to the polls – freedom of assembly, access to the media, campaign financing, and the use of administrative resources. It is important to remain vigilant on all these issues. I am glad that the European Union was able to contribute to the quality of these elections through media monitoring, parallel voter tabulation, and other forms of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been a change of government, but it is important to stress continuity in some critical areas. Georgia’s foreign policy continues to be oriented towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration. It is important to underline that clearly, and from the start. The new government has also already very clearly expressed its ambition to move forward at speed with critical processes such as the Association Agreement, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area negotiations, and the visa liberalisation process. In return, we have assured it of the European Union’s ongoing commitment to support those ambitions, in terms of technical support, policy dialogue, and the effective targeting of financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Tbilisi with the Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service, both of us representing High Representative and Vice-President Ashton. We met with Prime Minister Ivanishvili, the new Minister of Defence, Irakli Alasania, the new Foreign Minister, Maia Panjikidze, and the new Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, Aleksi Petriashvili. Obviously, these will be key relationships for the European Union in the coming months and years. We also met President Saakashvili; we underlined our appreciation of his statesmanlike conduct, emphasised our full support for the constitutional rights of the Presidency, and recalled the need for effective political opposition in any democracy. We also met representatives of civil society to listen to their impressions of the election and its aftermath.</p>
      <p sl="en">This visit was an opportunity to get to know our new interlocutors, and to stress three main points. Firstly, that all European Union ‘offers’ are still on the table, and we are ready to work with the new administration as quickly and as energetically as they wish. Secondly, that we expect both the cohabiting partners – Presidency and government – to build on the commitments they have made to a smooth and professional handover, and to support the long-term interests of Georgia and its people. Finally, we have of course reminded our hosts that the European Union is committed to Georgia’s territorial integrity. Through the Geneva International Discussions and the European Union Monitoring Mission, we are the guarantors of Georgia’s security. We will not step away from these responsibilities, but at the same time we expect Georgia to shoulder its responsibilities too.</p>
      <p sl="en">I came away reassured that Georgia’s democracy is in good health, and that both Prime Minister Ivanishvili and President Saakashvili are committed to working together and to the continuation of a smooth transfer of power in their country’s best interest. They will face significant challenges during their cohabitation, and we should not be complacent, but I believe we should lend both sides our impartial support and focus on values rather than personalities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, I very much look forward to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, my heartfelt thanks go to the Commissioner for his personal involvement in issues relating to Georgia. Discussions took place prior to the elections and I think that this dialogue will be continued, because Georgia needs it. Congratulations are of course due to the winning side, but above all, Georgian society deserves to be congratulated on passing the democratic test. One could go so far as to say that, despite various tensions, those elections were the best to have ever taken place in that part of Europe. I think that President Saakashvili deserves recognition for having recognised his party’s defeat and for transferring power peacefully, something that is unprecedented in the Caucasus region. We can but hope that the new government will maintain the direction of the country’s foreign policy and the pro-Western tendency embraced by Georgia a few years ago. We must, of course, monitor the situation to ensure that all is well, that democracy is working as it should, and that the President, the Government, the majority party and the opposition are all cooperating for the good of Georgia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me first of all congratulate the Georgian people on the outcome of these peaceful and free elections. For the first time in modern Georgian history we have seen a peaceful transition of power. It is a great achievement.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in a democracy this is not the end: there are huge tasks facing the political class in Georgia and the people of Georgia. The reforms have to continue. There must be cooperation between the winners and the losers, between the President and the new government. The tasks include internal reforms, both political and economic. As social democrats, we would also like to see social inequality being tackled, to see workers’ and social rights bolstered, to see assurances for the trade unions on free and independent movement and free and independent work, so that the rights of the Georgian people are guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been talk about foreign-policy orientation. The new government has stressed that it will continue on the Euro-Atlantic path, and we welcome that. But there is also a chance to normalise – or at least attempt to normalise – Georgia’s relations with its big northern neighbour, Russia. There is a chance to move forward with the situation in the occupied territories, and I think we will support that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner mentioned the association agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement. We should pay attention to these matters, and try to speed up the process. In the same way, we would like to see a speeding-up of the visa liberalisation process so that the Georgian people, especially young people, have a chance to come to the countries of the European Union, to engage in exchanges with us, and to move closer to European values and to the nations and people of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, these Georgian elections have once again demonstrated the democratic vocation of the countries of the Caucasus, and that of the Georgian people in particular. They were model elections given the democratic challenges that the country has faced in the past. With these free, competitive and fair elections, Georgia has proven that it can build its new democracy on European values, which it cherishes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Certainly, much more needs to be done to ensure a stable, undiluted democracy, particularly in the context of its conflicts with its larger neighbour, as one of my colleagues pointed out. We must support Georgia, however, in particular by opening up the visa regime for Georgian citizens, which will help to bring them closer to European values, and by completing the two agreements. I am certain that the current government, dominated by Liberals, will continue to build on Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic ambitions. It is a government that will attempt to stabilise and modernise the institutional framework, and will certainly not repeat Georgia’s totalitarian mistakes of the past. I believe that Georgia is now a model for other countries of the Caucasus, and it needs our continued support.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe, Commissioner, that what you are doing for Georgia is a successful initiative of the current Commission and we should all be proud of the way in which we have supported Georgia in its development and in bringing it closer to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his clear words. I would also like to follow up on what my colleagues have already said and congratulate Georgian citizens on a really democratic election and a peaceful transition of power. This is the first time that a change of government has been carried out by vote in the Southern Caucasus since the end of the Soviet Union, so this was really a good step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some things do still need to be improved in the electoral law, but I also hope that both sides, President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Ivanishvili, will work in a concerted effort seeking consensus and compromise in the time of cohabitation. I would like to remind them that cooperation and not confrontation is one of the principles of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, however, two issues which I would like to mention which I think it is important to tackle quickly and thoroughly in the short term. Firstly, Georgia needs a stringent and effective law on party financing and also a law on potential and actual conflicts of interest, to draw a clear line of separation between private and public interests for persons holding office. I think it is essential in a democracy that you know where parties get money from, and how campaigning is done. This needs to be transparent and a law on this matter needs to be enacted as soon as possible in the Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second thing: I would like to remind ourselves and everyone else who is listening about the shocking images of torture in Georgian prisons which we saw before the elections. It is necessary to hold a thorough investigation into that and to undertake an in-depth reform of the penitentiary system in Georgia so citizens in Georgia can enjoy life without violation of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Georgian parliamentary elections took place peacefully, with full respect for democratic principles and the electoral law. The presence of the European Parliament election observation mission and national parliament missions from countries including Poland undoubtedly contributed to this. The individuals directly involved deserve to be commended and thanked. Georgia is one of the founding members of the Eastern Partnership and has proved eager for wide-ranging cooperation with Europe from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The assurances given by the winning coalition after the election must therefore be welcomed. It stated that Tbilisi would continue to aim at accession to the European Union and NATO, and that the country would never return to the Russian sphere of influence, nor would it seek to accede to the post-Soviet Community of Independent States. In this context, confirmation of the stance to date regarding the Georgian provinces under Russian occupation is particularly significant. Our diplomatic offensive on this issue is vital. Continually strengthening relations with Georgia must be one of the aims of Europe’s foreign policy. The new government under Mr Ivanishvili has announced its intention to continue economic reforms and the fight against corruption. Brussels should therefore increase its efforts to support and promote development. I trust that the current excellent cooperation with Tbilisi will continue and that the actions announced by the new Prime Minister will be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, geographically speaking, the south Caucasus forms part of Europe. Judging by the motions for resolutions so far discussed in the European Parliament, including the one being discussed right now, most of my colleagues clearly do not understand that this involves relationships that are different from those in Western Europe.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is a fact that Bertha von Suttner, a great campaigner for world peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, found asylum in that country in the second half of the 19th century. It is also a fact that the infamous Joseph Stalin came from there. The south Caucasus is noted for its long-standing huge tangle of peoples and ethnicities. The great powers have always been involved there, whether it be Russia, Persia, Turkey or some of the present-day states of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Georgian brandy is renowned for its quality and Georgians for their warmth, and they are to be congratulated on their democratic elections. However, it has to be borne in mind that we are a long way to the east. Families stay together more than in Western Europe and family clans are far more involved in the political scene.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I take some of the injudicious wording of the motion for a European Parliament resolution to be a continuation of pronounced anti-Russian feelings. Indeed, this is nothing new in European Union policies relating to the Caucasus. I believe that the sentence ‘ … territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are still de facto occupied’ is quite unacceptable. The authors are also pushing for an ‘independent’ Kosovo, which is not a good calling card for these giants of European Union foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is time to stop the self-righteousness and double standards, and to promote normal bilateral relations with the new Georgian Government. This resolution certainly raises questions as to the seriousness of attempts at cooperation with the Russian Federation to resolve the situation not only in Georgia, but throughout the south Caucasus. It is time to get rid of colonial nostalgia and to begin to regard neighbours of the European Union as proper partners.</p>
      <p sl="cs">For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left cannot support this resolution.</p>

Perhaps my fellow Member should find out what has actually happened in Georgia and what the situation is in the Caucasus, and then he might realise that the right to self-determination has been trampled underfoot there.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There were three autonomous territories in Georgia, each with its own government. One of them was ousted by the harsh intervention of armed forces and the other two only really avoided this fate thanks to the intervention of the Russians. I think that it makes no difference whether it is the Russians or somebody else. It is rather a matter of whether the people in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are entitled to live there, because it is really a matter of life and death.</p>

In particular, I would like to thank the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which did a great job. I believe that these elections took place in a calm and peaceful atmosphere and were well organised. I hope that the new government will continue to cooperate with the European Union and NATO, and that relations between the EU and Georgia remain strong in the future.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a few incidents notwithstanding, the parliamentary elections in Georgia were largely free and democratic. Nine years after the non-violent Rose Revolution of 2003, President Saakashvili’s monopoly on power has been broken. The hero of the revolution has had to pay in this election for his transformation into authoritarian leader during his anti-corruption crusade.</p>
      <p sl="de">The mere fact that there is a strong opposition is undoubtedly a democratic achievement. It will soon become apparent whether and how this cooperation will work. It is to be hoped, in any case, that work will begin on the planned reforms, including that of the legal system, and, above all, that the country will continue to follow its pro-Western course, pursuing its goals of NATO and European Union membership or at least not losing momentum.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, a great deal will hinge on whether Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s next great hope for democracy and prosperity, can live up to the expectations placed on him. The first test for the new party, Georgian Dream, will surely be how it deals with the abuse of power committed by former Rose Revolutionaries.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I would first of all like to express my best wishes to Georgia’s new government, led by Prime Minister Ivanishvili. The key positions in it have been entrusted to people with a clear political and professional background and that, on its own, is a positive sign for both the people of Georgia and its foreign partners.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would also like to point out something that is seemingly paradoxical at first glance: President Saakashvili’s defeat and the peaceful shift of power are the strongest evidence that the Rose Revolution achieved its objectives. Georgia has proved that it is a functioning democracy. The welcome outcome, however, should not blind us to the worrying signs that were evident during the election campaign.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I believe that the elections were very close to being discredited and I am convinced that the EU’s strong presence acted as a deterrent. I therefore want to express my gratitude to Catherine Ashton and Stefan Füle for the excellent work that they and their teams carried out on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is time to implement rapidly the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe for the elections and to remedy any legislative shortcomings so that the presidential elections next year reaffirm the positive tendencies.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The current cohabitation of Prime Minister and a President come from different parties would pose a great challenge even to established democracies. I believe, however, that the shared long-term goals will help to overcome any conflict on a personal or party level, which, in my opinion, is the most serious threat facing Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is important for Georgia to continue its efforts to ensure good relations with the EU for the success of the negotiations on the EU-Georgia Association Agreement. Furthermore, we expect the new government to do more to help the poor sections of society, strengthening labour rights, and remedying the shortcomings and inequalities inherited from the recent ultraliberal economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, I look forward to the formation of the new Georgian delegation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly.

      <p sl="en">But let us not underestimate or forget how bad things had become: the reports of the international election observers about harassment and intimidation during the campaign; the regular reports from Amnesty International about the situation in Georgia; and those horrific prison torture videos that came out. Only time will tell whether Mr Saakashvili’s acceptance of defeat was a virtuous bow to democratic values, or a tactical retreat under international pressure, as Tedo Japaridze has suggested. The Foreign Affairs Council stressed the importance of an effective political opposition and a vibrant civil society and of supporting capacity-building.

      <p sl="en">In paragraph 10 of the motion for a resolution, we refer to the need for better rules on party financing in Georgia. It is true that such rules are needed, and I agree with my colleague Ulrike Lunacek there. But we should also focus on our own rules, in the context of a new set of rules for political parties and their financing at European level as well as party financing in the various Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am ashamed to report to this Chamber that the former Communists governing Estonia – important players in the old totalitarian Soviet system – are mismanaging public and private funds in the most cynical ways in order to reinforce their vertical power structure. We should demand that former Communists, who nowadays have the unfortunate habit of calling themselves Liberals, apply the same financing rules that we expect our Georgian friends to apply to their political parties.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I took part in the observation mission. On a technical level, the elections were fair; that is a great achievement and I congratulate the former government that organised them. I believe, however, that the Georgian Dream coalition used huge media and financial resources (the latter of dubious origin) to buy favours and votes, which is a common trend in the region. This type of politics creates major distortions in young democracies because it discourages hard work and fairness, and promotes a quick win.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The elections and transfer of power are a step in the right direction but they must be complemented by an efficient political system with the appropriate institutions. Unfortunately, in the excitement of the victory, the winners conveyed the wrong message by calling for the resignation of a President elected by popular vote. For a government that, hypothetically at least, intends to continue with the Association Agreement and move closer to Europe, its pressure and threats against its opponents are unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, a transfer of power has taken place in Georgia following a democratic, impartial and free election in accordance with OSCE and the Council of Europe. This is a historical step for Georgia; however, more such transfers of power are necessary in order for us to be able to say with any certainty that democracy and free elections are here to stay in Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="sv">During the transition period, all political parties must demonstrate that they are able to cooperate and take responsibility for Georgia’s future and the country’s route towards Europe. Cooperation and the ability to compromise will determine whether or not the period of constitutional coexistence is successful.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In connection with this, both Mr Saakashvili’s quick acknowledgement of the defeat of his party and also Mr Ivanishvili’s retraction of the demand for Mr Saakashvili to step down give me hope that this cooperation and willingness to compromise does exist. I urge these two gentlemen to work together for the well-being of Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also pleasing that the new government has expressed a desire to continue along the road to Europe, and that Ivanishvili intends to make his first trip to Brussels. However, it is just as important to continue the cooperation with NATO and the development of Euro-Atlantic integration. The EU intends to continue to develop its relations with Georgia.

There are worries, some of them expressed here, that the country, which has for so long lived in the shadow and under the threat of Russia, now has a billionaire President who made his fortune there.

      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, the people of Georgia did what they had to do. They did a good job. We may, of course, have some concerns about the financing of the election campaign and about its conduct. Not everyone is delighted with everything, but the Georgians did what they were called upon to do: they ran a democratic election. For a post-Soviet region, that in itself is an achievement and a success. If we do have certain concerns about the state of affairs, we should look first at our own actions, because our time has now come. We in the European Union have to work to create a scenario in which Georgia can be integrated into Western structures. We must fulfil the obligations we entered into, that is, ensuring the withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgian soil. After all, we are responsible for the implementation of that six-point plan. The people of Georgia have done what they had to do, and now it is our turn.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when I was in Batumi in July this year, I said that Georgia would not be the same after the forthcoming parliamentary elections – those elections would change Georgia. I said we would either have, for the first time in Georgian history, a transfer of power through democratic means, or we would have a strong and constructive opposition. I did not know at that time that we might end up with both of those at the same time – a change of power and a strong opposition. I take it as a major sign of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank all those Members who have contributed to this useful and interesting discussion. I want to reassure you of my personal commitment to following through on our promises to Georgia, including the one which you have stressed a number of times – the one related to the territorial integrity of Georgia. Maintaining the pace of our political association with Georgia is vital to the credibility of the Eastern Partnership and to the prospects for stability and peaceful development in the Southern Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to underline the valuable role of this House in supporting Georgia’s democratic development so far. I am confident that you will continue in this work, helping Georgia to build stronger democratic institutions, to implement all the lessons learned from the October elections, and to encourage an effective parliamentary dialogue between government and opposition, in the service of long-term policy continuity, accountability and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I may, I would add the two following remarks. Mr Danjean raised an important point, and I wanted to make it absolutely clear that I did not miss the opportunity to make a strong call on the EU authorities to resist the temptation for political retribution. I have to say that I found in Prime Minister Ivanishvili a committed partner, interested in strengthening democracy and continuing to make the best use of the deepening of political association and economic integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I think was the most impressive element of my recent trip last week to Georgia was my individual conversation with Prime Minister Ivanishvili and President Saakashvili, both of them having a positive assessment of the transfer of power so far. I called on them to build on that positive experience and to create a strong basis for being able to address the many challenges this cohabitation will bring – and, make no mistake, there will be many.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I may also continue a thought Mr Tarand expressed – let me use the Georgia case but I think it is actually an issue which covers more countries – when we face the election in our partner countries, the time before the elections and after the elections is sometimes also an opportunity for the political families in this House to shadow, to a certain extent, the competition of the main political parties in those elections. I believe that this is a normal political reaction of this noble House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to make the following plea. The stronger the bipartisan support for strengthening democracy that comes from this House, the more opportunity the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission and all of us will have to actually deliver our assistance to strengthen democracy in those countries.</p>

I also welcome the fact that, in addition, Mr Ivanishvili would like to make NATO membership and closer EU integration a reality for Georgia.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the increasing crackdown on human rights and civil liberties by the Government of the United Arab Emirates is worrying. The current policy of detention, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and political activists has swept up prominent human rights lawyers, judges, law professors, bloggers, student leaders, religious conservatives and liberals alike.</p>
      <p sl="en">Particularly worrying is the fact that many of the detained are kept incommunicado, denied legal assistance and allegedly subjected to torture. In fact the only information we seem to have about the detainees is provided by the UAE Human Rights Committee, which is a government organisation and does not supply independent or credible information. Even when alleged national security concerns are at stake, the UAE authorities need to ensure that detainees deemed to have broken the law are charged with a crime, provided with legal assistance of their choosing and brought before a judge in a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also call on the UAE authorities to enforce freedom of speech and press freedom, which are granted under the Constitution in the UAE, since no real enforcement of such freedoms can take place when the harassment of those who call for greater political participation and inclusive institutions is not independently investigated, and when the penal code allows for the prosecution of those who today criticise the government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another matter of great concern, which we wish was in the resolution which we are to adopt, is the situation of migrant workers who are badly discriminated against and not protected in the UAE.</p>

It is my belief, therefore, that ideological responses will not get us very far. We must behave with fairness towards this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is the case that the Gulf States, and the United Arab Emirates in particular, have probably the fairest governments in the region. However, we must naturally criticise all instances of human rights violations. That is why we are calling for the release of political prisoners; that is why we are calling, for example, for the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung to be able to re-open its external office. We are voicing criticism, but we cannot make urgent and unfair political demands of a generalised nature. That is why we are making quite that we want to reserve this urgency for core human rights and that we are offering the United Arab Emirates a fair human rights partnership.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the UAE is a relatively open and diverse society with more than 100 000 British citizens residing there. This openness to outside influences continues to result in a better understanding among the governing élite of the importance of human rights. The EU and the UAE have an important economic and security partnership as well. The UAE’s human rights indicators are generally a lot better than most other Arab States. Women, for instance, occupy senior positions throughout the government, business and civil society, including three lady ambassadors. Migrant labourers benefit from recent legislative changes to protect their rights and welfare. The UAE has also taken important steps to crack down on human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not to gloss over concerns about the arrest of 62 Emiratis, but sadly most of these detainees appear to be Islamist hardliners who would like to reverse all the progress made in that country by closing down the churches. Mr Salavrakos has left, but he got it completely wrong: the people in prison want to close down the churches and persecute Christians, and they want to repress women. Those in this House who think that religious fundamentalism is the answer to improving human rights in the Gulf are sadly mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst the ECR Group accepts that there are serious concerns about some aspects of human rights in the UAE, the situation is far worse in some neighbouring countries. Indeed, Iran, which regularly executes juveniles and gay people, is perhaps the most shocking. This resolution today is therefore unnecessary because it distracts attention from the real issue in the Gulf region: Iran’s desperate efforts to acquire nuclear arms, and its gross violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course the UAE Government must fully investigate the allegations against the 62 detainees. If there is no good evidence against them, these individuals should be released. If, on the other hand, there is clear evidence of a crime, the government should charge them and try them without delay in accordance with the law. But the idea that the UAE is a serious human rights violator is completely absurd.</p>

My surprise is due to the fact that this is the first time that we have actually taken notice of the medieval conditions under which they live, kept strictly apart from foreign workers.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We have at last noticed the medieval relationships that prevail in political life in those countries. I do not know where Mr Tannock got his data.

Two thousand years have passed since the time of the Emperor Vespasian, but I believe that this truth still applies, as I am hearing here.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, workers’ rights in the United Arab Emirates are currently facing serious challenges. The legal framework is currently very unfair for migrant workers, gives too much power to employers and allows them to interfere in the lives, including the personal lives, of their employees. There are laws impeding essential labour rights such as freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Without such rights, workers who are also immigrants have no way of asking for better treatment and so are condemned to a demoralising and inhuman existence. This has to stop.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call upon the authorities of the United Arab Emirates to move towards providing greater equality in the workplace and to build a good legal framework that gives workers their rights, allowing them freedom of association, granting them freedom of expression inside and outside the workplace, and giving them citizenship rights in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

      <p sl="fi">A matter of great concern to which attention has already been drawn here is the continuing weak status of women and the situation of migrant and domestic workers.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the United Arab Emirates represents oil, sheikhs, sun and luxury, but it also represents less pleasant and less modern things, such as torture, stoning, beheadings, public floggings and the oppression of women. Then there are the terrible working conditions in the booming construction industry, affecting guest workers in particular. Every year, a large number of guest workers in the region die as a result of inadequate safety standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particularly shocking is a case that I would like to mention today. With all the whitewashing, I was unaware that a compatriot of mine, an Austrian doctor named Eugen Adelsmayr, was sentenced a few days ago to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates. He was fortunate; it could have been the death sentence. He was accused of having caused the death of a patient. What is astonishing about the case is that three expert statements exonerating Dr Adelsmayr were disregarded. It is also interesting that, in the course of being translated in Dubai, the statement by the authorities suddenly shrank from 25 to 6 pages and that the all-important 19 pages exonerating Dr Adelsmayr suddenly disappeared from the file.</p>
      <p sl="de">This tallies with the human rights reports indicating that nepotism is apparently alive and well in this country and that evidence is blindly disregarded.

They have been jailed and they have also been discriminated against. In such situations, improvements are needed, although, at the same time, it is of course necessary to take care that the country does not slide into the hands of hardline fundamentalists.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I was also able to ascertain in person during the visit to the United Arab Emirates of the Delegation for relations with the Arab Peninsula of which I am a member, I consider that the relations the European Parliament is building with the UAE are positive and constructive.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have always worked with mutual respect and our dialogue is based on this premise. I therefore feel that the wording of some paragraphs of this resolution renders it excessively critical, and does not take into account the efforts the UAE is making to acknowledge the human rights of workers and women. We are all aware of the uprisings taking place across several countries in the Arab world, such as Bahrain, and especially Syria, but from what I was led to believe, I do not feel it to be at such risk of degeneration as one might imagine.

The human rights and civil liberties of the people are suppressed, while the stage where this tragedy is taking place is decorated with oil money.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the resolution we express our deep concern for the security and fate of the human rights defenders, political activists and civil society actors and call on the United Arab Emirates to grant to all people their fundamental rights.

      <p sl="fi">The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt achieved victory through the democratic process, but the outlook for the future there is questionable. Are they interested in pursuing democracy and good governance or in pursuing political control? Human rights groups in Egypt have expressed their concern about aspects of the new constitution because it diminishes women’s rights and is unclear as to who falls within the scope of Sharia law and who does not.</p>

Human rights in the UAE.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UAE is one of the better places in the Middle East compared to some of the other countries. The human rights record in some of those neighbouring countries is appalling. Why are we talking about the UAE and not about those countries? Is it some envy or jealousy that we are expressing? Why is it that we had this extraordinary speech from my colleague Mr Kohlíček saying that people are going from India to live in terrible conditions in the UAE? India is a democracy and, if they leave India to work in the UAE voluntarily – nobody is taking them by force – then return and then go back again, that means that the conditions in the UAE must be better than in India. If the conditions were not better than India, why would they go?</p>

      <p sl="en">The UAE has a better record on human rights, on looking after its migrant workers and on all the other conditions on the ICCP of the United Nations than of any of the other countries in the region.

Firstly, Ms Ojuland is quite right: we should not allow oil to blind us to human rights issues. Mr Deva is, of course, absolutely correct: things are worse in other Arab countries. That cannot, however, justify not mentioning these cases in the United Arab Emirates. Secondly, Ms Korhola is right to state that winter is now upon us as far as human rights are concerned. That could, however, have been predicted earlier.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU has followed the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the United Arab Emirates with some concern in recent months. As was recalled by honourable Members, several individuals were arrested in 2011 and 2012 simply for expressing their political views in the media or for signing an on-line petition on the internet. That petition asked for political and institutional reforms in a peaceful and respectful manner. Some of these individuals were tried and even deprived of their UAE citizenship. They were subsequently pardoned, but the legal case against them has not been filed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whereabouts of many of the other 60 political activists currently under arrest is not known. This is unacceptable and in breach of international conventions which the United Arab Emirates has signed and ratified. In addition to this, the UAE authorities closed down the offices of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung this spring. This is a prestigious foundation which was carrying out excellent work in the UAE. Never have the UAE authorities provided a satisfactory explanation for this eviction, which for the EU is all the more difficult to accept as that foundation was implementing an EU-funded project aimed at enhancing understanding and cooperation, which then had to be deeply redesigned.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these cases of restrictions of civil and political rights, fundamental freedoms and human rights point to a deteriorating trend that cannot leave us indifferent, especially because of the friendly relations between the EU and the UAE and the good cooperation on several matters of common interest in the recent past.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has repeatedly voiced its concern to the UAE Government, including very recently, through diplomatic channels. Human rights and fundamental freedoms were discussed with the Gulf Cooperation Council at the latest ministerial meeting that took place in Luxembourg in June. These issues will certainly feature on the agenda of the next meetings with the Gulf at all levels, and the same messages were conveyed during the visit of a delegation of this Parliament earlier this year. The EU is ready to discuss these issues with the UAE and to support them in case they need and want our support.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we want to talk to all stakeholders, activists, civil society and human rights defenders too, and not only the government of the country. In this context, the upcoming establishment of an EU delegation in Abu Dhabi, strongly supported by this Parliament, will definitely be an element enabling us to do more and better.</p>
      <p sl="en">A specific case was raised by Member of Parliament Obermayr in relation to Dr Adelsmayr, which the EU has been following very attentively since the very beginning of this case, in close cooperation with the Austrian authorities. We remain ready to undertake any steps that may provide necessary with the UAE authorities in order to resolve this situation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the Taliban’s cowardly attack on Malala Yousafzai awakened the world to the tragedy that is the lives of women and girls in Pakistan, now the world’s third most dangerous country for women. A fundamentalist, extremist movement that we call ‘Islamic’ but is in fact anti-Islam, embodied by the Taliban, is the source of violence against women in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan, denying them their role in society, including their basic rights to education, to civic participation, to choose how to live their lives, and, as we are seeing in Malala’s case, to life itself. Malala’s tragedy shocked the world and shocked Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The wave of solidarity generated around this courageous girl, whose only crime was to take action and speak out to demand her rights, cannot come to nothing. It is time for us to call a halt to ‘business as usual’ with Pakistan. It is time to demand that the Pakistani civil and military authorities break free from dangerous ties and the controlling power of the Taliban and make real efforts to protect their people against intolerance and religious violence, which hit women and girls particularly hard.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union cannot cultivate relations or invest in cooperation agreements with a government that remains in denial and does nothing while girls are attacked and killed simply for going to school, forced into marriage, traded as currency in the settlement of disputes, and trained by armed groups to carry out suicide attacks with the support of Pakistan’s military intelligence services. It is with Pakistani civil society, which is rallying, that the European Union must engage.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Taliban’s attack not only has religious or political motivations, but aims to suppress and wipe out fundamental human rights and deny women dignity and the right to education. Such is the culture and lifestyle model the Taliban propose to the Muslim world, with utter contempt for their own lives and the lives of others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we are discussing the case of Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old girl from the Swat Valley in Pakistan who, on 9 October, on her way to school, was shot in the head and neck and severely wounded. Of course we, the European Parliament, stand firmly behind Malala and her family. That is clearly expressed in our resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tehrik-i-Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack. Furthermore, they have issued a statement to the effect that they would attempt to kill Malala Yousafzai again if she recovers from her injuries. Women and girls continue to become victims of domestic violence, trafficking and forced marriages and are being traded in the settlement of disputes. The perpetrators of violence against women and girls in Pakistan remain unprosecuted.</p>
      <p sl="en">My belief is that, wherever children become a target of military attacks and this is tolerated by the leadership of the country, that regime and that nation do not have a future. Children should go to school. Children should be better educated than their parents, and if their fathers, uncles or older brothers prevent children from enjoying even their very basic rights, such as the right to education, it is lamentable.</p>

In the interests of clarity, we unfortunately have to recognise what we are often reluctant to put into words, namely, that a considerable part of that population accepts the Taliban and their practices. That is a real tragedy because it may affect the future of the country and the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">There has been political and public outcry in Pakistan over this tragic event, and we should be supporting that outcry. The women’s caucus in the parliament has been instrumental in changing the laws in Pakistan. The problem will now be the implementation, because for some, like the Taliban, education is a threat to the power structure. We have seen almost 1 000 attacks on schools in that area of Pakistan, so we know it is crucially important for the government to invest in universal education and an open curriculum. We should be supporting it in every way we can to stand up against the forces of oppression.</p>

May I firstly take the opportunity to welcome the medical assistance provided on the ground and later in Pakistan, and also at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where Malala arrived a few days ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Her courage in campaigning for the right to education has really touched the world. We have to look at the situation in Pakistan, where 7 million children are out of school, some due to the practice of child marriage, others due to child labour, and others simply because parents are too frightened to send their children, particularly girls, to school.</p>
      <p sl="en">The House today is urging the Pakistan Government to step up its efforts in respecting the provision of primary education to all children and tackling the issue of youth radicalisation in madrasas, where a mandatory standard curriculum of basic education, along with a robust inspection system, is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pakistan is a sovereign state, so we in the EU cannot tell it what to do, but we must support it in the difficulties it is encountering. How can anyone think it is reasonable to try to kill a girl just because she wants to go to school?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start by expressing my deep respect for Malala Yousafzai’s courageous stand to fight for the right to education. The Taliban’s attack on her life highlights the grim prospects for young women and girls within Pakistan. It is the third most dangerous place in the world for women. Hundreds of schools are attacked and destroyed by radical, right-wing Islamic groupings, which unfortunately are growing stronger. Of course, as always, it is ordinary working people, and in particular women, who bear the disastrous consequences for the increasing disintegration of Pakistani society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Developments in Pakistan cannot be separated from developments in Afghanistan. The resurgence of reactionary Taliban forces in both Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot be seen separately from the US-led occupation of Afghanistan and the US drone attacks in north-west Pakistan, which have so far killed about 3 000 people. A recent US law report concluded that ‘the number of high-level militants killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low, estimated at just 2 %’. Evidence suggests that US strikes have facilitated recruitment to violent, non-state armed groups and motivated further violent attacks. The drone war in Pakistan must be ended.</p>

The occupation of Afghanistan and the drone war on Pakistan act, in reality, as a recruiting sergeant for right-wing Islamic forces. That is the reality. It is these same forces that are carrying out attacks on schools and these same forces – like the Taliban – that obviously attempted to kill Malala. That is recognition of the reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, can you defend the attack on – and the continuing occupation of – Afghanistan as really having anything to do with the September 11 attack? It has become clear that there is very little connection between the two, and that it was part of a pre-existing plan.</p>

      <p sl="fi">This time in Malala’s case, it is different, and it is encouraging to see how extensive support has become for her throughout Pakistan and the rest of the world. There has been a backlash against violence and hatred.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The issue of education and the rights of all is an important aspect of combating terrorism. Courageous Malala began a blog when she was 11, writing about her life in a Taliban-controlled area of Pakistan. About how she hid her schoolbooks under her scarf and how she continued her studies when the Taliban prohibited girls from attending school.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There are several million children in Pakistan who do not go to school, and most of them are girls. The teaching of critical and analytical thought frightens terrorist organisations such as the Taliban. Pakistan has undoubtedly found a new champion.

In Malala’s words, unless the new generation receives pencils and books, they will receive weapons from the terrorists.</p>

      <p sl="pl">A 14-year-old girl was shot and seriously injured in Pakistan on 9 October. Her only offence had been to promote girls’ right to education. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and made a declaration stating that they would kill anyone who campaigned against Islamic law. The outcome of this tragic incident was that the seriously injured young girl, Malala, became a national symbol of resistance against the Taliban regime. In 2011 alone, 152 cases of attacks by armed groups on school facilities in the area were recorded. Not only are young girls the victims of violence, but they are also forced into marriage and traded like commodities. It is true that the Government of Pakistan has recently introduced a range of provisions aimed at protecting young girls, but it will take many years for these provisions to be fully implemented. In this context, I welcome the Union’s readiness to support Pakistan in its efforts to comply with international standards concerning the safety of its citizens and the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination, and in ensuring that that all social groups enjoy equal rights and civil liberties.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Besides the case of this young Pakistani girl, who has become a symbol, I would remind you that young girls in Afghanistan have to deal with this unacceptable situation every day. The extensive violence to which they are subjected no longer makes the headlines, as it did 10 years ago, when we wanted to justify our military action in Afghanistan on the grounds of emancipating Afghan women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must therefore repeat it again: we cannot forget them. That is the message that the Afghan parliamentarians wanted to get across when they visited the European Parliament a few weeks ago.

      <p sl="en">Like 75 million girls worldwide, Malala has been denied the opportunity to learn – something which so many of us take for granted. While access to education for all children is, of course, our ultimate objective, it is becoming more and more evident that in many countries this is a problem that is unfortunately all too pertinent for girls.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Her disgraceful, indeed, shocking case leads us to two depressing observations about the education system in Pakistan. Poverty forces many parents to send their children to madrassas where education is free. These madrassas are in fact where Islam, or Islamic studies, is a legal requirement, thereby promoting intolerant ideas, not only in relation to religious minorities, but also in relation to the education of women and girls.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To sum up, the real problem in Pakistan is the completely inadequate funding of the education system itself. The fact that Malala comes from the Swat Valley, where only one in three girls goes to school, says a lot.

Our resolution urges the Pakistani authorities to combat discrimination against girls and women, to respect the constitutional right of equal access to education for girls and boys, and to guarantee the safety of girls in schools. The European Union must be more actively involved in combating the Taliban threat.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we, as the European Union, have an obligation to protect the fundamental rights of all citizens. It goes without saying that we must do so within each of our 27 Member States, but we must also do our best to protect those citizens residing in non-EU States. It is our duty to call for the basic rights of Pakistani women and children to be protected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old girl who was attacked because of her outspoken call for women’s education, is just the latest victim of violence and oppression against women in Pakistan. Pakistan has made efforts to curb violence, passing laws in the fight against discrimination and violence against women. We must do our part to show Pakistan that this is not enough. The Global Gender Gap Index still rates Pakistan as the third most dangerous place in the world for women. The Union must show its strength and ensure that EU-provided assistance, trade and development aid is conditional upon Pakistan’s ability to ensure basic protection and rights for its citizens. Pakistan must continue to make strides by providing proper education and safety for women.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, irrespective of their country and religion, the right to education must be guaranteed for all children and gender discrimination must be condemned. The Taliban’s actions in Pakistan threaten the country’s internal security and future development. In 2012 alone, the Taliban conflict led to the destruction of 250 schools and damage to another 750. It is worrying that the authorities failed to provide better protection for these schools.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also worrying that there are repeated attacks on young girls wishing to attend school. The attackers invoke religious reasons but there is no religion that prohibits women from exercising their right to education. The Pakistani authorities must prevent future attacks and guarantee equal access to education for both men and women.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, in recent years we have seen a whole raft of literary accounts of the situation of women, and particularly girls, in Pakistan. They are written by people who have spent years observing the situation, in rural areas above all, and who, by using examples from their own lives, have described how girls are denied an education, how young women, once married, are pushed out of the workplace, how normal it is still is, in spite of legal provisions to the contrary, for women to be dependent on older brothers or their husbands.</p>
      <p sl="de">Women make up 30 % of the Pakistani Parliament and a great deal of progress has already been made. However, the laws adopted in Pakistan also need to be enforced and to become part of everyday life. I see in the case of Malala Yousafzai a powerful appeal to us to provide the help and support needed to achieve that. We have a responsibility to promote human rights and civil liberties in Pakistan. We must acknowledge the progress that has already been made there at parliamentary level, but, most importantly, we must see to it that it is put into practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is a matter of regret that the Pakistan Government proved incapable of protecting its own citizens from such wickedness. Unfortunately, there is a history of Pakistani people, including Christian ministers and converts, being targeted because they challenge the Taliban’s twisted philosophy, including now the threat to kill the medics who are trying to treat her.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is hard to find the words to condemn strongly enough this sickening attack. However, that condemnation has echoed across the world and it is gratifying that so many voices in Pakistan itself have also been raised in anger and in opposition to Malala’s fate, not least those of many Muslim religious leaders in Pakistan.

Through her opinions and raw courage, the 14-year-old has become a bugbear for the Taliban. The fact that women’s right to education is causing concern in certain traditional societies is not too startling. What is absolutely amazing, however, is that such societies can go to such extremes as to attempt to use weapons to silence 14-year-old children calling for the right to an education.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Vice-President/High Representative Ashton has strongly condemned the shooting of 14-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was attacked on 9 October by extremists. She described this as a vile aggression and an assault both on basic human values and against all human rights defenders in Pakistan. It is encouraging that Malala is responding well to her treatment at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and, like all of the Members who have spoken here, we too wish her a speedy recovery from her injuries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is utterly disturbing that the Pakistani Taliban, who took responsibility for the attack, announced that they would try to kill Malala again should she recover from her injuries. We expect that the Pakistan Government will make every effort to ensure the safety of Malala Yousafzai and her family, and others who are facing similar threats. Malala is well known for advocating girls’ rights to education in Pakistan. She took a courageous stance against the Taliban, who launched an insurgency in the Swat Valley in 2009 where she is from. We can only admire this girl for her courage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Education is one of the EU’s priority areas for cooperation with Pakistan, with the emphasis on basic and vocational education. In doing this, we pay special attention to ensure access to education for girls. We want to work with Pakistan to build an education system which helps to promote tolerance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Issues relating to the rights of women and children are regularly raised in the European Union’s human rights dialogue with Pakistan, most recently during the February 2012 EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, and the High Representative addressed this question during her visit to Islamabad on 5 and 6 June.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has encouraged the Pakistan Government to take urgent measures to ensure protection for the rights of women. Moreover, we provide funding for a range of human rights projects in Pakistan, which have included trafficking in human beings, ending discrimination and violence against women and children, access to justice and women’s political empowerment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important new legislation has been introduced and we intend to work closely with the provinces, which now have widespread responsibilities in these areas. But we are deeply concerned at the damage that the climate of intimidation and violence is doing to Pakistan’s development. Following adoption of the EU-Pakistan engagement plan, we aim to enhance the existing dialogue by regular sectoral dialogues on security, including the rule of law and access to justice, as well as human rights. Countering violent extremism is expected to be part of this dialogue. We hope to step up our cooperation with Pakistan in the coming years. Supporting Pakistan’s democratic institutions and its civil society must be a central part of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The incident on 9 October led to outrage throughout Pakistani society. Prime Minister Ashraf was right when he reacted by saying that Pakistan should not allow the future of its children to be endangered by a militant mindset. He has pledged to uproot the menace of extremism. We should do whatever we can to help those in Pakistan who are ready to stand up against terrorism and ideologically-motivated violence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am sure that we all agree that the case of Malala Yousafzai must not go unnoticed by the European Parliament. For over a fortnight now, we have been following news of the health of 14-year-old Malala. This young girl bravely fought for her dreams and the dreams of thousands of Pakistani girls like herself, and became the target of a brutal attack.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Pakistan is one of the three most dangerous countries in the world for women. Several hundred so-called honour killings take place there every year, and there are also cases where women are punished by having acid poured over them. Reporting such incidents to the police and taking a case to court calls for heroism. In Europe, equal access to education is universally accepted but in Pakistan it remains a privilege for males only. Pakistan ranks second in global league tables for the number of girls without a primary education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Malala almost had to pay the highest possible price for her determination and for speaking out about the right of all girls to make their own decisions on their future. It should be borne in mind that the attack on Malala is also an attack on all defenders of human rights and fundamental values. We have to respond. After all, one of the objectives the Union set itself was to develop relationships with third countries based on the principles of democracy, respect for the rule of law and respect for civil liberties. With this in mind, I fully support the text of the resolution and call on the European Commission to regularly monitor the work of the Government of Pakistan to implement the provisions concerning discrimination and violence against women.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the problem of land grabbing in the developing world is clearly illustrated in Cambodia, where about 400 000 people have been displaced and dispossessed of their land and homes by local and national authorities and corporate businesses. This policy, which was not properly addressed in the last review of the Land Concession Law, prevents national reconciliation and lasting stability, increases inequality, harms sustainable development and calls into question the legitimacy of the government. The situation is only made worse by the use of excessive force against activists and protesters, for which no one is held accountable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, we urge the Cambodian Government to cease forced evictions and put in place a transparent and accountable legal framework in cooperation with civil society and in compliance with international standards, namely granting those evicted compensation and adequate accommodation.</p>

As we all know, four human rights activists were recently accused of anti-state crime and were sentenced by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court on 1 October 2012. We are talking here about a radio station accused of a crime against the state because it aired opinions that criticised the government. However, as we are probably all aware, Cambodian radio stations are controlled by the government or government bodies. This is an alarming situation, especially in view of the forthcoming general election in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I urge the Commission to send observers to that election. The previous observers set out clear recommendations on reforming the electoral process and we must verify whether or not they have been implemented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Cambodia’s land distribution policy is inherently unjust and arbitrary. In the last 10 years, at least 400 000 people have lost or been driven from the land on which they lived. The Prime Minister, Hun Sen, announced this year that he would make changes to this unfair land distribution policy, but there is little confidence that the government will act on this announcement. New abuses have already been reported and the old problematic dispossession cases continue.</p>
      <p sl="de">We urge the Cambodian Government to abolish these unfair land distribution measures and, in particular, to review the granting of land to over 200 companies and to withdraw the concessions where need be. Those who are dispossessed of their land or lose their livelihood and then stand up for their rights find themselves arrested as a result. We call for the immediate release of all land rights activists in Cambodia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power in Cambodia for 27 years. He presides over a government which is authoritarian and corrupt and, as I found when I visited the country, a people which lives in fear of arbitrary government action. Though there has been some improvement – largely due to the efforts led by the European Union – the judiciary is not independent, elections are not free and fair, and just this week the Prime Minister welcomed the threats by the two main opposition parties to boycott next year’s elections. Yet any victory by his party in the event of a boycott would be as meaningless as Mr Lukashenko’s victory in Belarus last month.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unless the conditions exist for the opposition to play a full and fair role in the elections, no international support should be provided for those elections.

      <p sl="en">The second item of concern is the government’s handling of land concession policies. This is an internal problem, of course. However, the fact that over the past decade almost half a million people have been displaced and dispossessed of their homes and land has not only led to violent clashes but also to deepening poverty. I ask the Cambodian authorities to stop politically-motivated harassment of the opposition and civil rights activists, and we urge Cambodia to reform its election system – to bring it into harmony with international standards and the UN recommendations – and, finally, to enforce a moratorium on forced evictions of landowners.</p>

I, myself, observed the extent to which political initiatives are hindered by the administration, freedom of speech and assembly are virtually non-existent and any political activity is undertaken at great personal risk.

Now there is also the issue of the leader of the opposition, who is exiled from Cambodia.</p>

In Parliament, there is a robustness in the various debates on Cambodia that I would like to see in the other institutions too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the human rights situation in Cambodia has continued to deteriorate in 2012. Violations of land and housing rights are still common, along with intimidation and criminalisation of human rights defenders and political activists. The cases of Mom Sonando and Chut Wutty and others are all worrying examples of the human rights situation. There has been increased granting of agro-industrial concessions to private companies. In addition to the gross violation of the right to adequate housing, agro-industry-induced displacement in Cambodia has led to widespread violations of numerous human rights and freedoms, such as forced eviction, reduced access to farming and grazing lands and the destruction of the forests which people depend upon for their livelihoods.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proper development of Cambodia’s land and natural resources could have a positive impact on the lives of its people if undertaken in a sustainable and equitable manner and within the framework of the human rights obligations of the government.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, some time ago I visited my fellow Democrat and friend Moso Koa from the Sam Rainsy Party in Cambodia. What I saw across the country was horrifying, and the images may remain with me forever. Countless families have fallen victim to the seizure of their homes and land. Both the government and major companies have seized land that these families have been cultivating for generations. The people affected have not received any compensation and have been left to fend for themselves. They now have no legal rights and are helpless.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU’s ‘Everything But Arms’ programme is essentially a good initiative; however, in reality it has had some very negative effects with regard to sugar and a number of other agricultural products, as the gigantic sugar companies have now taken over and are cultivating agricultural land. Countless settlements have been razed to the ground and thousands of families have been left homeless in order to make way for sugar plantations, which are taking advantage of the profitable agreement with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Therefore, I welcome the fact that the agreement contains an exhortation for an end to be put to all this, and an appeal to Cambodia to give the opposition leader Sam Rainsy the opportunity to return to his country before the election.</p>

The imprisonment of human rights activists, the silencing of perhaps the only independent media, and the illegal land grabbing and evictions clearly indicate that democratic values mean nothing to the Cambodian leadership. As Cambodia’s main supporter, the EU cannot stand idly by as the most brutal human rights violations take place in the country. The international community must call the Cambodian Government to account to ensure that the elections scheduled to take place in July 2013 are conducted democratically. Otherwise, we must review the EU-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement and the guarantees it sets out regarding trade preferences.</p>

As the single largest donor to Cambodia, the EU’s influence should weigh heavily upon Cambodia’s government. We must use this influence and urge Cambodia to change its election process and create an environment suitable for a free and fair election. A government that results from fraud and terror will always rule in terror and lies. Cambodia must end its practice of arbitrary arrest, detention and violence against peaceful protestors. We as a Union must ensure that Cambodia does not diverge from its path of progress.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in 1991 Cambodia signed the Paris Peace Agreement, in which it undertook to respect and protect human rights. Twenty-one years later, restrictions on freedom of expression, attacks on independent media and violence against human rights defenders are the order of the day in Cambodia. One example would be the arrest of the 13 women who organised a peaceful protest against their eviction in connection with a new spatial planning project in May of this year. The owner of a radio station and leader of the Association of Democrats in Cambodia has also been imprisoned for 20 years for allegedly revealing information on the repression of other opposition activists. The flagrant violations of human rights by the Cambodian authorities affect women, children and minority social groups.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of this situation, it would be appropriate to remind the Cambodian Government of its duty to meet its international obligations and implement the recommendations of the UN’s special envoy regarding political reforms. The latter include guaranteeing free and fair elections, with the participation of all citizens in exercising their democratic freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, preparations are under way in Cambodia for next year’s elections, and the EU, as the largest single donor and provider of development aid, now wishes to complain about the development of freedom of speech and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In relation to the previous elections in 2009, the EU election observers reported that the Cambodian elections did not satisfy the international criteria for democratic elections and called on the Government to reform several electoral practices. Even the UN recently set out recommendations and guidance on necessary reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another major problem is that, when freedom of speech also severely curtails political dialogue, there is no room for opposition parties to criticise even corruption or the management of land disputes. At the same time, official statistics are often secret, which obstructs public participation in political dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is now time for Cambodia to promote the principles of a State governed by the rule of law, to release the human rights activists it jailed in October and to tackle the arbitrary arrests and violence reported by human rights organisations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is unfortunately the case that the security forces in Cambodia continue to use excessive force against protesters, whether they are environmental or human rights activists or peaceful demonstrators. The case of the 14-year-old girl, Heng Chantha, shot dead by the security forces in May 2012, is particularly sad. There was not even an investigation into the circumstances of her death. Repression prevails and the rule of law is unknown.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is illustrated by the forced evictions. Sugar barons and companies are appropriating the land of Cambodian smallholders for the cultivation of sugar. One reason for this is the huge profit to be made from duty-free exports to Europe. We need action here and not just words. We should suspend the open trade policy for as long as forced evictions continue to take place in this country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the High Representative, Vice-President Catherine Ashton, I would like to thank the European Parliament for organising this debate. It is timely, given developments in the human rights situation which have been replicated in the past two years in Cambodia. Intimidation of journalists, human rights activists and peaceful demonstrators is on the rise, and court trials seem to fall short of basic judicial standards. The latest example has been the sentencing of human rights activist Mam Sonando on 1 October to a twenty-year jail term. This was criticised by the High Representative’s spokesperson in a statement underlining the lack of independence of the judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report on the human rights situation in Cambodia issued in July 2012 by UN Special rapporteur Professor Surya Subedi and his complementary report on the economic land concessions published on 24 September confirmed the seriousness of the situation. There is a narrowing space for people from civil society, including those belonging to different political parties, to express their views peacefully and without fear. This is particularly relevant in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in July 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Land disputes and forced evictions lead to violence and social instability and are becoming a major political problem. The EU has raised its concerns in relation to the allocation of economic land concessions with the Cambodian authorities in a number of high-level meetings, most recently the EU-Cambodia Joint Committee in June. In April this year, Commissioner De Gucht also discussed the issue at length with his Cambodian counterpart Cham Prasidh. President Van Rompuy’s visit to Cambodia from 2 to 4 November will be an opportunity to take up these issues. He will meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen and the President of the National Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cambodia is still recovering from its dark and violent past; positive steps are being taken towards democratisation and the economy has been growing well, but the Kingdom has still a long way to go on its path to democracy and a fair sharing of the economic growth dividend. The EU has supported, and will continue to support, Cambodia’s democratic transition, and through the EU-Cambodia Cooperation Facility for Governance and Human Rights it has committed EUR 7.5 million to support the extraordinary chambers of the courts of Cambodia and strengthen the Cambodian Human Rights Committee. 60 other projects have been funded since 2003 for a total of EUR 15.5 million under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, primarily supporting land rights and indigenous peoples’ rights, freedom of expression and prison conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is exploring the possibility of an election experts’ mission to follow the preparation of the parliamentary elections next July. It will continue to call on the authorities to create an environment conducive to free and fair elections where the voter, the candidate and the commentator can exert their basic political rights. The EU will continue to pay particular attention to the human rights situation linked to economic land concessions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In 2006, I had the opportunity to lead a mission to Cambodia to assess the democratic changes in that country. During the mission, among other things, we saw that the functioning of the judiciary was a weak link in the system. The Cambodian people were waiting for the establishment of a Khmer Rouge Tribunal. Although that Tribunal was set up in 2006, it does not seem to be functioning efficiently. Indeed, it is facing financial problems, which is slowing down the hearings because it cannot afford the staff it needs to function. Moreover, many international organisations have made numerous accusations of political interference in the Tribunal by the Cambodian regime. In addition to the cases of restrictions on freedom of expression, as a member of the EP’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am particularly appalled at the numerous cases of displacement of the population and dispossession of land for economic gain. Many land rights campaigners have already been detained in Cambodian prisons. It is time for Cambodia to show better respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">It is my honour to announce that the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2012 has been awarded by unanimous decision of the Conference of Presidents, and on behalf of all Members, to Ms Nasrin Sotoudeh and Mr Jafar Panahi of Iran.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">With this award, we voice our solidarity with, and our admiration for, a woman and a man who have both defied fear and intimidation in Iran and decided to put their country’s fate ahead of their own.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Nasrin Sotoudeh has placed herself in the frontline in the battle for legal protection for human rights campaigners, journalists and opposition activists. On account of her courageous and noble actions, she was snatched away from her family and sentenced on charges of spreading anti-regime propaganda and harming national security to 11 years in prison.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, if the battle for freedom, if the battle for human rights, for personal dignity, for freedom from torture and the death penalty, for freedom of opinion and for justice in court proceedings represents an attack on national security, then we support these people in their attack on the national security of a regime that has no regard for any of these rights. The prize awarded to Ms Sotoudeh is also a resounding rejection of the Iranian regime.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, Jafar Panahi is one of the best-known and most internationally renowned Iranian film directors. His films are a lively portrait of a complex, rich and beautiful country and its people. As with every good portrait, this man shows not only the merits but also the complexities and the everyday problems of Iranians. Let us be clear: political regimes fear nothing more than the depiction of the bitter reality of life under their rule. That means that people like Mr Panahi have to be silenced.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Both Ms Sotoudeh and Mr Panahi stand for everything for which the European Union also stands, and we say to them loud and clear: you are not alone. I desperately hope that they will be able to travel to Strasbourg in December to receive their prize in this Chamber. I call on the Iranian authorities to do everything possible to allow that to happen.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to thank all Members in this House who have played a part in the organisation of the Sakharov Prize this year. I would also like to stress that, having sat in this Chamber since 1994 and been involved, since then, in every award of the Sakharov Prize, in various capacities, I have never known the Conference of Presidents to be unanimous in its decision on the winner of the Sakharov Prize, without entertaining any other suggestion. It took about three minutes this morning to reach this decision, and I can remember the debates we had on previous occasions. That shows, ladies and gentlemen, that there is an overwhelming desire within this House to award the prize to Ms Sotoudeh and Mr Panahi. Once again, I offer my sincere congratulations to the winners.</p>

It is essential to strike a balance between the need for transparency and monitoring, and a sufficient level of effectiveness and speed of implementation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The introduction of such instruments at European level is, however, highly important, as it is a way of enabling the European Union, especially in times of crisis, to stimulate investment in the real economy in a way that is in line with its objectives at a time when, against the background of a constant fall in the volume of resources allocated to its budget, its political ambitions are steadily growing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in recent years, various European institutions have used innovative financial instruments to manage their budgets in these times of fiscal discipline. Using innovative financial instruments includes combining grants by using public and/or private funds to maximise the potential for achieving objectives. While they remain an innovative tool for agency budgets, they pose a challenge in regulating and monitoring the use of these funds. We have to ask ourselves who these individuals are and why are they donating their money in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must take certain preventive measures to prevent corruption and all other backdoor deals. One such measure entails the Commission installing management and control systems. Preventing corruption and other market abuses is vital to the economy, especially in these hard times.

Innovative financial instruments are still a crucial tool for growth and investment in the economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">What struck me was that it became clear that the European Ombudsman and Parliament’s Committee on Petitions dovetail nicely with each other and make a good combination. Each one depends on the other; each one complements the other. Where, in politics, you usually expect to find conflicts of competence, here that is not the case. With regard to the current parliamentary term at least, I can say that we complement each other wonderfully and provide mutual assistance.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this report aims to reintroduce a greater degree of regulation to the financial markets. We have discovered in recent years that deregulation and liberalisation lead to crises, to a rampant increase in national debt that we are now forced to tackle, with a great deal of effort and a great deal of money. Liberalisation as a dogma has not proved a success.</p>
      <p sl="de">The financial institutions began to plunder entire countries, driving them into a debt trap. That is ultimately one of the principal causes of the problems we are now facing. I would like at this point just to mention Goldman Sachs, a financial institution that has, for instance, unleashed disaster in Greece, with which the entire European Union is currently grappling.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is high time for us to ensure that the financial economy is again bound by clear regulations. It is high time for us to reintroduce rules; it has been proven here that it was wrong to liberalise too early and too much.</p>

Unfortunately, that has been made very clear to us in the case of the financial market. That was a game without rules. We tried to reassure ourselves a little by saying: ‘Of what interest are stock market transactions to us? Of what interest is the financial market to us? That has nothing to do with the real economy. That has nothing to do with public finances’.</p>
      <p sl="de">We then made the painful realisation that when prices fall, errors are made or bankruptcies occur in this sector, it evidently does have consequences for the real economy and for public finances, as, ultimately, we are inextricably linked to the world and the market and are consequently all in the same boat. It is therefore very important that, politically, too, we are finally able to impose restrictions and establish rules.

This can allow the City of London, which is within my constituency and which I proudly represent, to market its services across the EU and create a levelling of the playing field for all businesses needing to raise capital and for investors to invest in it.

With regard to derivatives traded between countries, involving covered and naked short selling, we have made the painful discovery that errors must be addressed where they have occurred. I am naturally one of those who say that we should impose even more regulation. Even more needs to be done to address the situation, not just in Europe but also among our global competitors. However, it was easy for me to support this report, as it is an important step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support this piece of legislation. The recent financial crisis has exposed several weaknesses within the multinational economic framework. In order to correct these, the present sustainable development and cooperation strategy should include the proposals outlined in the amendments to the Commission’s draft.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, one proposal involves greater transparency and more oversight of less-regulated markets. The intention of this proposal is to develop effective competition between the trading of financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to eliminate trade barriers and discriminatory trade practices. By abolishing these obstacles, the market system will decrease risk, better protect investors and increase the efficiency of the financial markets. It will also reduce unnecessary costs for investors and participants.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recession is far from over in Europe. Since 2008, the European Union has lost more than 25 million jobs. Increasing disparity in wages has slowed growth and the lack of integration has hurt competitiveness. I am voting for this report in an attempt to bring about the end of the current debt crisis and lay a foundation that will prevent another crisis from happening in the future. We must continue forward and ensure that Member States comply with the European Strategy for Growth and Jobs laid out in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union must have stronger coordination between its Member States for the purposes of budgetary and economic policy and certainly, in my view, we need a single budgetary and economic and fiscal policy.

      <p sl="fi">On this point, I want to emphasise that it is very important that we ensure proper implementation in the Member States; and it is clear that, over the past few years, even the large Member States, such as Germany and France, have missed the headline targets. It is important for the countries to abide by the recommendations they have given, but it is especially good that the target advocated by some representatives and even the European Parliament from time to time has not been met, namely the signature of a stricter agreement on economic discipline by all 25 Member States or even all 27, and I can say that the fewer agreements there are in addition to the Treaties, the better.

That also means refraining from unwarranted interference in internal Russian affairs. No country I know is as sensitive to the interference of outsiders, in particular the European Union institutions, as Russia. Russia is not a country of children. The Russians are quite capable of organising their own judiciary and are not necessarily in need of advice from the EU.

      <p sl="fi">In our debates here, for example, we have raised the Khodorkovsky case, and, in my view, the European Union should have the courage to tackle issues of this nature more vigorously. If we look at Russia and Belarus, we can see that both have exactly the same policy, both have exactly the same attitude towards human rights issues, but regardless of that fact, we have the courage to talk big to Belarus but not to Russia, and on this matter we should have the same attitude toward all countries.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, every single principle of freedom and democracy has been stifled under the rule of President Alexander Lukashenko. The law has been violated in every election in Belarus during the last 17 years. During the September elections, a range of illegal methods were again used. These included discriminating against the opposition and limiting its involvement in electoral commissions, censuring election material and numerous irregularities, including inflation of the turnout figures. In view of all of this, the parliament that emerged still cannot be deemed to represent the will of the people. Consequently, Belarus cannot be seen as a credible partner for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore appeal to the authorities in Minsk to re-run the parliamentary elections, ensuring that next time they are free and fair. I call on President Lukashenko to stop attacking the opposition, to free political prisoners and journalists, to ensure that non-governmental organisations can carry out their activities without restrictions, and to ensure the free flow of information. To this end, we must also provide wide-ranging support for the activities of Belarusian civil society, using instruments such as the Telewizja Bielsat television channel.</p>

The elections were very well organised and transparent, leaving aside certain minor problems. President Saakashvili demonstrated that he is a politician who values democracy and the will of the people. This was very important in that rather tough year. The former opposition will have to learn to show respect for its opponent and I am alluding to the fact, that following the elections, the leader of the opposition, Bidzina Ivanishvili, immediately proposed that the Georgian President resign.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Most importantly, the European Union should continue to pay significant attention to Georgia and its new government should maintain the course and dynamics of the reforms.

Furthermore, it is noted that the Commission does not expect that the end of mutual recognition will negatively impact manufacturers who participate in the EU programme as they tend to focus almost entirely on the EU market.

Under the new agreement, there will be two separate product registration systems in the EU, which maintains self-certification by manufacturers, and the US, which decided to move to third-party certification. Consequently, the principle of mutual recognition will no longer be applicable. Furthermore, provisions regarding the respective responsibilities of the Commission and the Member States in the enforcement of the programme were clarified. There are no other substantial changes in relation to the current text, hence my vote.</p>

On the contrary, an IFI may generate proceeds that can be reinvested (reflows) in the fund concerned, thereby strengthening its multiplier effect. The European Parliament strongly defends this principle. Unfortunately, the Council is more reluctant. The new Financial Regulation due to be adopted in October 2012 (Grässle/Rivellini report) should facilitate the use of reflows. However, concrete measures will have to be determined.

Since the early part of the last decade, the EU institutions have developed a series of innovative financial instruments (IFIs) based on arrangements combining grants from the Union budget with public and/or private funding in order to boost the volume of investment available to achieve the Union’s strategic objectives. However, in the last decade public investment in the EU has been falling steadily, and this trend has become more pronounced since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. In order to achieve the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU will need massive investment over the next decade and it is therefore essential to properly exploit the potential of these IFIs by attracting private sector funding.

It is important to point out that in the area of internal Union policies, IFIs are implemented either at European level (managed by the Commission itself or a body authorised by it) or at national level in the context of regional and cohesion policy (managed jointly with the Member States).

In fact, to stimulate economic growth and job creation, we need more support for small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can become more innovative and competitive and embark upon a process of internationalisation.

FIs are no more than instruments for transferring funds that were public (such as the Cohesion Fund) into the financial (and speculative) sphere. The majority of the European Parliament wants to go even further than we have until now, extending their application to ‘projects, project groups or parts of project programmes that will generate income and profits’ through public-private partnerships (public funding and private profit). These instruments and the funds that will be attached to them – the Commission estimates that EUR 1 600 billion will be needed between now and 2020 to fund the seven thematic initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy – will be used to finance large infrastructure projects, which will serve to consolidate the ‘single market’ and its beneficiaries. At the same time, the direct participation of EU capital in infrastructure-sector projects is being advocated. In addition to the chronic shortage of funds in the EU budget, new risks are now emerging, such as even more unequal distribution of the Union’s resources and (even greater) impairment of the cohesion objectives.</p>

The ultimate purpose of, and the rationale for, the financial instruments is that they should act in situations of market failure or suboptimal investment as a catalyst that makes it possible, on the basis of a contribution from the Union budget, to mobilise funding – public and/or private – for projects that can secure no support, or only inadequate support, from the market.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The IFIs developed thus far have been used to carry out an extremely wide variety of interventions, ranging from the taking of stakes in equity/venture capital funds to the provision of guarantees/counter-guarantees to financial intermediaries, via the creation, jointly with financial institutions, of risk-sharing instruments in order to stimulate investment, innovation and research.

In this way, state intervention may reduce the costs of potential risks or partly shoulder such costs, thus facilitating the implementation of these plans. As regards the design of new financial instruments, I agree about the importance of a preliminary assessment to identify market weaknesses or sub-optimal investments, and also that a range of simple qualitative indicators for ex-ante and ex-post assessment needs to be specified.

It is therefore a body to which citizens are turning more and more frequently, and one that is increasingly justifying its existence and demonstrating its usefulness.</p>

      <p sl="ro">While European citizens and decision-makers from the Member States continue to debate the integration process, a high level of decision-making and institutional transparency must be maintained by the European Union. The European Ombudsman is the sole actor capable of ensuring EU openness and rapid communication between European citizens and the institutions. I support the adoption of the 2011 report on the European Ombudsman. Given that most complaints to the European Ombudsman – 61 % – were submitted electronically, it is important for the European Union as a whole, and the Ombudsman in particular, to promote the internet as a direct and transparent means of communication with citizens. It is equally important for the Ombudsman to continue its close cooperation with the European Parliament, the Member States and the European Commission.</p>

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility for EU citizens to apply to the Ombudsman when EU institutions or bodies fail to act in accordance with rules or principles that are binding upon them and go against the principles of good administration. In 2011 the European Ombudsman helped more than 22 000 citizens. A decline in the number of complaints received each year has also been observed. I believe that the effective work of the Ombudsman and opportunities for EU citizens to defend their legitimate demands is one of the main ways of promoting citizens’ trust in the European civil service and the EU institutions.

      <p sl="pt">The European Ombudsman is empowered to receive complaints concerning maladministration in the activities of Union institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies. On 22 May 2012, he presented his Annual Report for 2011, which notes that he helped more than 22 000 citizens, of whom 2 510 submitted complaints, 1 284 requested information and 18 274 obtained advice through the interactive guide. The significant reduction in requests for information received over the last few years demonstrates the success of the interactive guide. It is also worth highlighting that the number of inquiries that the Ombudsman opened concerning the European Parliament dropped significantly compared to 2010. Despite some success, the quantity of complaints processed in 2011 was again relatively modest (around 27 %) and provision should therefore be made for more comprehensive and proactive public awareness-raising. All European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies are called upon to act in accordance with the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, and the Ombudsman must continue to ensure the best possible use of resources. The ability of EU citizens to enjoy their rights fully, in particular the right to complain, appears to be essential to the accomplishment of the European project.

The average length of the inquiries was 10 months. In addition to these complaints, 1 284 people requested information and 18 274 obtained advice via the interactive guide on the Ombudsman’s website.

It now covers possible instances of maladministration within the common foreign and security policy, including the Common Security and Defence Policy. The main types of alleged maladministration have been matters of illegality, including refusal to provide information, bias, unsatisfactory procedures, avoidable delays, discrimination and replies by letter in a language other than that of the complainants.

The rising number of complaints also reflects the fact that the European Ombudsman now has the competence to act in response to maladministration and illegal behaviour without maladministration being automatically restricted to unlawful activity.

This means that EU citizens have become more aware of the Ombudsman’s mandate – particularly owing to the clearer information communicated by the Ombudsman and making the procedures more citizen-friendly, which has contributed to the increased number of inquiries.

The texts deal with various aspects of the structure of the financial markets, the instruments and the participants, and in my view represent a very important step towards increasing transparency and guaranteeing a good price formation process on the European stock exchanges. We must ensure that transparency requirements for high-frequency trading firms are increased, so that everyone is aware of their technical trading. Another very important issue is that of ‘commodities’ and agricultural derivatives: this is an important political matter and it is crucial to establish provisions to reduce speculation in food markets. There must therefore be more transparency requirements and more stringent rules on the rights of asset managers in relation to their clients, and strict limitations must be imposed on the practice of ‘incentivisation’. With regard to this last point, Member States will have the option to ban incentives. This text makes a good commitment and constitutes a strong starting point for negotiations with the Council.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this Directive, which aims to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent, and to strengthen the protection of investors. In force since November 2007, the original Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) governs the provision of investment services in financial instruments (brokerage, advice, dealing, portfolio management, underwriting, etc.) by banks and investment firms and the operation of traditional stock exchanges and alternative trading venues (so-called multilateral trading facilities). While MiFID created competition between these services and brought more choice and lower prices for investors, shortcomings were exposed in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2009 the G20 agreed at the Pittsburgh summit on the need to improve the transparency and oversight of less regulated markets – including derivatives markets – and to address the issue of excessive price volatility in commodity derivatives markets. I agree that we need to establish more robust and efficient market structures, and greater supervisory powers and controls for these markets, and ensure better protection for consumers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), in force since November 2007, is one of the EU’s cornerstones of the integration of financial markets in the EU. The main objective is to deepen the integration, competitiveness and effectiveness of the EU’s financial markets. The ability of Member States to require all trading in financial instruments to take place in traditional stock exchanges has gone and it is now possible to have Europe-wide commercial competition between these stock exchanges and alternative trading venues. Banks and investment companies would be more ‘entitled’ to provide investment services within the EU if they adhere to the organisational and reporting requirements and the comprehensive rules intended to protect investors.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, it is also true that the more competitive scenario has resulted in new challenges. The advantages of greater commercial competition have not benefited all market participants equally and have not always been passed on to the end retail or non-retail investors. In the final analysis, although the comprehensive MiFID rules largely acquitted themselves well during the financial crisis, there is a need for specific, but ambitious improvement. I believe that the amendment of the MiFID represents an integral part of the reforms intended to create a safer, more reliable, transparent and responsible financial system, which, in a period marked by the consequences of the financial crisis, will operate to the benefit of the economy and society as a whole.</p>

We have done this because we believe there is a need for updated and improved legislation in connection with this, particularly through greater transparency and openness. However, there are three areas that we continue to remain sceptical of. The first concerns competition between clearing houses in connection with a completed transaction. As the proposal is currently worded, there is a risk that competition may be restricted, which would be to the detriment of both the way in which the market functions and individual investors. The second matter concerns the trading of commodity-related instruments, concerning which more restrictions are being introduced which could have an adverse effect on pricing. Finally, the third matter concerns high-frequency trading, where the current formulation of the proposal aims to regulate technical development rather than any elements of market abuse that could arise in the wake of this development.

Our proposal sought to put an end to the incentives financial advisers receive for placing junk products with consumers who are not investors.

In this way, financial advisers would have been forced to recommend products that benefited their clients, not increased their own revenue.

There will thus be regulation of organised trading facilities (OTF), which are playing an increasingly active role in these markets, and a decision is being made on the creation of a private label for capital markets, especially those aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises, to facilitate their access to alternative financing. These proposals will provide greater transparency in the financial markets, strengthen the role and power of national supervisors and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and make investment institutions more responsible and accountable through the introduction of corporate governance principles. Finally, I would like to congratulate Markus Ferber and I support his conclusions on this important matter.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report in question, prepared by Markus Ferber, focuses on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Financial Instruments and amending the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) on over-the-counter derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. At present, after much having been said and written about the actual cause of the current economic and financial crisis, the conclusion is unanimous: financial speculation! To prevent such a crisis in the future, it is becoming urgent to adopt measures and implement rules that promote security and transparency in financial transactions and offer guarantees to investors. There is no doubt that financial markets are necessary, but they must be secure and transparent. To achieve this, it is necessary to address all the existing shortcomings. I therefore welcome the safeguard clause, which will protect citizens. For many years, the financial markets have been working for the benefit of themselves and their institutions and not for the benefit of the real economy. I voted in favour of this proposal because it refocuses the financial markets on the real economy, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, making the financial sector more credible and guaranteeing greater protection for the rights of consumers and investors.</p>

In essence, the products and mechanisms that make financial speculation possible remain in place. Under the pretext of providing greater regulation, this set of recommendations for legal harmonisation ends up ensuring that the financial markets have the necessary fluidity to keep operating in the same way as they have up to now. The substantive issues that would have been addressed if the intention was, in fact, to curb and impose limits on financial speculation, remain untouched. In essence, despite some apparently correct measures, the conditions are being maintained to ensure the stability of financial operators and the continuation of the whole circuit that drains added value from the productive sectors and into financial capital. The costs involved in the movement of various financial products are being harmonised and reduced, creating an illusion of greater regulation and supervision which is, at root, false. There is, for example, no mention at all of tax havens, banking secrecy or countries with tax regimes that are ‘friendly’ to big finance, either in this or other legislative proposals.</p>

The new legislation should, as a consequence, consist of two different legal instruments, a directive and this Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that both instruments should form the legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, regulated markets and data reporting services providers.

Self-regulation of intermediaries has also proved disastrous, shaking the very concept of market to the core. I would therefore like to emphasise the importance of a single set of rules to govern all financial institutions, in order to provide legal certainty and to simplify existing regulations. The financial crisis is also, if not above all, a crisis of trust, and trust needs to be rebuilt with rules, transparency and justice.

Clearing houses will increasingly concentrate on the risks previously posed by banks involved in over-the-counter trading. Only clearing houses with bank status will fall within the supervisory remit of the European Central Bank. There, too, it is a question of applying the principle of identical supervision for identical activities, and thus eventually including all clearing houses in the scope of the single supervisory mechanism.

      <p sl="pt">This report drafted by Jean-Paul Gauzès focuses on the European Semester for the coordination of economic policies, in particular with regard to the accomplishment of the priorities set for the year 2012. The European Semester is an exceptional tool for the coordination and articulation of economic goals between Member States and the European Union in a spirit of cooperation that does not call national sovereignty into question. The Members of the European Parliament do not wish to interfere in national parliaments. Their roles are different. I hope that the Commission follows the recommendations of this report and brings its position into line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, on which all our efforts should be focused so as to ensure that the ‘European Semester’ is not merely an alert mechanism, but a form of effective collaboration between the EP and national parliaments ensuring a balance between income and expenditure. I voted in favour of this report assessing European economic governance and I call upon the Member States to abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report adopted heaps extensive praise on the European Semester, indicating the nature of the political forces that hold the majority in this Parliament. It is a process that aims to do nothing more than coordinate an attack on the rights and living conditions of workers and peoples throughout the European Union. The report ‘acknowledges the Commission’s emphasis on labour market reforms with a view to increasing the competitiveness of the euro area’ and ‘considers that wage increases should be kept in line with productivity’. What should be highlighted here is the total collusion of the social democrats – the so-called ‘socialists’ and ‘greens’ – in this regression of civilisation and this dangerous attack on democracy. It is illuminating to read the amendments, which attempt to add a few ‘social’ touches to the profoundly reactionary edifice of the ‘European Semester’, but end up legitimising not only the process that led to it but also its content. They are profoundly anti-democratic, showing contempt for the will and participation of the people and, behind citizens’ backs, taking away all powers from the power structures that are close to them and which they control (better), namely the national parliaments, in an intolerable attack on the sovereignty of each country and its people.</p>

The current economic situation has demonstrated that stronger coordination between Member States’ macroeconomic and budgetary policies is needed in order to achieve a more integrated and balanced economic union. The increasing disparities in competitiveness since the introduction of the euro have highlighted the need for enhanced coordination of economic and employment policies and improved budgetary practices.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Council is firmly committed to mobilising, at every level of governance in the EU, all levers, instruments and policies to stimulate smart, sustainable, inclusive, resource-efficient and job-creating growth. All the measures proposed for this problem should help to achieve sound and sustainable public finances, minimise macroeconomic imbalances and boost competitiveness that may help lead to higher growth and employment. I am of the view that there is a need for stronger cohesion within and among the different Member States’ recommendations, for better use of the macroeconomic scoreboard and for account to be taken of the negative effects of individual Member States’ economic policies.</p>

The report calls for a greater legitimacy in the whole process by better involving the EP. This is a measure that should have been taken a long time ago. In the field of employment, the report specifies that Member States should combat the existence and proliferation of non-decent labour contracts and false self-employment and ensure that people with temporary or part-time contracts or who are self-employed have adequate social protection and access to training and, when feasible, advanced training, and implement related framework agreements. In the field of the budget, the report urges the Council, during negotiations on the 2013 EU budget, to accept a political and public debate on the level of appropriations needed to implement the ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’ adopted at the June 2012 European Council.

In this regard, it is appropriate that on the ninth anniversary of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest we raise concerns about Russia’s trustworthiness as a trading partner.

This is the neoliberal playbook in all its splendour; the big finance agenda of the EU, which wants to reduce the import costs of products that are, in many cases, crucial to the industry of many EU countries. Russia, like any other country, has the right to exercise sovereignty over its natural resources and to impose the export duties it deems most appropriate to its own interests, regardless of the WTO’s provisions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Last December, after 18 years of negotiations, the Russian Federation became a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This resolution covers some guidelines for trade relations between the European Union and Russia, emphasising certain key points with which I am in complete agreement. Firstly, these relations should be based on the principle of reciprocity that should apply in a wide variety of contexts, from access to public contracts, to recognition of intellectual property rights and protection of origin marking and quality marking in the agricultural sector. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, especially with regard to energy supply.

      <p sl="lt">I supported the European Parliament resolution, which expresses concern that having joined the WTO, Russia is not in a hurry to enforce its commitments. Russia and the EU need each other as trade partners and, therefore, when Russia joined the WTO following 18 years of negotiations, the EU welcomed Russia’s achievement as a new incentive for growth and expansion of the country’s economy. Unfortunately, in reality, there are examples where expectations have not been met. Used car exporters, for instance, reasonably expected a higher volume of trade at lower prices, but when Russia introduced the ‘utilisation fee’ on 1 September, car exports became even more difficult than prior to WTO membership. Energy resources constitute Russia’s main exports to the EU, whereas the EU exports a wide range of products to Russia. The European Commission identified 300 products that are subject to import duties that do not comply with WTO commitments. Experience with the Energy Charter Treaty, for example, shows that Russia can be selective in complying with its commitments. In that case, Russia lost a major court case involving Yukos in an international arbitration tribunal because of its failure to respect its commitments. I believe that the European Parliament’s signal to Russia is necessary and timely.</p>

The temporary bans, unilateral temporary tariff increases and protectionist measures and barriers to open and fair trade must be removed.

      <p sl="en">The elections in Belarus under the Lukashenko regime have been, and continue to be, a complete farce. They do not come close to democratic standards. The old Soviet-style tactics of this dictatorship are best exemplified by the fact that a number of students and employees of state-owned companies were forced to take part in early voting which started five days before election day. It is evident that these individuals would be fired from their work or thrown out of their university if they refused to take part in this charade. It is unfortunate that Belarus cannot take part in the Euronest PA, but, bearing in mind the complete lack of transparency of these elections, we would have to have a total disregard for our values to allow the undemocratically-elected parliamentarians of Belarus to sit at the Euronest table.</p>

      <p sl="cs">As is now customary, motions for resolutions relating to Belarus put forward by the different political groupings in the European Parliament differ greatly. I do not wish to enter into debate on the individual points contained in motions other than this one put forward by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I should just like to emphasise the importance of a passage in paragraph four of our motion, expressing preoccupation about the diplomatic conflict between EU Member States and Belarus. I am genuinely convinced that the Union’s confrontational approach to Belarus is not only damaging international relations, but is not helping anti-government opposition either. If we are incapable of expressing an interest in and seeking common paths to compromise, then our support for opposition activities, not just through resolutions, will only serve as evidence of interference with the sovereignty of Belarus and an attack on the convictions and interests of those who supported the current leadership of Belarus in elections.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to point out that our confrontational approach not only has no effect but may also result in a whole range of quite unacceptable escalations. These escalations might have an altogether different purpose than that of helping the Belarusian opposition and might, for example, complicate the integration processes in the post-Soviet area. As demonstrated by the situation in Libya and Syria, this may lead to the use of resources other than resolutions and street demonstrations. I therefore request that, as an extremely valuable part of our proposed amendments, we eliminate the mutual prejudices.</p>

The parliamentary elections in Belarus failed to meet international democratic standards. A free election means that the people are free to express themselves, organise themselves and seek a mandate, but we saw none of that during the campaign. Moreover, the electoral authorities lacked ‘impartiality’ and the counting of the votes was questionable, to say the least. The elections took place in an environment that makes free elections almost impossible. Political prisoners are still locked up and opponents were prevented from standing as candidates. It is very clear that, rather than accepting the partnership with Europe that he has been offered, President Lukashenko has instead opted for a policy of repression.</p>

President Lukashenko’s regime is also demonstrating its inability to deal with human rights and fundamental freedoms by preventing the development of a politically participative civil society and by constantly censoring the media.

After gaining independence from the USSR in 1991, it experienced a great deal of instability. The current Georgian regime, established by President Saakashvili, has manifested its desire to join the European Union and is trying to position itself as pro-Western. However, it has not escaped criticism from institutions such as Freedom House, which considers the country only ‘partly free’. Separatism lies at the heart of its dispute with Russia. This issue still has to be resolved and tensions continue, as do mutual accusations of human rights violations. Transfers of power in countries whose democratic institutions and processes are still in the consolidation phase always entail risks and unknowns that can only be avoided and clarified through the civic maturity of the people and, in particular, of party leaders. Despite the difficulties and the need to address some issues, the Georgians have met international electoral standards and are well on the path to democracy and freedom that they want to follow.

Therefore I supported today’s resolution on Georgia.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Members of the European Parliament wished to welcome the significant progress made in the election process during Georgia’s parliamentary elections, but it is also important to note that there are still some shortcomings. There was visible progress in the area of freedoms in particular, allowing for very active and dynamic participation by the citizens and a campaign that was contested, even if it was polarised. We always have to show strong support for the promotion of democracy and reforms in Georgia. That will be possible if those elected, be they in government or in the opposition parties, exercise their democratic privileges in a responsible manner and continue to make progress on the reforms, for the benefit of the Georgian people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The recent elections in Georgia, held on 1 October 2012, constituted a historic milestone as they were the first to be held in an entirely fair and free environment. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe considered that the elections were a step towards consolidating democracy in Georgia. The results provide Georgia with an opportunity to cooperate even more closely with the European Union and NATO. However, there will have to be understanding and respect between the parties in Georgia, especially on the part of the defeated opposition. There is still a long way to go to consolidate democratic values in this country of the Caucasus, so the European Union must continue to support the reforms that still have to be completed there. In light of the above, I congratulate Georgia and I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the Georgian elections because I believe that the Georgian people took a significant step towards the consolidation of democracy with the democratic elections of 1 October, which were conducted in line with OSCE and Council of Europe commitments.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the Georgian Government’s commitment to further Euro-Atlantic integration and its determination to build on the results of the good work done by the previous authorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Council and the Commission to ensure the necessary support for the new administration and to continue the ongoing dialogue, so as to ensure continuity and maintain momentum in the negotiations for an Association Agreement. This should be considered in line with the principle of ‘more for more’ to redouble the efforts to complete the negotiations for a visa-free regime between Georgia and the EU, in the context of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. A good relationship between Georgia and the EU will contribute to economic development in the Black Sea region.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour, as one of the EU’s foreign policy goals is to enhance relations with Georgia. We should try to ensure that the new government continues to cooperate with us. The support Georgia has hitherto received from the European Union concerning the former’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should also be maintained. It is vital for the new government to continue combating corruption and for it to implement the political reforms initiated by the current government. We should support Georgia as it takes its next steps towards greater democracy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">For a considerable time, under President Saakashvili’s leadership, Georgia has been moving towards democracy. The recent elections confirm that trend. The opposition’s victory was a meaningful signal in support of that view. Unfortunately, it seems that victory has been accompanied by a return of the demons that last appeared in Georgia during the Rose Revolution. A situation in which the successful opposition makes every effort to increase its victory by exerting pressure or rigging elections cannot be allowed. Not only is the new Prime Minister making derogatory statements about the hitherto pro-European policy of the President, but he is also leaning towards Russia rather than strengthening links with Europe. I hope that the Prime Minister will soon reconsider his actions and redefine his foreign policy in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This resolution, which ‘celebrates’ the outcome of the elections in Georgia and the step forward that the elections represents, glosses over a number of facts about the country that ought to have embarrassed those who produced and/or supported it. It obscures the neoliberal measures that have destroyed the guarantees and social rights of workers, and the privatisation of all spheres of the economy. What the majority of the European Parliament wishes to do is to gloss over what is happening in this country (a situation to which the European Union, NATO, the United States and the big finance organisations (International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organisation, etc.) have contributed greatly), support the conclusion of a ‘free trade agreement’ and bring Georgia closer to NATO. For the majority of the EP, any means are acceptable to achieve geostrategic domination of this country, and get their hands on the important resources throughout the region and the energy supply guarantees on which the EU is dependent. The actions of internal and external players in this country and in the Caucasus – a region full of tension – are sustaining great instability that may generate new sources of conflict.</p>
