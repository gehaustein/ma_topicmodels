      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Anne Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes (2007/2203(INI)) (A6-0040/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-010" speaker_id="5735" name="Anne Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions for their valuable assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today we can be satisfied with the balanced report adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is the result of joint efforts. The European Union is unquestionably committed to the environment, both internally and at international level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having set a number of objectives in order to meet the urgent environmental needs facing us, the European Union has to devise ways of achieving them. To do that, it has, over the years, adopted legislation that is regularly revised and applicable in the Union. It invests in research, raises public awareness and encourages good practice by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now we are suggesting looking at another possibility, that of market-based instruments. The report is based on the Commission paper, which contains a number of proposals and ideas that I welcome. Firstly, it endeavours to improve on a text that, in my view, focuses a little too much on climate change. That is certainly a crucial issue, but we must not ignore the whole picture, all the fields of human activity whose impact on the environment is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I did not, unfortunately have any information from the consultation that might have helped us in our work. In the Green Paper, the Commission is proposing to achieve the environmental targets at a lower and a reasonable cost. That should be possible with the economic instruments which are, moreover, a flexible way of achieving the aims set.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the report suggests that the Commission should draw up an action plan or other system for a market-based instrument for the environment. I have a question for the Commission: can it tell us what stage it has reached in its discussions and whether the consultation results available to it at the moment will reinforce or amend the proposals in the Green Paper? I believe that is a very important question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the implementation of the market-based instruments, we must be guided by certain principles. We must, of course, apply the 'polluter pays' principle, ensure that the market-based instruments complement each other and complement other instruments, and that they are consistent and appropriate to the areas covered. That is the aim. In other words, we must not be systematic, but must show a great deal of ingenuity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to specific instruments, which I do not have time to discuss here, I must emphasise that Parliament is sceptical about the proposal on biodiversity, for the simple reason that it seems to us difficult, if not impossible, to compensate for a fairly unusual ecosystem in another country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for internalisation of the costs, that is a principle on which we have to base ourselves and for which we have to take steps. At the moment, very little account is taken of the environmental costs of human activities, particularly industrial and economic activities, in other words, to use a more technical term, the external costs. The transport sector is a typical example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note that last June the Commission was to put forward a proposal for revision of the 'Eurovignette' directive, particularly by making the road transport charge variable. That principle of variability must be applied more and more when devising market-based instruments for the environment. The Commission is proposing a similar system for energy taxes, in which they would be made up of two components, an energy component and an environmental component.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the revision of the directive achieves its purpose, it should also ensure that competitiveness with other means of transport is restored and that modes that emit less CO2 are used.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there is one point to which I should like to draw particular attention: the competitiveness of the European economy. Of course we agree on this, but we have to be careful. The question that arises here is whether inaction would have a social, economic and environmental cost, as well as a political cost.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, its rapporteurs for its very constructive reaction to the Commission’s Green Paper on market-based instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, this Green Paper was presented together with Commissioner Dimas with the purpose of launching a broad public debate on advancing the use of market-based instruments for environment and energy-related policy purposes in the Community. The Green Paper starts from the broadly shared view that not only market-based instruments, such as taxes, charges and tradable permit schemes, but also targeted subsidies, provide a flexible and cost-efficient means of reaching given policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that Parliament supports this approach. Equally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the view that market-based instruments cannot be seen and used in isolation and should be combined with regulatory instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s report is a very useful and very comprehensive contribution to the discussion about the use of market-based instruments, both at Community and national level. Its scope is even broader, covering issues such as the greening of gross domestic product and the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. While these issues are obviously linked to the subject of the Green Paper and highly important in their own right, they were left out of the Green Paper, as they were covered in other Commission documents elaborated in parallel.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will take account of the numerous comments and requests made by Parliament in the context of its work on the various issues mentioned in the Green Paper and on further specific initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as imminent actions foreseen for this year are concerned, I can inform you that the Commission is planning to revise the Energy Taxation Directive in the autumn with the objective of ensuring that it contributes more effectively to meeting the EU energy and climate change targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, and in line with the request of Parliament, one of the main aspects will be to achieve better complementarity with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In my view, it is very important to provide for the best possible synergies between the revised EU Emissions Trading Scheme and energy taxation in such a way as to ensure that the EU meets its climate change and energy goals in the least costly way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our aim is to present the proposal in time for Parliament to render an opinion before the end of its current mandate. There are areas where effective action can only be taken by legislation at EU level. This concerns, for example, the taxation of energy use – which I have just spoken about – and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, however, other areas where Member States can take effective action themselves and where they can cooperate and benefit from experiences gained in other Member States. To this end, the Green Paper suggests the creation of a forum on market-based instruments, which would allow knowledge to be shared across sectoral boundaries and Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate about the further use of market-based instruments, which is of use to all policymakers, whether here in Strasbourg, in Brussels or in the national capitals.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="729" name="John Purvis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. − Mr President, Ms Ferreira has produced an excellent and balanced response to the Commission’s Green Paper on market-based instruments for environmental purposes, and as draftsman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ opinion under the enhanced cooperation procedure, I am very pleased that we have been able to collaborate with Ms Ferreira and contribute significantly to this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our view, the emissions trading scheme (ETS) is the most cost-efficient, demand-sensitive and objective market-based instrument available for actually reaching the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20% by the year 2020. The ETS should be the cornerstone of the market-based instruments mix, and I welcome the Commission’s proposals to improve and expand it. The scheme should have a progressively tightening cap designed to reach that 20% objective in 2020. It should also be spread as widely as possible among significant emitters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Auctioning should be the main means of allocating emissions targets, in order to avoid the disadvantages for competition of grandfathering. Auctioning is more economically efficient. It encourages new entrants, innovation and technological and operational improvements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam Commissioner, I particularly stress that we feel that energy taxation, indeed taxes and subsidies in general, should remain only a very secondary and complementary greenhouse gas reduction tool for these emissions that cannot be covered directly or indirectly by the Emissions Trading Scheme. For this reason, we find paragraph 26 of the report inconsistent with the overall message of giving priority to the Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission must urgently negotiate reciprocal agreements with other jurisdictions. Mutual and equivalent international commitments covering sectors that are vulnerable to competition would be greatly preferable to the adoption of border tax adjustments to offset trade distortions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. − Mr President, whilst a great deal is said about climate change but little is happening in terms of concrete measures, I think the EU needs to set a global example. Therefore, greater use of market-based instruments is crucial, as they are cost-effective means to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">These indirect taxes, tradable permits and subsidies, I think, will assist the European Union to achieve its emissions targets. However, while recognising that Member States need to retain flexibility over their own tax systems, any tool or aid that can support our industries and consumers to make greener choices is to be welcomed, and our policies must be such that they incentivise behavioural change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, it is imperative that market failures are corrected and that we have carbon-based pricing to reflect environmental damage as part of the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Reduced VAT on environmentally friendly products can assist the vulnerable in society, especially the elderly, who are now more than ever at risk of energy poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, any revenues raised through auctioning should be reinvested to tackle energy poverty and fund further environmental programmes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this is, as already has been said, an important report and I want to congratulate Ms Ferreira.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that our current economic model fails to integrate environmental costs into market prices. Already at the Stockholm Conference in 1972 the ‘polluter pays’ principle was established and agreed upon. But, as we know, it has not been implemented in most countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is very important. It responds to the many market failures we experience in several areas, where of course climate change is the most obvious problem today. The report suggests plenty of initiatives in many key areas. In general most of those proposals are well-drafted. However, I think more effort could have been made by us all to try to shorten the report and merge some of the individual paragraphs; very similar demands are now being put forward. I think the report would have benefited and become much clearer.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of my group and as has already been said by Mr Purvis, I have to mention that we have difficulties with a few paragraphs. One is paragraph 26. You cannot favour an emissions trading system and at the same time ask for a general CO2 tax at European level. It is inconsistent. Secondly, we have some problems with paragraph 24. While we agree with most of the contents, it is, in our opinion, too general in its language and somehow gives the impression that auctioning revenues would be or should be part of the EU budget in the future. That is not something we can support. But, apart from that, we are in general in support and once again congratulations to Ms Ferreira.</p>

      <p sl="hu">‘Let’s make the world different,’ say the people on the left who think our world should be changed. We cannot reconcile ourselves to casino capitalism – so-called development, but accompanied by the destruction of natural values. The twentieth century showed us that utopias are bound to fail without proper economic and social frameworks. The environmental basis of the ‘green tax’ and the whole tax policy can help create a better world to live in by providing a market economy and sustainable instruments. As for the increased imposition of taxes on raw materials, a single energy tax could compel everyone to reduce their dependence on energy imports, use their cars less, and invest in public transport, trams and railways. If the taxation balance was shifted from wages to consumption, a very new kind of workplace would develop and a lifestyle closer to nature and culture would have a bigger part to play, instead of consumer madness. The imposition of tax on harmful emissions and non-recyclable waste will reduce environmental pollution and the endemic diseases that accompany it, and so reduce the number of premature and unnecessary deaths. A switch-over to green taxation will be acceptable as a form of peaceful revolution. Of course, the level of taxation will not rise, as Europe is already too heavily taxed. A reduction in energy consumption would enhance the competitiveness of our goods. With green taxation, we can make the leap from the generally materialistic world of the twentieth century to a more sensible world, richer in environmentally friendly and human values. If there is one thing on which we, the European representatives of 27 countries, can all agree, it is green taxation. Let us make the world different, but through carefully considered and bold reforms.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, on her excellent work and on her close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs on this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall focus here on the two main points of the resolution, the system of exchanging CO2 quotas and green taxation. Turning first of all to emission quotas, it is disturbing to note, as has been said over and over again, that industrial CO2 emissions were up by 1% in 2007, last year, when the European Union at the spring summit had set itself the ambitious target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020. In short, the machinery is jammed and – to put it nicely and euphemistically – we have to get it started again, because it is time to get into a virtuous circle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I see two courses of action. The first is to support the European Commission, which is in favour of payment for emission quotas. The second starts from the idea that the present system relating only to CO2 is too narrow, and that other air pollutants will have to be incorporated gradually, starting no doubt with NOx and SO2.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also wonder about the favourable arrangements that still apply to the shipping sector. Unlike the situation that will soon apply in the aviation sector, it is not subject to any Community or international legislation on CO2 reduction, a double standard that we can no longer afford.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another cornerstone of the resolution is green taxation, environmental taxes, the revolution that Mr Eguy mentioned. The position of the Liberals and Democrats on that question is clear. Instruments based on the Community market should not be confined to the system of exchanging emission rights. We have to consider other systems and, as author, I am very much in favour of paragraph 27, which revives the idea of introducing a 'carbon' tax to offset a reduction in fossil fuel subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand – and I agree with Mr Purvis and Mr Wittman on this point – the ALDE Group will not support the last sentence of paragraph 26, which asks the Commission to submit a proposal on this Community CO2 tax by the end of 2008. We prefer the Union to complete its ambitious package of 'energy and climate' legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, we have to stop being hypocritical and be very aware of the cost of our ambition. If CO2 emissions are to be cut by a third, for example, every person in European must emit eight times less carbon dioxide. These blunt statistics show that, over and above the use of these market-based instruments to protect the environment, we cannot escape our own personal responsibility, and the Union will need to work very hard to stay on course, so that sustainable development is not just a fad but the model for all of us in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Ferreira for her excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Taking global responsibility to combat climate change is a crucial task that has to be achieved at various levels: not just in the world of enterprises and institutions, but among individuals as well. As European citizens, we can substantially reduce our ecological footprint and achieve major results simply by means of small measures, including our purchasing choices, that can have a global and significant impact. The Member States can encourage, or make it easier for, people to choose ecological products through market-based instruments.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as promoting research into new technologies it is important to ensure that these technologies are made available to consumers and disseminated widely enough to bring about environmental benefits for the community. It is a pity that 16 countries representing the planet’s largest economies, meeting in Paris on 16 and 18 April, did not manage to reach agreement on a joint resolution aiming to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we are hopeful that the subsequent negotiations in Kobe and Hokkaido will lead to more success in this area, especially as I believe that climate change has to be combated at a global level; otherwise, it will merely place a heavy burden on European enterprises causing them to become less competitive than their rivals from outside Europe without achieving the aim of an environmental improvement at global level.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to use market-based instruments as economic levers if we are to move towards environmentally friendly production systems that are sustainable in the long term; in that respect, I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper. The European Union has to foster the dissemination in the Member States of market-based instruments that make it possible to internalise the environmental costs of products and to promote energy efficiency and the thermal insulation of buildings. I consider that it is essential for the European Union to achieve the goal of 20% of consumption from renewable sources by 2020.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="28161" name="Margrete Auken" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Ferreira for a good report on an important subject and for enjoyable and excellent cooperation. If the EU is actually going to live up to the many fine words spoken in connection with our targets for the climate and the environment, it is crucial that we politicians take responsibility and make the difficult decisions of behalf of our electorate. One of the effective tools that we have at our disposal is to limit consumption levels that create pressure on the environment by making the polluter pay. This is an excellent principle that everyone is agreed on but that has so far not been taken seriously in cases where it really does cost the polluter. For example, motorists’ costs have never been reflected in the cost of transport. One of the first things that we should do is to internalise what are popularly referred to as ‘external costs’. This would be a significant step forwards. It is of course also possible to go further in controlling the consumption of polluting substances through even tougher financial means, and let me say here that I simply do not understand why it is not possible to combine CO2 charges with an emission trading scheme. I simply do not understand this.</p>
      <p sl="da">The use of an environmentally sound pricing policy is an effective way of using the market within environmental policy, not as a substitute for mandatory requirements and bans, but alongside them; this has also been suggested by the Commission. Concerns are often raised that the use of these market-based methods could have a skewed social impact. However, there is a need to be aware of hypocrisy. Consumption taxes usually have a fair impact, as the richest are also those who consume the most and who therefore pay the most. If there is a desire to do something about the difficulties being experienced by the poor in paying for essential consumption, there are many other methods that can be used which do not involve green taxes. For example, ordinary taxation, social and wage policies are much more appropriate if we take our responsibility for caring for the less well off seriously.</p>
      <p sl="da">One method that will not work here is based on the establishment of a type of basic consumption that is made cheaper or even free. Firstly, consumption will always be relatively high; however, the worst aspect of the model is that it does not provide any incentive to make savings. Thus, in spite of everything, progressive taxation using green taxes is better. However, the very best thing to do is to keep these market-based instruments free of other considerations if they are really to be effective in the battle to save the environment, climate and nature. It is a good thing that concern for social distortion is so great; however, in this case it is a question of saving our living space for our descendents.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We will shortly be reaching a decision on the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and Anne Ferreira on the Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes. It is an excellent report and it has my full support.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let me first make a personal comment. We are talking about market-based instruments here. Personally I am tired of the talk of market-based instruments in environmental policy. We do not need any more influence from companies or the market. We need more political control. We need more planning. We need, for example, tougher emissions requirements, we should be able to use public procurement for environmental purposes and environmental taxes and charges. It is in fact here that we have market-based instruments, because it is all about introducing taxes and charges on things which exacerbate environmental problems, internalising environmental problems in other words. These instruments are a good example of how we take political responsibility for environmental problems instead of leaving it to the market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let me give some concrete examples of particularly important aspects in this report. A minimum tax on CO2, a CO2 tax combined with a clear reduction requirement, is likely to be the most effective way of getting emissions down. My own country was the first in the world to introduce a CO2 tax. That was in the early 1990s. Without claiming that Sweden is at the forefront in all climate areas, the CO2 tax has actually been one of the main reasons behind the reduction in our CO2 emissions. It is high time that more countries did the same. In paragraph 26 of this report we call for precisely such a CO2 tax.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In general we call for more support for Member States to introduce environmental taxes. I believe today that there is an entirely unique opportunity to push for a CO2 tax and other environmental taxes. In the most recent years, awareness has increased enormously worldwide. In the report we also state that the Member States themselves determine this area. Of course this is entirely correct. It is within their field of competence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another issue is the Emission Trading Scheme. We have to admit that the first trading period 2005–2007 has been nothing other than disastrous. The scheme has not succeeded in reducing emissions and many polluters have even received overly generous allocations and made huge profits from this scheme.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this report we therefore call for auctioning of emission permits, we demand an emissions cap which is consistent with the reduction target of 30%, and restrictions and tough requirements for the use of flexible mechanisms. It is hoped that doing this will enable the trading scheme to start working. If this does not succeed, we should consider replacing the trading scheme with something else entirely, for example steep taxes on emissions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this context it is important to remember that now that aviation is to be included in emissions trading, we can no longer limit anti-aviation measures to the trading system alone. Parallel measures such as a tax on air fuel and charges on nitrogen oxide emissions, NOx, are a must, and this is precisely what we are calling for in this report. Here I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Commission a question: You previously said that you would present measures against airline nitrogen dioxide emissions, against NOx, and that this would happen this year. Can you tell us what is happening with that? Do you have a date when these measures will be in place? Considering the fact that air transport has almost doubled its emissions in recent years, many of us here would like to see concrete measures. We really cannot wait any longer!</p>
      <p sl="sv">These instruments are a good example of how we are taking political responsibility for climate change. Taxes and charges enable us to speed up the necessary reductions in emissions and hopefully solve the entire climate problem. Let us do so! This is our duty to our children and all other living beings on this beautiful planet.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my compliments to Mrs Anne Ferreira on her report on market-related instruments for environmental purposes. One of the pillars of the proposal before us is the 'polluter pays' principle. This is an important premise in that it allows for an equitable sharing of the burdens. This is also one reason why I am in favour of all external costs, and thus environmental costs too, being passed on to the consumers of manufactured and consumer goods. It makes for a realistic picture and fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In November of last year I attended the conference entitled Beyond GDP. A broad discussion was held there of ways in which indicators other than gross domestic product alone might be used to measure social wellbeing, because in practice social and environmental factors play a part here, as well as economic factors. You may be doing very nicely financially, but if you live in a densely populated city with too much air pollution, your quality of life is not all that wonderful. I am glad that Mrs Ferreira makes this point in her report too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, I would like to express my support for two specific paragraphs in her report, paragraphs 58 and 59, on internalising environmental factors in the pricing of water and, secondly, a legislative framework to reduce the level of waste generated in the medium term.</p>

    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="28299" name="Bogusław Sonik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the threat to the world’s environmental balance requires us to take steps that will result in changes to our models of growth and a new lifestyle in our societies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Business activity has ecological costs that are often not taken into consideration in financial accounting. Despite the fact that the polluter pays principle, one of the pillars of the European Union’s environmental policy, is in force throughout the Community, its application in certain countries leaves much to be desired.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union is introducing a series of items of legislation and rules to improve the state of the environment, and it is vital to introduce new market instruments. Economic taxes in the European Union could play a very significant role in achieving environmental protection objectives within the EU. So far, the only system in place is the emissions trading system for carbon dioxide. This would appear to be insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Other market instruments should be considered. It is very important that income from ecological taxes should be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment and on human health. It would seem that a gradual harmonisation of environmental taxes throughout the EU is essential. Ecological taxation in Member States is very varied. Leaving solutions for these issues in the hands of Member States runs the risk of distortions in competitiveness between companies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When introducing new market instruments a number of basic guidelines have to be followed: the public have to accept them, the taxes cannot be seen as yet another obligation imposed by the European Union and also the taxes have to be introduced gradually.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Some EU Member States already have their own market instruments, for example, energy saving certificates or green energy certificates. However, all Member States should give strong support to low-carbon technologies, energy saving and renewable technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to point out that the European Union is a leader in the area of environmental protection and I believe it has a responsibility to set an example to the rest of the world.</p>

    <intervention id="4-022" speaker_id="23717" name="Genowefa Grabowska" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent approach to the issue of environmental protection. I would also remind you that we have known since the UN report entitled ‘Our Common Future’, which was prepared by Margot Wallström, that it is our responsibility to future generations, to our children and grandchildren, to leave the natural environment in the best possible condition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The involvement of the European Union in this area is already very good, but the European Parliament is also keeping its finger on the pulse. We have a special temporary Committee on Climate Change, we have good legislation, and we enact regulations, directives and decisions. Now the time has come to strengthen other mechanisms, especially financial incentives and taxes, and also to step up information campaigns and preventive measures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For these actions to be effective, there has to be a Community approach. Member States have to overcome their reluctance and their resistance to tax harmonisation, at least as far as the environment is concerned. Even though they are used for sensible purposes, ecological taxes are not at all popular at present. Just like all taxes, they are disliked. For this reason we have to make all possible efforts at European and national levels to make ecological payments and taxes socially acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What we need are activities that inspire a high level of ecological awareness. We need incentives that will ensure that good practices are used widely and will promote pro-ecological social behaviour. After all, no one complains when, in the European Parliament shop, we are asked to pay five cents for a plastic bag. This is of fundamental importance – not the financial dimension of this action, but the moment of reflection that accompanies it, when the customer thinks whether to take the plastic bag, or to leave it and reduce the amount of rubbish on the planet. This is a good way to make people think. People will accept financial charges, taxes and other environmental levies, but only when they believe they are sensible and can see a positive outcome.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome market-based instruments as a means of implementing policies, including environmental policy. I would, however, make the point that no policy instrument is effective simply because it carries the label ‘market-based’.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the instruments that we use to achieve policy objectives must meet certain criteria. For example, is the instrument appropriate to the given objective? If we confuse different objectives we will not achieve any of them properly. If part of the thinking behind an environmental measure is that it should be a means of making money, we are already on uncertain ground because the measure is liable to be distorted for a variety of reasons. Does a given instrument actually help to achieve an objective? That question needs to be closely – and regularly – examined. Is a given instrument compatible with others that already exist? What about efficiency – the relationship between cost and benefit?</p>
      <p sl="de">Reading this report, I am doubtful in some cases whether the criteria I refer to have been met. Emissions trading systems work very well in theory but the reality is somewhat different. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is in a state of chaos. Fortunes have been wiped out and the actual aim of the scheme has not been achieved. Fair enough, you may say, this is the experimental phase and we have not yet got it right; but we certainly cannot afford much more of this expensive experimentation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The policy on taxation of energy use also illustrates my point. Taxation really has no place in an EU Green Paper about market-based instruments. The mere fact that an instrument influences sections of the market does not make it market-based. I have no objection in principle to tax measures being used to achieve environmental objectives but I will support their introduction only if they meet the criteria I have mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">My case is that we should set out the objectives to be achieved; the choice of means to achieve them should then be left to those involved in the market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the market-based instruments for environmental policy purposes, as described by the rapporteur, come down in large part to taxes and charges. As she rightly points out in paragraph 28 it could happen that they do not fulfil the stated objectives but, instead, become just a means to increase tax revenue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The matters that have been discussed in some detail are aimed just at the future. The question is: according to the polluter pays principle, who is to clean the soil, water and air that have been polluted by past industrial waste or by outdated pesticides, asbestos, phosphorus pentachloride and other compounds?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that the green bonds referred to in paragraph 67 would be very good for this purpose. Companies involved in this process could be allocated tasks that had not otherwise been dealt with and would carry them out with the help of the financial markets. The introduction of such bonds, which could be called green bonds, would make it possible to resolve many problems associated with the introduction of market-based instruments into the area of environmental protection. It is an excellent idea and I congratulate Mrs Ferreira.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome Ms Ferreira’s excellent work and cooperation, thanks to which we have before us a report that gives a comprehensive and honest appraisal of the potential and limitations of market-based instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Market instruments clearly have a role to play. Making economic logic align with environmental and social reality by applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be a powerful way of steering patterns of production and consumption towards sustainability. For example, if the true environmental and social costs of freight transport were internalised within prices paid along the supply chain, we might finally see an end to the madness that sees more or less identical products being pointlessly traded back and forth between distant countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Applying such principles at the level of individuals via a system of personal carbon trading could be an extremely effective way of influencing consumer behaviour. But, as Ms Ferreira’s report rightly makes clear, market instruments must not be seen as a replacement for other forms of environmental standards and regulation. Their usefulness also depends crucially on the way in which they are designed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The emissions trading system is a case in point. I would like to warn colleagues that, if we listen to a lot of what the industry is telling us, we will end up with a scheme that is no more than trading backwards and forwards for the sake of trading, as we have seen with the first two phases, completely losing sight of any environmental objectives. To be effective, the scheme has to have a tough cap deriving from the 30% emissions reduction target, restrictions on the entry of outside credits and full auctioning of allowances from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to mention one other welcome thread running through the report – the recognition that traditional economic growth as measured by GDP is no longer an adequate or accurate measure of true well-being. A conference was held on this topic in Parliament earlier this year and I look forward to the Commission’s report in the autumn.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, environmental issues have justifiably become one of the biggest political issues of our time and they have also, justifiably, become one of the most important areas for EU cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, cross-border environmental pollution in Europe cannot be tackled at national level, and this gives the EU a clear role here. Secondly, the EU is the world’s largest economy, with enormous production and foreign trade, and the Member States are united in taking responsibility for the environmental consequences of this fact. This combination of size and agreement on fundamental environmental targets gives the EU the opportunity to exercise a global influence which can be of major importance.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the report does not inspire trust. It makes no distinction between consumption of finite resources and impact on climate. The rapporteur also shamelessly uses the climate question as an argument for supranationalism, bureaucracy and protectionism, making an all-out call for joint taxation, a review of the notion of free competition and tariff increases. There is no realisation that countries must seek solutions in competition with each other. Then to cap it all, there is the usual officious statement that we must adopt a new lifestyle in our western societies.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Appalling! Our job is to ensure that the environmental costs of consumption are reflected in the prices consumers pay. Free citizens choose their lifestyles for themselves.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, yesterday, in this Parliament, I was questioned by a 16-year-old high-school student, who asked me, 'Is Europe prepared to make great sacrifices to save the planet?'. This young student was very worried about climate change and was asking us how far we could go. It was an expression of the distress felt by idealistic young people who expect a lot of us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Well, we have market-based instruments that have been put in place: the Community system for the exchange of greenhouse gas emission quotas, and the 'Eurovignette' directive in the transport sector. These instruments have certain advantages because they set a value on environmental costs and help towards the achievement of environmental targets, at a lower cost, and they encourage businesses to make a longer-term commitment, which ultimately sustains employment. These instruments can help to reduce the damaging effects that environmental taxes could have on competitiveness in some sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The promotion of sustainable development and the efforts to combat climate change should not be just a deterrent, through taxes and charges, but also an incentive, by facilitating a quicker transition to virtuous and eco-friendly behaviour. Everyone has to make the effort; that is why environmental costs need to be internalised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It must also be stressed that environmental taxes should not be regarded as a way of increasing tax revenue, but as a means of preventing all harmful pollution and damage to the environment, at a reasonable cost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in future debates on the 'energy-climate' package in the European Parliament, we shall have to give serious consideration to putting in place a border adjustment instrument, which will in particular help avoid any carbon leaks. We need to fulfil the obligation to reduce CO2 emissions, whilst preserving economic competitiveness. In that connection, I emphasise the importance of the 'carbon' tax. That is often a taboo subject, but I still think it is worthwhile and should be considered.</p>

      <p sl="bg">We ought to come up with a combination of solutions, a general model and principles. The report makes this clear in an excellent way. To protect the environment is cheaper than to rehabilitate it, but the failure to use fair market tools means to provide hidden subsidies to polluters. The green toolbox needs flexibility if we are to have certainty and make sure we do not default on other indicators and increase the burden for citizens. Trade instruments need to be combined with promoting investment in new technology, with offsetting instruments for overcoming deficits.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Individual countries do matter. Bulgaria, for example, will be facing problems in the future. The closing down of certain parts of the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy lead to an increase in generation at thermal power plants, electricity prices went up. This increases emissions, yet the low GHG allowances work like penalties and consumers are paying the increased price. Unless carbon dioxide allowance are reallocated and in the absence of sufficient compensation to off-set the decommissioned power units, the application of the other trade instruments will bring about more problems. Environmental economics has its social dimensions and we should not wait until 2010 or 2013 before we act.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to stress that tackling climate change requires more extensive actions than those focusing on transport and energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Avoiding deforestation should also be at the core of the EU climate change mitigation strategy, as a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions fairly quickly. Avoiding deforestation can be achieved only by a mix of regulatory approach and market-based instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Civil society has repeatedly exposed the way the EU actively contributes to global deforestation by allowing illegal timber to freely enter its market. It is vital that the EU introduces legislation to ensure that only timber and timber products from legal sources are placed on the EU market. This regulatory approach should be complemented by a set of market-based instruments specifically designed for forestry, such as charges for premature harvesting of forests or incentives for sustainable forest management. However, in order to use market-based instruments more widely in forestry, we need to clarify which instruments work best, to what extent they can be used and how they can be correlated with regulatory law.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call on the Commission to present an analysis of the most appropriate market-based instruments for the forestry sector, and to outline the suitable context for these instruments to be used and combined with other policy tools.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to draw attention to just two matters in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, the way that the burden associated with counteracting climate change has been allocated within the European Union framework is highly unfair. For example, carbon dioxide emission limits were allocated to individual Member States without taking into account the backwardness in their development, which, in Poland among other countries, has resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of electricity and, as a result, a visible jump in the costs of production and also living costs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the implementation of the climate package, according to the estimates of the European Commission itself, will come to about EUR 50 billion per annum. In a situation where the majority of the fastest growing nations of the world, such as China, India and Brazil, as well as economic powerhouses such as the United States, are not too bothered about climate change, it could well happen that the European economy will stop being competitive in world markets, which means it will be necessary to introduce instruments to protect European output, burdened as it is by such high additional costs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">They should know the market instruments used for purposes related to environmental policies and other related policies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The trade in emission certificates, the Directive on Fuel Quality, the EURO standards for vehicles, the Directive on Purchases of Clean and Energy-efficient Road Vehicles, the EURO 6 standard for vehicles are only some of the Commission’s initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In October, the Commission will come up with a proposal to review the Commission on Eurovignette, based on internalizing external costs, including environmentally-related costs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a Rapporteur for the opinion of the TRAN Committee for the draft Directive regarding clean and energy-efficient road vehicles, I consider it important to calculate the costs of a vehicle for its entire useful life, taking into consideration not only the initial purchase price, but also the price of the fuel used, carbon dioxide emissions, etc.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I offer many congratulations to Ms Ferreira for an excellently balanced report. Our environment is suffering under the insults inflicted as a result of an ever-increasing world population and man’s uncontrolled appetite for materialistic consumption. The climate is changing, biodiversity is suffering and natural resources are diminishing. The rapporteur, having fully understood the task at hand, is rightly supporting the view that the main market instruments needed to remedy the situation are financial incentives and taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consequently, I fully support the idea of an EU environmental taxation system, which will inevitably have to be uniform amongst the Member States. At the same time, an effectively revised carbon emissions trading scheme will, I am sure, help to improve matters significantly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, environmental protection covers many areas and its effectiveness depends on synchronisation and judicious application of the tools that are available, and this includes economic instruments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The instruments associated with the Green Paper present a series of measures without offering systemic solutions. One example of this is support for savings in fuel used for communal transport and other purposes, which are legitimate. However, the sudden increase in the price of environmentally-friendly electricity rings some alarm bells, as does the fact that in large measure it is created using hydrocarbons. The proposed carbon dioxide emission charges punish the consequences but do not address the cause. The promotion of clean sources of energy, such as water, wind, solar power and atomic energy, together with stability in their prices, would have a significant impact for society, the economy and environmental protection and should be an area where systemic measures are undertaken. Mrs Ferreira’s report raises this issue.</p>

      <p sl="cs">As we heard in many previous speeches, carbon dioxide is an important and perhaps a key player in so-called ecological price determination, and is presented as the cause of climate change. I want to draw your attention to the fact that, according to scientific research, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases not before the earth heats up but only after it heats up. This warming process correlates with the sun’s activity so that warming is an effect rather than a cause. As a result, the main emitters of carbon dioxide after warming are the oceans. Of course, I am not against a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity but I think that we have to accept our responsibility for pollution that has health-related and other consequences, rather than responsibility for climate change.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, this a good report. I do not want to repeat the points that have been raised already, but I would like just to draw attention to a few particular issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, human beings are not the most important part of the ‘environment’ and humans do not own the water, the soil and the earth. Humans only use them, we are just tenants. We must keep this fact in mind. Issues that affect the environment know no borders – air, water and the soil are not subject to frontiers – so our activities also have to go across frontiers. This applies at European Union level, but it also applies throughout the whole world. Otherwise our activities will not achieve their objective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to emphasise one other matter. Apart from these fiscal issues and economic pressures, it is very important to raise people’s awareness, starting from children. Otherwise we will not have energy-saving technical devices, houses, cars and vehicles.

      <p sl="pl">In today’s debate, we have discussed how we have to have an ecological mind-set. I am convinced that there is considerable ecological awareness in the European Union and in individual Member States. People want to live ecologically, they want to have an ecological lifestyle and they are very ecologically aware.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, let us not forget that many European Union countries, such as Bulgaria and Poland, lived for many decades under a different system. Our economies were based on another method of obtaining energy. The regulations on the system of environmental taxes could therefore reduce the competitiveness of these economies and, as a result, reduce environmental awareness.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, over-emphasis on taxation – with the frequent calling on the Commission to come forward with legislation for the same throughout this report, for example, paragraph 26, which ‘calls on the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal for a Community minimum tax on CO2 before the end of 2008’ – makes the report as a whole unacceptable to me, despite the excellent work and the many recommendations I can support.

      <p sl="fr">Thank you, Commissioner, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your very thorough and interesting contributions. We appreciate that the taxation debate is not closed and I should like just to mention three points at this stage in the discussions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the proportion accounted for by energy taxes. On average they represent 76% of environmental taxation, compared with 21% for transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, domestic consumers, who have to pay by far the largest proportion of environmental taxes, when other sectors of the economy are the biggest consumers of energy, water and transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, the proportion of GDP of Member States represented by environmental taxes has declined over the past five years. That gives us something else to think about in our future deliberations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I certainly regret what the EPP is asking for on paragraph 26, in which we were proposing a minimum Community tax on CO2. It seems to me that we need to continue along that path if we want to prevent dumping in the European Union. The idea is not to take over tax powers from the Member States, it is to have minimum tax harmonisation. That is necessary and it has been underlined.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from the fact that Member States are asking for further progress towards tax coordination, I should also like to draw attention to another point in the report. The reduction in taxes on employment cannot be linked only to the reduction in environmental taxes, as the Commission is proposing. In my view, it should be part of a more general reform, with principles of solidarity and social justice. I am well aware that that is not yet a competence of the States, but let us think about it here and give the Member States some information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The final point that I think is important is the domestic dimension. The measures we take here should not have an adverse effect on households that are already on low incomes and make the position of other households more insecure.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In order to achieve their environmental aims the Member States nowadays give preference almost exclusively to direct regulation, even though there are many other regulatory instruments available. We feel more focus should be given to market-based environmental protection incentives. We believe that the concepts of the market, competition and protection of the environment are not mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The significance of market incentives is that the aim of environmental quality can be achieved more cheaply and more effectively with them, and other social objectives can be achieved at the same time. Unfortunately, the European Union has not done much to encourage market-based incentives, though the emissions trading scheme could be given as an exception. It is therefore comforting that the Green Paper contains a survey of hidden opportunities for these topical incentives. We might add, however, that the survey should have gone a lot further.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A wider use of market-based regulation should go hand in hand with a reduction in ineffective direct regulation. Since economic incentives are income-generating, we have to examine just how these instruments, primarily imposed on labour, can generate taxes. This subject warrants intensive debate. We are also convinced that the EU’s ambitious environment policy objectives cannot be fulfilled without going further in the field of market incentives.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Alexander Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (2006/2248(INI)) (A6-0032/2008).</p>

    <intervention id="4-045" speaker_id="4292" name="Alexander Radwan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, the subject matter of the report before us would seem, at first glance, to be highly technical. It concerns so-called accounting standards in the European Union and worldwide, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. It may very well be the type of subject that is discussed now in the European Parliament and then takes several years to begin to affect the economy and ordinary people. At that stage the cry will go up that nobody knows where these standards come from or who is responsible for them. Nor will anyone know why they have to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="de">The objective is to achieve a single set of global accounting standards, particularly for public limited companies. We support that objective. The argument we hear advanced for it is that we need ‘high quality standards’, and this House considers itself the only forum empowered to set those high quality standards. However, in these times of turbulence on the financial markets, it is astonishing to hear the same people who previously argued for the principle of ‘fair value’ now questioning that principle and asking, too, whether a ‘market to market’ approach still makes sense if we no longer have a market. The very people who let the genie out of the bottle are the ones now asking whether we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">The only people responsible for these standards are the people sitting in the offices of this private organisation in London, who are undoubtedly influenced in making their standards by the desire to keep themselves in a job. My report, on which we are to vote today, therefore concerns not just the impact on small and medium-sized companies, but also the fundamental question of who makes rules for whom, and who supervises the application of the rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first issue to address is that of governance: how transparent is this organisation? In other words, how transparent is its funding? There are certainly hidden interests here. The members of this committee, who are demanding transparency and always try to portray the market as transparent, should make at least a modicum of effort to comply themselves with the transparency requirements they lay down for the market! My impression so far is that this organisation fights with every means at its disposal to avoid transparency in any form.</p>
      <p sl="de">Who takes the decisions about financing and the choice of personnel for specific posts? Why are individuals appointed? Is it about regional balance? Is it about inter-sector balance? The current project concerns IFRS for small and medium-sized companies, so it is fair to ask who represents small and medium-sized companies. Who knows about small and medium-sized companies? And another thing: why are IFRS for small and medium-sized companies actually on the agenda right now? Who sets the agenda?</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner McCreevy and Sir David Tweedie have also been asked many times, over a number of years, why we are actually doing this. Several years down the line we now know why we are discussing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies in Europe: it is because of requests from South Africa and Brazil. What a marvellous answer! We know quite well that the focus of all this is not South Africa or Brazil, but rather the European market, where there will be a lot of money to be made if SMEs are required to introduce something like this. So these are the issues at stake in the matter of governance – and some initial, positive steps have been taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">But all the bodies that are to be set up in the future will be assessed according to whether the people who belong to this supervisory organisation and have to answer questions about it at political level – and they could include a Member of the Commission – will also have the power to shape new developments. It is not enough for them simply to be notified of proposals.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of our aims is convergence. We must take care, however, that the interpretation of convergence does not slip from Europe’s grasp, to be replaced by the SEC’s interpretation. In Europe today we are sufficiently familiar with the way the US stock exchange is supervised. We should not be so naïve as to leave the business of supervision to the Americans. What we want is therefore what we have already called for: IFRS as Europe understands them and not as this board dictates.</p>
      <p sl="de">Small and medium-sized companies are the ones affected here, and I have to say, without mincing my words, that the ideas on the table today are too complicated and too difficult. I would also warn against taking the voluntary approach. I am wearing my Bavarian national costume today and a good old Bavarian term comes to mind here: it is ‘hinterfotzig’ and it means something like ‘through the back door’. We know very well – despite all the denials and the acquiescence – that IFRS for small and medium-sized companies will be introduced to the European market through the back door, via a small number of Member States. We will then hear the same voices calling for a single set of standards, and they will proceed to foist their standards on the market – standards which are too complex, which nobody understands and nobody wants – purely because there is a market opportunity. What we have here is a case of a minority trying to impose its will on a majority at global level, and it is unacceptable!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, for the considerable work that has gone into this comprehensive report.</p>
      <p sl="en">It raises important issues for the future development of European and indeed global capital markets. In this brief intervention I cannot address all the issues raised in the report. Let me therefore focus on three points. One, governance issues; secondly the EU’s input to the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB; and thirdly the project to develop an accounting standard for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">On IASB governance, your report rightly highlights the fact that our shared objective is to develop high-quality global accounting standards. The EU’s decision to require listed companies to use international accounting standards was a bold and visionary step towards this objective. A single set of globally accepted accounting standards would provide significant benefits for our companies, our capital markets and our economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must continuously strive to ensure that international accounting standards remain relevant in the face of changing economic circumstances and that they represent the interests of all stakeholders in a balanced manner. To ensure that these conditions can continue to be met, progress should be made as a matter of priority in three areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the accountability of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF), needs to be enhanced, in particular towards public authorities. The latter should play an active role in the selection and appointment of trustees. In this respect, the proposal that I, together with my counterparts in the US SEC, the Japanese FSA and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, made last November goes in the direction advocated by your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need to look at how the IASB’s agenda-setting process can be improved. In particular, the process through which priorities are set needs to be made more open and more transparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the IASB’s due process should be enhanced, mainly by ensuring that standards are subject to a full impact assessment before they are adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report makes constructive suggestions about these and related points. The forthcoming review of the IASCF’s constitution provides the opportunity to implement the necessary reforms. The committee will pursue them in consultation with this House, the Member States and our international partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, turning to the EU’s input to the IASB. Your report argues that the EU needs to strengthen its capacity to make its views on accounting matters heard at the international level. I agree. In particular we should seek means to ensure that the views of European stakeholders, especially proactive input to the IASB’s agenda-setting process, can be put to the IASB in a more timely and coherent manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see this as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary process. We should build on the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and I am ready to pursue this as a matter of urgency, including the possibility of using funding from the Community budget to support such a structure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must, however, sound a clear and unambiguous warning. This structure will in no circumstances become an embryonic European standard-setter, nor can there be any question of developing European interpretations of international accounting standards. Europe must and will remain part of the movement towards a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. Anything else would damage the international competitiveness of our companies and our capital market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning now to the IASB’s project to develop an accounting standard for SMEs, let me begin by stating that the Commission currently has no legal basis to endorse this standard. Moreover, we have never made any commitment to take over whatever standard the IASB produces. We would only do so if we were genuinely convinced that the IASB produces a standard that meets the interests of European users.</p>
      <p sl="en">The IASB has not yet finalised its project. However, at this stage the Commission’s views are clear. The current exposure draft published by the IASB remains too complex to provide a satisfactory accounting framework for European SMEs, especially for smaller companies. Our focus remains the simplification of the regulatory environment for SMEs, including in the accounting area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the IAS system makes sense for big listed companies that operate worldwide. That is why, during Parliament’s last term, we decided, on the Legal Affairs Committee’s proposal, to adopt the IAS Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ultimate aim – as Alexander Radwan has said – was indeed to achieve convergence, at least with the USA and if possible worldwide. The system makes no sense in the case of small and medium-sized companies because, as a rule, they have no need of international financial markets, no need of Wall Street and the rest. For that reason alone, the necessity of developing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies is highly questionable.</p>
      <p sl="de">On top of that – and I think Commissioner McCreevy was entirely right here – the current proposal is for nothing more than a slimmed-down version of what are, by any measure, extremely complicated international standards, entirely unsuited to the structure of small and medium-sized companies in Europe. They are particularly ill-suited to family companies, which have been run by their owners for several generations; which have already written off property belonging to them; and in which the application of fair-value rules would simply encourage greed and, in the end, could very well jeopardise the companies’ chances of survival.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we must be realistic. Ultimately, the question of accounting standards for SMEs in Europe will not be exempt from some form of pressure for harmonisation. Our demand is for comparability, at least within the Single Market. So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London, with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too – but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term, rather than short-term valuation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one further point to make about the IAS bodies. There is a real problem here, as Alexander Radwan has outlined. There may be a certain geographical balance but there is no balance in terms of economic weight. Europe is by far the largest bloc, the largest region in which the IAS rules apply. That is why we must have a commensurate say, and we simply cannot be compared with somewhere like Australia. Australia carries the same weight as a middle-sized EU country or, indeed, a big region like North Rhine-Westphalia. The balance needs to be improved in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all my compliments to Mr Radwan on getting this thorough report completed. It was under discussion up to the very last minute. In its final form it is a report that is clear, but sometimes critical too. The rapporteur is convinced that the IASB's democratic accountability has to be improved and I am glad to see the IASB taking this criticism on board.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Chairman of the Trustees, Mr Gerrit Zalm, indicated recently in the European Parliament that he was open to suggestions and ready to put forward proposals on adapting the structure. The IASB is working on IFRS standards for small and medium enterprises. I agree with the rapporteur that IFRS are too complex and too expensive for SMEs. I also believe that encouraging the voluntary use of IFRS by SMEs would carry the risk of them being introduced into Europe by the back door. In my view there has to be differentiation according to company size. It is a good thing to have big multinationals, banks and insurance companies which operate worldwide producing their annual accounts to a single standard. But small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe should have their own standard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The IASB has achieved much in respect of internationally listed companies and accounting standards for them. If SMEs are now saying that cost and effort can be just as well managed using more than one standard, we cannot have a single standard being imposed from the top down. It is also very important that the interests of investors and of transparency should be considered too. Policy is there to facilitate, to ensure that there is sound, transparent and cost-effective information on business performance. I think the proven benefits of IFRS can also benefit European equity markets, certainly if the Americans exchange their US GAAP system for IFRS. Comparability here can be very beneficial to international investors and stakeholders. The idea behind IFRS thus deserves to be supported by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Thank you, Commissioner, for managing to come to Strasbourg. Thank you also to the rapporteur, in your Bavarian costume. I think we worked very well together, and the way in which it was possible for various people’s amendments to be incorporated in your report is proof of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I should like to make three points about accounting standards. It seems to me that, in terms of the governance and operation of the body responsible for setting these accounting standards, we are in an unusual situation. There are many forms of standardisation. Not all of them have such a strong impact on financial stability, or on the issues, in terms of power and governance, as accounting standards have. What is happening today is an important event, a passage to adulthood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When these accounting standards were formulated, perhaps by auditors who worked amongst themselves, they basically prepared the ground very well. Nowadays these accounting standards are international. They are used and applied by everyone and so the question of governance is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How does the body responsible for setting these accounting standards fit in with international governance, in relation to democratic bodies, bodies that legitimately represent State power, and the European Union in particular?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point we need to look at in regard to governance is of course the balance between those bodies. What is the geographical balance, what is the balance in the representation not just of those who draw up the standards, but also of those who will have to use them?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is financing. How are these bodies to be financed? Might the idea of a levy on businesses, which would be coordinated by regulatory bodies, be worthwhile? Could they be financed by government, by the European Community? We hope that the Commissioner will be making some strong proposals on that point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth question in regard to those bodies is the programme. Is it right for them to develop the concept of fair value when we know the effects that can have on financial stability? Is it right for this body to develop an SME programme that Europe does not need? Is it right that, on this issue of standards for SMEs – just because, as our rapporteur has said, South Africa or Australia might need them – the Commissioner did not make sure that Europe had a say in those bodies. It is absolutely essential, as a first step, that Europe should make sure it is there to represent the strength of all the Member States and the voice of Europeans, in the IASB, the IASCF and IFRIC. Commissioner, that is your responsibility. We are expecting strong proposals from you on that point.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, IFRSs are being adapted by more and more countries, so their value and importance is growing. This brings with it a need to strengthen accountability and transparency of the IASB, which may not have been so obvious at its inception. I welcome moves in that direction, but I regret that some parts of this report present criticism in a negative way, rather than acknowledging changes that are under way and pointing the way forward. So several of my amendments aim to be more forward-looking, highlighting the advantages and benefits, alongside the need for further adaptation, both to the standards themselves and the IASB that oversees them. However, unnecessary politicisation of technical issues must be avoided. IFRSs are an important tool for advancing comparability across borders and reducing burdensome requirements for companies reporting under different regimes, but it would be useful if presentation of financial statements lent itself more easily to other comparison purposes. However, it may well be the case that tools such as XBRL tagging can develop that. I have to thank Ms van den Burg for organising an interesting presentation on that subject last week.</p>
      <p sl="de">The SME proposals cause concern in several quarters. To me they look more like a tool for medium entities, perhaps on their way to full public reporting, so they may merit their own separate consideration in that light or on a voluntary basis. But – as you have said, Commissioner – as yet they are far too complex for the majority of ordinary SMEs.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-051" speaker_id="28112" name="Gay Mitchell" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I commend my colleague Mr Radwan for a very well written report. I hope the Bavarian national dress he is wearing here this morning is not indicative of a change in political direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The adoption of the IFRSs in January 2005 has brought great benefits to the European Union by making accountancy requirements simpler across borders and financial statements easier to compare across countries, competitors and industries, enhancing the work of regulatory oversight, banking and capital markets. International financial reporting standards are now being used or are being adopted in more than a hundred countries, including Australia, South Africa and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the calls for increased transparency, effectiveness and accountability over the IASB. The report points to the fact that 17 months had passed before the IASB appointed a new chairperson. This cannot be acceptable. The IASB is a private, self-regulatory body which has been given the role of rule-maker and it is only right that we demand increased accountability and oversight because of that. We should also be careful about calling for the establishment of extra EU structures to deal with the interpretation and application of IFRS standards. Why is it needed? What will it do?</p>
      <p sl="en">On the subject of EU-US convergence, there has been great progress made in this area and in the EU-US accounting road map. Last year, the US President, the President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the European Commission signed a joint EU-US statement which undertook to promote and to seek to ensure conditions for the US generally accepted accounting principles and the IFRSs to be recognised in both jurisdictions. This is very welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the application of the IFRSs to SMEs, SMEs are small and smaller. I feel it might be better to make it optional so as to ensure flexibility, rather than prevent its application outright.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I must echo the compliments paid to Mr Radwan, not least because his report has enabled us to have a very interesting debate on the conflicts between legislation and self-regulation, especially at world level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I appreciate that our aspirations place us in a quandary. On the one hand we want these international standards, applicable worldwide, but on the other hand we insist on our authority as co-legislator to judge the substance of those standards and to discharge our duty as co-legislator responsibly. I think the European Parliament has shown latterly that it does that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To my mind the key lies in timely consultation, in a balanced consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, including third-party interests of employees, local authorities, suppliers and so on (because adequate financial reporting benefits more than just money providers alone), and a sound assessment of the consequences. The Commission has a weighty responsibility here. And in the immediate future these things must be done on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises. We can make this a really worthwhile project for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, I have two comments which are also relevant to another report which we shall be voting on in our next part-session, Mr Lehne's report on a simplified business environment for companies. Here too I have taken the line that rules are not just for companies, money providers and the accountants who earn their living from them, but also for employees and other groups. So we must not meddle with the quality of the rules. I have advocated that the rules should in any event be applied to delisted companies and off-balance activities. I hope you will agree that there is also work for the IASB to do in that area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will end by repeating my heartfelt endorsement of the XBRL standard. As you are aware, the US SEC is about to take a decision making this mandatory. I urge you to think about how Europe should respond to this, and encourage you to draw up a roadmap for Europe accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are issues with the transparency and governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), but it has accepted this criticism and acknowledged the need to change. Steps have been taken and more are planned: publication of feedback statements, explaining the reasoning behind its decisions, pushing cost-benefit analyses and enlargement and more active involvement of the board of trustees. It bent over backwards to communicate with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Radwan’s report is much improved from earlier versions and I believe the positive amendments from the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups will further improve the text today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur because, although we have had our differences, he was willing to compromise in certain areas on this governance aspect. Unfortunately, I am unable to agree with him on the issue of International Financial Reporting Standards for SMEs. The IASB was asked to draw up a simplified version for SMEs. Mr Radwan’s report declines to acknowledge that this could also be useful in the European Union. In fact, with the proposal still only at the drafting stage, the report proclaims that it will definitely not benefit EU companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet we have been told repeatedly that it will be optional and is designed for those growing SMEs which aim to become public listed companies. Small enterprises with no aspirations beyond their local markets need not take it up. An opinion survey last September found that a clear majority of European SMEs, including German SMEs, considered the benefits outweighed any disadvantages and would improve financial reporting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The efforts of the IASB to develop global accounting standards of a high quality are a major and welcome contribution to the European and world economies and, frankly, I think we should be applauding them.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the requirement since 2005 for publicly traded companies to use the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) for their consolidated financial statements has been a wide-ranging and hugely influential political initiative.</p>
      <p sl="es">About 100 countries are using the standards and their globalisation has provided comparability and transparency, thereby increasing the confidence of operators, creating a more level playing field and strengthening market discipline.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposal contains two great challenges relating to governance. On the one hand, the private entity, which has been setting worldwide voluntary standards since 1973 on a corporate and professional basis, now finds itself in a position of huge responsibility entailing a change in its nature, procedures and composition in order that it can become a transparent, controllable institution, with a legitimacy reflecting its new role.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is necessary to recognise and coordinate the activities of all the public and private interests concerned and at the same time to secure the organisation’s financing and independence in the setting of standards. Furthermore, the organisation must be integrated into international governance.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also necessary to strengthen European accounting governance by adopting a more proactive and integrated approach to the preparation, approval, implementation and assessment of standards. It is vital to improve the conceptual framework of standards, and to bear in mind that they are neither neutral nor academic and can produce both winners and losers. Likewise it is important to assess their effects and ensure their compatibility with European strategy, to learn from financial upheavals and to regulate the accounting standards of administrative concessions in a balanced way.</p>
      <p sl="es">The financial accounting arrangements for SMEs will need to be simple and be linked to their exploitation of the internal and global market. These matters are covered by Mr Radwan’s report, which has achieved broad consensus and comes at a very opportune moment in terms of the upcoming review at the end of 2009, envisaging the creation of a supervisory body and altering the composition of the Standards Advisory Council before next year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Radwan, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report and this debate because I think we are probing some really sensitive issues, and we are doing so on a genuinely cross-party basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Several points emerge very clearly from what has been said. Firstly, we need a single set of standards for public limited companies, but we do not want to lump all companies together. Secondly, while we are not rejecting specific rules tailored to SMEs, the framework for those rules must be established by us, by the European Union. Thirdly, the measures currently proposed are too complex and too expensive, they are of no use to SMEs and for those reasons we must reject them. Fourthly, we are still awaiting satisfactory answers to the questions of who makes what rules for whom, and who supervises the process. There is no democratic legitimacy; there is no differentiation of approach; no account has been taken of the justifiable wishes of SMEs; and the system of democratic supervision is inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, in taking a stance on this issue or trying to answer these questions, it is often forgotten that two-thirds of the workforce are employed in the private sector in family-owned companies, and the majority of those family-owned companies are SMEs that do not seek finance from the capital markets. This is a point we need to remember when we are confronted with proposals that would treat all companies alike.</p>

      <p sl="en">As we also draw attention to the need for EU law changes in paragraph 41, I rise to remind the Commissioner that this Parliament has voted that any changes to the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives should include a requirement for social and environmental reporting by companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I draw to his attention such requirements in South Africa, in France’s law on new economic regulations, as well as the recommendations of the Prince of Wales’s Accounting for Sustainability project from my own country, the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the mean time, and in addition, I would like to ask the Commissioner, following the 2001 Commission recommendation on environmental issues in our new accounts, whether the Commission could issue a similar recommendation on social issues in accounts. I would also like to ask the Commissioner to press the International Accounting Standards Board to include social and environmental aspects in its planned publication of a management commentary. The Commission may or may not want to call this corporate social responsibility, but perhaps today we can all agree to call it accounting for responsible companies.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the recent financial crises have shown the importance of high-quality accounting standards for the proper functioning of the markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">This being the case, it seems to me that another lesson of the crisis is that there is a certain asymmetry between the stated importance of accounting standards and the nature and operation of the private entities responsible for setting, producing and interpreting those standards.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Radwan’s report is therefore correct to point out that the first matter to be dealt with is that of governance. In my view he has put forward intelligent and realistic proposals about the need for the institutions representing the Union to be more proactive in this process of setting standards which are to be incorporated into the Community legal order, also concerning the internal operating rules of those private entities. Greater transparency, safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and broader geographical representation are some of the proposals which Mr Radwan has put forward.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second aspect dealt with in the report is the matter of small and medium-sized undertakings. We have emphasised here in the House the need to reconcile two objectives: simplification and reduced cost of accounting procedures for SMEs and the provision of adequate information for market players.</p>
      <p sl="es">The last point covered by Mr Radwan – and one with which I concur – is the need for global standards in a global environment. Therefore it is extremely important to reach agreements with the other major world financial markets, notably the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">This calls for greater dynamism and a more significant role for the European institutions, including this Parliament and all those listening today.</p>

The underlying premise here – and Mr Radwan pinpoints it in his report – is that an institution without a political mandate should nonetheless lay down a relatively large body of measures affecting the economy, some of which are binding. It is not enough to call for improved governance, or better framework conditions; political bodies also need to become more involved in this matter than they have been in the past. What we are doing here in Parliament constitutes a step in the right direction, but further steps must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also another aspect to consider. What is done here at the level of a regional organisation – in this case the European Union – should also be mirrored in the global context. So it is not a simply a matter of seeking to apply these rules to our region of the world alone.</p>

Parliament’s role is quite significant, and I believe that we should have this function too. However, I would like to express some doubt regarding the consideration of every technical detail and establishing standards. I do not find the description of the method of assessment and evaluation of realisable and non-realisable assets completely acceptable. That is why I doubt we should interfere, whether this is good or a bad method. We should wait for the experts to carry out the assessment. Meanwhile, the review of the standard of non-realisable assets and consultations on this issue has already started. Only then should we make our decision.

      <p sl="en">I would like to emphasise again that high-quality international accounting standards are crucial for the effective functioning of both the European and global capital markets. The process through which these standards are developed should therefore be subject to robust governance. It should be characterised by a high level of transparency and it should ensure a balanced consideration of stakeholder interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">The IASCF and the IASB have over recent years implemented significant reforms of their internal procedures but I cannot deny that further improvements are necessary. Moreover, I recognise that we in Europe should better organise ourselves to guide and provide input to the IASB standard-setting process.

Can I just repeat, as I have said many times about IFRSs for SMEs, when the IASB was going about this particular work I made it quite clear in a number of speeches that they should not assume that there was going to be automatic endorsement from the EU for this particular project. We would only recommend it if it was simple and effective and met the needs of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">They were told that when they were doing their work. Their first exposure draft has been presented. I then took the opportunity of telling them that it did not meet those criteria and in the present state of affairs I could not possibly even consider recommending it for SMEs because it was neither simple nor effective. That remains my position but, in line with what others have said and Mr Purvis in particular, it would probably be a good thing if there was a simple effective IFRS for SMEs – but only on that particular basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea is a good one. I do not want to knock the idea at all, but I am not going to endorse now or in the future anything for SMEs that is just more complex and which no one understands. It is not needed. I take this opportunity of repeating again in Parliament what I have said on many occasions about this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms van den Burg mentioned the question of XBRL. We are working with the securities regulator to get consensus on the technical standards for business data and as a result of this dialogue the Commission may take further measures aiming at interoperability of regulatory information systems. XBRL could allow investors to take full advantage of IFRS. Any steps towards requiring the use of XBRL in the European Union should be subject to a thorough impact analysis, including the economic assessment of costs and benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also discussed the matter with the SEC Chairman, Mr Chris Cox, during my recent visit to the United States and I support keeping this agenda point in our regulatory dialogue with the US authorities for the future. These standards will need to be internationally accepted, technologically independent and interoperable.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very exciting development and I know Ms van den Burg has recently had exposure to all this. I took the same opportunity myself some months ago – getting experts to show me how it actually works. I think it is something that is quite revolutionary and something to be welcomed, but we will not do anything about it just yet until we have done other work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Mitchell made an interesting point. I think the importance of what he said was that we do not want the IASB to come and say ‘an EU body or any other body’. We want to be an internationally accepted body – because this goal is well worth pursuing – and it needs to be an independent body. I think that should be taken as read, but with proper input from the various stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I remind everybody in the European Union that it was the EU which gave the IASB such importance. We were the largest jurisdiction to say as from 2005 that the IFRS would become the rule for listed companies. It was some years ago that this decision was made, together with the European Parliament, and that in itself gave greater importance to the IASB and to the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say – and I have said this repeatedly to the IASB also – that road testing – you can call it impact analysis – should be done before standards are adopted, particularly by the IASB, and with input from the EU and other bodies as well. We should not be waiting until the standards are endorsed by the IASB. We had the job here of either agreeing to them or rejecting them. We do not have the role of changing them. I think that they should be road tested enough beforehand to see if there are going to be problems, rather than finding out about serious problems after the whole IASB process has been gone through. We made this point repeatedly to the IASB. Hopefully, I think the new governance structures have been appreciated by most of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I accept that more work needs to be done in this particular area but that will lead to fewer problems in the future. Hopefully we will arrive some day at a situation where these things will be more or less automatic and not cause any great headaches for anybody because all the work will have been done previously. We will not have difficulties then.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for this debate, in which the main thrust of the report has certainly received support and alternatives have been outlined in various areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to pick up on two things. There is one point on which I am sure we all agree, and it has been made repeatedly today by speakers who fully support this general development, namely that the IFRS organisation has now taken some action, for example on governance issues, as a result of the pressure applied by this House – by the European Parliament – and by the European Union. There are times when we need to be quite blunt – and I am aware that some of my female colleagues have criticised me in that regard – because certain individuals who have appeared before this House in recent years have occasionally given the unmistakable impression that the European Parliament is of little interest to them. How little progress there has been is clear from the proposal on governance, where it is suggested that the future supervisory bodies may take advice only from persons they have appointed. All I can say is that anyone required in future to report to a parliament on how he or she voted on a particular point should make sure that a share of responsibility and a say in policy-making is part of the package. That is the first point.</p>
      <p sl="de">How little commitment there is on the matter of impact assessments is clear from current discussions, in which the IFRS organisation is still refusing to conduct them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to the question of standards for SMEs, I have something to say to all those who believe we should introduce them on a voluntary basis. Inspired here by John Purvis – John, this is for you – I intend to quote an independent commentator. Peter Holgate, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, writing in the German edition of the Financial Times, said the following:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘I don’t take the European position all that seriously. Even if they end up not endorsing it, various countries could adopt it in their national generally accepted accounting principles. If a few major players do that you have it brought in by a different door even if the EC doesn’t want to play ball.’</p>
      <p sl="de">At the end of the day, this means you have to assume that, once a few states have adopted these standards, you will have them imposed on a compulsory basis throughout the European Union. Such is the strategy of this organisation. PricewaterhouseCoopers has already indicated that they see this as a business model. That is why we need our own European set of standards for SMEs: we can build on the IFRS if that is appropriate but if it is not, then we will develop our own standards. It is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that we do not have standards foisted on us through the back door, which nobody wants but which would then become generally binding.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Commission’s priorities for 2009 are increased employment, climate change and a sustainable Europe. Employment in the European Union is especially deserving of attention.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Amsterdam Treaty was adopted in November 1997 during the Luxembourg summit. This created the basis for the formation of a European employment strategy. Due to the problem of unemployment in the Member States, where 17 million people were out of work at that time, this issue was made a priority. Nine years later, in 2006, in the enlarged European Union, 64.3% of people of working age were in employment. Denmark had the highest level of employment, Poland the lowest. A total of 7.9% of people of working age were unemployed. As a comparison, unemployment in the United States was 4.6%. Over the last year, 24 of the Member States recorded a drop in unemployment and three reported an increase. The largest decreases were seen in Poland, Bulgaria and Latvia and the largest increase in unemployment was in Estonia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the purpose for which the World Trade Organisation was created was to bring about free and multilateral trade. It was recognized that an open market based on principles of friendship and honesty is the key to stable economic growth and reducing world poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, for many people, the WTO is still something of a puzzle. This is due to the lack of transparency in its activities and inappropriate information being made public. The present reduced G4 and G6 working groups are often seen as meetings of the representatives of large countries that are imposing, or that want to impose, their will on other members.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another problem is the lack of technical and legal assistance from the WTO for less developed countries that do not gain any economic benefits from increased market liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Countries such as India, China or Brazil are treated as developing countries, as a result of which they can benefit from more advantageous conditions and various obligations. I believe this to be a mistake in WTO policy. The WTO does not take into account the massive potential of these countries and their resources. The countries take advantage of this fact and often use price dumping in trade relations, which is harmful to other countries. There should be a clearer division of developing countries that takes into account factors such as economic strength, economic development, GDP growth and growth in exports.</p>

      <p sl="pl">2008 is the year of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which is to come into force in 2009. It will give the European Union new powers and will have a significant impact on the Community budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The newly constituted Parliament and Commission will have to deal with a completely new budget procedure, to which the 2010 budget will be subject. For this reason it is exceptionally important to have clear agreement on changes to the relevant budgetary and legislative instruments by the end of this year in order to ensure a transparent framework for 2010. In addition, we need to intensify preparations for a wide-ranging review of all aspects of EU expenditure to enable the Commission to submit a report by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The solidarity principle must be a priority for next year, but finances have to be guaranteed to ensure its implementation. What worries me is that, given the room for manoeuvre available within the ceilings fixed by the multiannual financial frameworks, the Commission’s already existing priorities and the new priorities it has set cannot in practice be achieved simultaneously without the former suffering.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason the initial budget proposal should give a realistic picture of all the requirements for next year, taking into account Parliament’s demand that all amounts allocated to pilot projects that are of general benefit to Europe’s citizens should be spent.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Let us remember that, alongside the debate on the Community budget for 2009, there is another debate on reviewing the entire EU budget, as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement. The exact form of this review has yet to be defined, but we are concerned about some of the objectives already indicated for it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, the Council has already announced its intention to establish a realistic and rigorous level of payments and that the level of its commitment and payment appropriations must be carefully analysed in relation to the Community’s capacity to absorb them, which suggests that further cuts in the structural policy and cohesion headings, which we oppose, are more likely. We take a different view and believe that a detailed analysis should be made of the failure to spend the full amount allocated under these budget headings, and that measures should be taken to ensure their strict implementation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Meanwhile, the proposal insists on increasing allocations for external action, to provide resources compatible with the EU’s ambitions. The rejection of our proposed amendment has shed light on what this really means.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the budget for 2009 must take into account the special circumstances affecting next year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, the budgetary consequences of the expected entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty as well as the European elections and the formation of the new European Parliament and European Commission will be a challenge for continuity in the EU’s legislative and budget activities. At the same time, this is the year in which the 2007-2013 financial perspective is to be fully implemented, following two years of ‘getting up to speed’, which were affected by delays in legislation and, as a consequence, a delay in the start of the long-term programmes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The emphasis placed on financing innovative policies as well as on the European Union’s ambitions in foreign policy is completely understandable. This cannot, however, happen at the expense of the cohesion policy, which is enormously important at the moment because of differences in development between various countries and regions. Section 3 of the report, which deals with the principle of solidarity, describes how the Structural Funds can be used properly and transparently. This takes on particular significance in the light of the budget review planned for 2008-2009, which has consequences for EU finances after 2013. This is yet another important issue for budgetary policy in 2009.</p>

Nevertheless, we must be careful to consider which combination of instruments will be particularly effective. I am a firm believer in emissions rights trading and am in principle not against a carbon dioxide tax. However, a great deal of thought must go into weighing them up against each other, and as the proposals were set against each other I found it appropriate to take a stand.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The issues raised in the report by Mr Radwan seem highly technical but they are very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The public authorities should certainly have a say in the definition of accounting standards, because these have such an impact on all the actors in the economy and even on national tax revenue. It is not right for a private body to be set up de facto as a real legislator, without any political control, especially since the technical legitimacy of the IASB is increasingly being called into question by its approach to the issues involved, which is more theoretical than professional. Besides that, its geographical and professional composition leaves something to be desired. Yes, new standards should only be adopted if they are useful and necessary, after a careful cost-benefit analysis. Yes, the role of the IASB should be confined to companies quoted on the stock exchange and should not include SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the 'fair value' principle, it favours a short-term approach and makes financial results the dominant factor in company management. It increases financiarisation of the economy and volatility of the markets. The European Union should refuse to apply that standard. However, the position of the rapporteur on that subject is not all that clear. We are therefore abstaining on his report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since January 2005, EU publicly traded companies have been obliged to use international accounting standards for their consolidated financial statements.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These standards have been developed by a private organisation (the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASCF/IASB)) that is funded by private sources (mainly companies in the same field) and not subject to any public control.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although the present report includes aspects that we have reservations about, it does propose certain measures to deal with the situation and is cautious about the possibility of applying this type of international accounting standards to small and medium-sized companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is important to be clear that it is not possible to cure the patient with palliative measures that aim to minimise the consequences of financial speculation and prevent the occurrence of situations that might lead to the collapse of the international financial system, as a way of perpetuating the increasing liberalisation of capital movements.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have to tackle the root of the problem: the increasing control of the economy by finance capital and the increasing level of financial speculation, with the consequent flight of productive investment.

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will, without doubt, make it easier to compare company financial reports and, as a result, will make it possible for investors to take better decisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like, however, to point out that the requirements governing small and medium sized enterprises differ from the requirements of investors in capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason I agree with the rapporteur that the IFRS proposed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for SMEs are too complicated. I would emphasise that I shall consistently oppose solutions that, instead of making things easier, create additional obstacles for companies. The IASB proposal was prepared with fairly large SMEs in mind (over 50 employees). At this point I would like to mention some data published recently by EUROSTAT, according to which companies employing less than 50 workers constitute 98.7% of all the companies active in the European Union, and just 1.1%, about 210 000 companies, are SMEs with over 50 employees.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would point out that I do not oppose the idea of IFRS for small and medium sized enterprises as such.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Zimbabwe's President Mugabe was once the hero of the liberation struggle. Thanks to him former Southern Rhodesia gave way to a new state of Zimbabwe which gave a democratic voice to the black majority population, after the end of British colonial rule and in the teeth of a white-led policy of apartheid which rebelled against that colonial authority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For years Mugabe was an incredibly moderate ruler. He did not pursue the pressing imperative of redistributing land ownership. He was radical only in his objection to homosexuals. Only when he was in danger of losing power did he remember his earlier promises about land reform. Since then his ill-considered actions have reduced his country's economy to total ruin. The redistribution of agricultural land did not follow a proper plan, but was done entirely arbitrarily, with his most aggressive supporters grabbing the land for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Worse still is the way he has treated his political opponents. They have been relentlessly intimidated and attacked but have so far managed to survive. Last time elections were held there was already the suspicion that the results were rigged. This time the opposition won the parliamentary elections, but it seems that the proposed recount is designed to rob them of their victory. The result of the presidential election has been kept secret for a full month already, so the size of Mugabe's defeat remains unknown.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the last few days he has declared enthusiastically that he will never change anything in his country. He can only make good that promise by violence and oppression. He will do it using a shipload of imported Chinese arms. Given these circumstances it is reasonable for the outside world to concern itself with this domestic conflict. Support for refugees, support for the opposition and pressure on the ruling party are essential ways of achieving what Mugabe himself always claimed to want, namely political power for the majority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I first of all express my disappointment that the Council is not represented for this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is almost a month since elections were held in Zimbabwe. There can be little doubt that those elections were won by the Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe and his henchmen should now be out of office, but we have heard virtually nothing about the election results except that Mugabe’s people are once more reacting with violence and are desperately trying to fix the election outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">For years now, we have pointed to Zimbabwe as the great shame on the face of Africa, a testimony to the effects of tyranny, corruption and exploitation by one man’s appalling regime. Mugabe has destroyed a once prosperous country. Yet, during this time, over all those years, other African leaders have stood by and either done nothing or else they have applauded the tyrant whenever they had the opportunity. What a disgrace! And what a scandal this has been. And what a tragedy – not just for the people of Zimbabwe, but for Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">For all those years, the first key to Zimbabwe’s fate has been held by South Africa, yet Thabo Mbeki has not only failed properly to discharge his responsibilities as a mediator but he has blatantly sided with Mugabe. The world watched dumbstruck when Mbeki announced a few days ago that there was no crisis in Zimbabwe, just normal electoral politics.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the EU has at least imposed targeted sanctions on the Mugabe regime, it went out of its way to ensure that no one took them seriously, even inviting Mugabe, banned from travel to EU countries, to its EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon last December for reasons that were wholly false. What diplomatic or economic effort has really been made to persuade other African countries to do the decent thing over Zimbabwe? The answer is very little.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, there is still time to do the right thing. Jacob Zuma, the ANC leader, has now called for action on Zimbabwe. In our motion for a resolution today we are calling on men of goodwill in the governing Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe to see the light and recognise that a transformation is on the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now is the time for us to make our voice heard. Let us bring about that democratic change that at last is required for the sake of the people of Zimbabwe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, both the political situation and internal security in Zimbabwe took a sudden turn for the worse after the March parliamentary and presidential elections in that country. The very fact that the results of the elections have not yet been announced illustrates the breakdown of the rule of law and it also shows the totalitarian nature of authority in that African state.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, in Africa, democracy itself is under serious threat. The regime has again used force against the opposition and against the democratic aspirations of Zimbabwe’s inhabitants. For this reason a decisive reaction is needed from the European Union and this should include our Parliament. We should react to the situation, but we should also condemn the action of China, which, by sending a cargo ship full of arms to the African coast, is trying to support the Mugabe regime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason I am pleased to support the clause in our joint motion for a resolution calling on China to stop sending arms to Zimbabwe. Only in this way will it be possible to reduce the number of victims of the state terror to which the citizens of that country are being subjected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, following many years of British colonial rule and a period of apartheid dictatorship by Ian Smith, the then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was led to independence by a group of freedom-fighting persons, including Mr Mugabe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nobody can deny the contribution of these people to achieving freedom for Zimbabwe but, as is so often the case, excessive and long-lasting power, along with opportunism and an uncontrolled appetite for personal materialistic gain, soon corrupted the altruistic spirit of freedom and democracy and turned the ruling regime of Mugabe into an oppressive governing body with no forward vision and with excessive totalitarian manifestations. The result has been the international isolation of Zimbabwe and the continuing slide of the state into poverty and corruption misery.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the recent elections the people of Zimbabwe demonstrated their desire for a much-needed change, but the Mugabe regime does not want to relinquish power and it is now seriously risking throwing the country into anarchy and civil war.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through this motion for a resolution we are sending the message that the wish of the people of Zimbabwe, expressed through the electoral process, must be respected. We are also making sure that those in Africa who say that they really care about the situation in Zimbabwe fully assume their responsibilities, view the reality of the situation, assess Mugabe, not as he was many years ago but as he is today, and act decisively to bring about democratic transition in Zimbabwe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in the light of events, I feel that the situation in Zimbabwe certainly deserves our consideration at this urgent sitting. I therefore add my voice, how could I not, to the voices of those who have already condemned the violence on the part of government forces against opposition groups, journalists and human rights supporters</p>
      <p sl="es">I also hope that this resolution will at least help to support those who are trying from inside and outside the country to restore democratic process to the situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, there is one particular point to which I would like to draw attention and it concerns the famous case of the Chinese vessel An Yue Jiang, carrying 77 tonnes of arms and munitions destined for Zimbabwe, which was forced to leave the South African port of Durban after dockworkers refused to unload the cargo and a court ruled that the arms could not be transported through South Africa.</p>
      <p sl="es">According to my information, the vessel is now seeking another port at which to offload its cargo, although it seems, in view of the opposition in the area to accepting the shipment, that the vessel might return to China without accomplishing its mission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Once again, it is clear that the vessel should never have been allowed to sail and that all governments need to get together to devise an international treaty on arms transfers as soon as possible because, unfortunately, there are many places in the world like Zimbabwe, which should never be allowed to receive arms or munitions of any description.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let this example act as a spur towards the negotiation of a forceful and legally binding ATT (Arms Trade Treaty), which so many NGOs in the IANSA network have been calling for for years, as indeed has this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it will shortly be a month since presidential elections took place in Zimbabwe. Surely this was ample time to count the vote and announce the result. Currently a recount continues in 23 constituencies at the request of the ruling Zanu-PF Party. There are serious concerns regarding how ballot boxes have been stored and it cannot be ruled out that ballot papers are being tampered with in the process of this recount. Exit polls suggested that a second round would be necessary in the presidential race. If Mr Mugabe now announces his victory, it must be questioned. Let us hope that a second round will indeed take place.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the international community must keep up the pressure to ensure that this round is as free and fair as possible.

Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited absolutely under international law: for example, under Article 5 of the African Charter of Human and People’s Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Recently every single company in the country has been nationalised. In addition, life expectancy in Zimbabwe is among the lowest in the world: 37 years for men and 34 for women.

      <p sl="pl">The blockade on the publication of the results of the presidential elections and the accompanying repression of the opposition are an unacceptable form of stifling the democratic aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. The fact that on 14 April 2008 the High Court in Zimbabwe rejected an urgent application from the opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change, for the electoral commission to release the results of the elections shows the dependence of the judiciary on the current incumbent of the presidential office, Robert Mugabe, who is afraid of losing power.</p>

      <p sl="pl">To supply arms to this country at this time is to encourage the possibility of an outbreak of civil war and is equally deserving of condemnation.

How many times have we stood here impotently railing against the way in which Mugabe oppresses his people? We have not always been unanimous about everything, but on Zimbabwe we do have some kind of consensus.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The disgraceful spectacle of the recent elections is proof yet again that this unscrupulous dictator does not give a damn about democracy. The policy of ethnic cleansing against white farmers continues unabated. Mugabe holds the opposition, the international community, and his own people in contempt. The weakest in Zimbabwe are the first to suffer, but we have known that for years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And yet the European Community rolled out the red carpet for this man last December at the EU-African summit in Lisbon. Only Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown stuck to his guns and boycotted this unsavoury little get-together. We all know it, but the nub of the lamentable situation is this. Mugabe knows that he has support. He knows he is backed by a number of fellow-heads of state, or shall we say fellow-dictators in Africa, who dismiss any criticism of his criminal policy as 'neo-colonialism'. South Africa's role is especially perfidious here. Until such time as the African Union unequivocally condemns him, Mugabe will carry on with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mugabe knows he also has the backing of China, which wants to take over Europe's role in Africa and does it by telling corrupt heads of state that China will not give them any grief about human rights and good governance.

      <p sl="en">What is the purpose of elections? The purpose is the democratic election of a government. This means the voting process must be free and fair, the votes must be counted, the results published and the people’s choice respected. That is not the case in Mugabe’s Zimbabwe.</p>

We must listen to the warnings of religious leaders who appeal to our sense of responsibility since they are afraid that this could result in a very violent crisis of genocidal dimensions. This is also a test for international bodies and we must put pressure there – the SADC, the African Union and the UN.</p>

In later years, the slogan was turned around to make a double-edged joke: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Rhodesia’. Today the poster might well read: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Zimbabwe’ – referring not to the famous stonework, but to ruined hopes of prosperity and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe the European Union has a duty to use the current situation – in which, despite manipulation of various kinds, the Zimbabwean Opposition’s courage has, after all, won it a major victory – to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important African state. The people there have suffered enough. We must, however, find ways of supporting them that are not liable to be interpreted as neo-colonialism. So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress – although it needs to do more! That is why I particularly welcome the brave example set by the dockworkers.

      <p sl="en">We also welcome the redeployment by the SADC of an electoral observation mission to cover the ongoing electoral process immediately and until its completion, while regretting that the EU has not been invited to deploy its own election observation mission.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the framework of his participation in the SADC summit on poverty, held in Mauritius on 19 April, Commissioner Michel took the opportunity to meet most Presidents or Prime Ministers from SADC Member States to discuss the crisis in Zimbabwe. He thanked them for their efforts and encouraged them to strengthen their engagement to find acceptable solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to confirm the Commission’s willingness to continue to make use of any opportunity for dialogue in order to find a solution to the Zimbabwe crisis. In the meantime, the Commission and Member States continue to provide unprecedented levels of humanitarian aid to Zimbabweans.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the darkest aspects of the theocratic Iranian regime is its misogyny. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, the Iranian authorities have successively eliminated all the most important women's rights. Stoning, mutilation and violation of privacy and of the most basic rights are now the rule. Society is reacting increasingly clearly and forcefully to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, the movement for a million signatures that began organising around two years ago in Iran is one of the most important manifestations of Iranian civil society’s wish to demonstrate its opposition to the regime in power.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the last two years, we have witnessed around 100 prison sentences and other punishments meted out to people who have signed the movement's petition. Today, after we submitted our motion, we were informed by various human rights organisations that three women activists from this movement – Nashrin Afzali, Nahid Jafari and Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh – have been sentenced to suspended prison sentences and whipping. This is an intolerable situation and I appeal to all my fellow Members to show their repudiation of the situation and express their support for Iranian women.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Iran is a country where only people prepared to be terrorised by the military and conservative theologians can bear to live. Freedom, democracy and human rights have no meaning there. They do hold elections, but candidates have to be endorsed by the conservative clergy, so dissenters are by definition excluded. Many Iranians have fled the regime of terror in their country and many of them would no longer be alive if they had not done so. We should find room for these refugees in Europe instead of sending them back or treating them as terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time there is no denying that a section of the Iranian population approves of the killing of homosexuals, discrimination against women and the suppression of ethnic minorities. That section abhorred the western decadence in their country during the time of the Pahlavi dynasty, who were driven into exile in the late 1970s after making Iran an extension of America and Europe. There was no talk of democracy then either, and opponents of the regime were persecuted or exiled. The mistakes of the West were largely responsible for the present-day regime of terror coming to power. If Iran had had a real chance of becoming a modern nation under Prime Minister Mossadeq in the early 1950s, it would never have become a breeding ground for the rulers of today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are movements for change in Iran, but they are subjected to generalised harassment. Mrs Khadijeh Moghaddam was seized on 8 April and charged with 'the spreading of propaganda against the state, disruption of public opinion and actions against national security.' She has since been released, but the tight restrictions on women simply continue. We must show solidarity with the oppressed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, as is evident from the resolution, coercive measures are being used in Iran to try and silence those who speak up for women’s rights there. They are arrested, interrogated and sentenced to prison. Some are even threatened with stoning. The work of NGOs has been made very difficult and there are restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly. Furthermore, at the beginning of January Zanan magazine, which spoke for equality, was closed down.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also worrying that Iran has still not ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Iranian human rights lawyer, Mehrangiz Kar, has said that Iran’s legal system is incompatible with the UN Convention on women’s rights, because its constitution cannot go against Sharia law. Most Muslim countries, however, have ratified the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The question arises as to whether Iran’s decision-makers and authorities believe that politically active women who are critical of the system pose a real threat to Iranian society. These persistent and courageous women represent a huge force for change. It is important that the EU shows its support for these Iranians who are fighting for fundamental human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there are serious breaches of human rights in Iran, in particular the threat to stone nearly ten women to death – I am speaking here of Iran, Khayrieh, Kobra N, Fatemeh, Ashraf Kalhori, Shamameh Ghorbani, Leyla Ghomi, Hajar and the sisters Zohreh and Azar Kabiriniat, and other people, too. The use of the death penalty for children and for those who talk about women’s rights demands a strong reaction from the democratic world. The arrest of those involved in the ‘million signatures’ campaign shows how society is being prevented from exercising its right to speak out on important issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These actions must be condemned. European Union bodies should monitor the human rights situation in Iran. We would like to see a group of observers sent to Iran and for them to prepare a detailed report that the European Parliament can consider, so that it can define its own position and put forward its proposals for measures that could help to improve the human rights situation in Iran.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, however much one tries to be understanding about the different society, lifestyle and circumstances prevailing in a deeply Muslim state like Iran, one cannot help but feel shocked and angry at the grossly undemocratic and brutal treatment of women in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some examples include the exclusion of women from most senior state offices and appointment as judges, the discriminatory rights of women in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance, the fact that evidence given in court by women carries only half the weight of that given by a man, the legal age of marriage of women at just 13 years and the condemnation of women to severe and degrading punishment, and even death, by primitive and barbaric means, even for such presumed crimes as having an extramarital relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of the governing regime of Iran making efforts to improve the situation, attempts are presently under way to make matters worse. An example is the draft bill on family protection, which is currently under consideration and which aims at further legitimising polygamy, temporary marriage and the unilateral right of men to arbitrary divorce and child custody. In addition, the Iranian authorities are conducting an ever-increasing campaign of repression of female activists and women’s rights defenders in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call upon the Iranian regime to try to free itself from religious fanaticism and long superseded, failed political philosophies and, using common sense, to try to bring its country back into the 21st century, rather than plunging it further into the dark ages of the extreme Muslim totalitarianism of the past.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I was aware of the case of Mokarrameh Ebrahimi due to the international campaign waged at the time by Amnesty International and Stop Stoning Forever, the purpose of which was to obtain the release of this woman who had been sentenced to death by stoning for having had an extra-marital relationship.</p>
      <p sl="es">The good news is that thanks, at least in part, to that campaign, Ebrahimi was freed on 17 March 2008 after spending eleven years in prison. The bad news is that her partner was less fortunate and was stoned to death one year ago, just as least ten other women and two men are threatened with death by stoning in Iran at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Sadly, this is not just an isolated incident in a country where breaches of human rights, including women’s rights, is achieving disturbing records. Executions doubled in 2007, making Iran the country with most executions per capita after Saudi Arabia and, together with Yemen, these are the three countries in which there were most executions of persons under the age of eighteen.</p>
      <p sl="es">Since the start of the Stop Stoning Forever campaign, in October 2006, six people have escaped death by stoning, others have been granted a reprieve and many cases are under review.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I should point out that a great deal of persecution and repression is being suffered by those who dare to be human rights activists in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Islamic Consultative Assembly is currently revising the Iranian Penal Code, but even so, the sentence of death by stoning is to be replaced, in the most favourable cases, by other methods of execution or whipping.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this imposing building here in Strasbourg is named after Louise Weiss, who fell foul of the police and the courts in the democratically enlightened France of the inter-war years because she campaigned for women’s suffrage.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot, of course, compare that situation to the totalitarian dictatorship in Iran, but the memory should serve to teach us Europeans a certain degree of humility. The regime in Iran is an unacceptable, totalitarian one, but Iran is a big, multifaceted country, where the forces of reform are steadily gathering strength. The initiators of this petition, for example, are among the reform movements to which we must lend our emphatic support, and which have now spread to include even members of the Khomeini family.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are already more women to be found in politics, in administration and in the academic world in Iran than in most other Islamic or Asian states. That may not tally with the clichéd view but it is a fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to build on this plurality in Iran in order to bring about the ultimate downfall of the unacceptable, totalitarian regime there. That is a tremendous challenge for us as Europeans. I am therefore very grateful to my colleague, Albert Dess, for helping me on Monday to keep this important item on the agenda – because, ladies and gentlemen, we need to make Iran one of our priorities in the context of Parliament’s work to support human rights!</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, the situation of women in Iran is serious. Religion is often used as an excuse for violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is humiliating to learn that even today women can be punished by lashing or even with the death penalty. It is essential for Iran to sign the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as soon as possible. This important document has already been signed by 185 countries. Iran, however, is a genuine ‘blot’ in the region because all the countries which border it have already acceded to the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="et">I warmly welcome the release of the champion of the fight against discrimination against women, Khadijeh Moghaddam. But let us be honest, she had to spend nine long days in a detention cell. The one-million-signature campaign she initiated was a forceful step towards establishing women’s rights. It is unacceptable for women ever to be jailed for fighting for equal rights. Violence against women in Iran must stop; women must have their say on all issues. Iran cannot class itself as an exception in the world’s global village.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for almost 30 years, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a major menace to human rights and democracy. Women have been the first target of this extremist branch of Islam. Their rights have been hijacked by the mullahs’ regime. Even young girls are not exceptions, and a nine-year-old girl is treated as an adult and punished by flogging, execution and even stoning.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, many women have not complied with the regime. It is encouraging to see that the main democratic opposition movement, the National Council of Resistance, is led by a woman like Mrs Maryam Rajavi. Resolutions are good, but they are not enough.

      <p sl="it">I received a veiled rebuke from the government at the time because I was told that clear-cut and explicit positions could not be taken for reasons of realpolitik. I say this because this debate should ultimately be looking at a fundamental point: while we in this House set great store by the humanitarian commitment of Europe as a whole and of the European Parliament, concrete pressures to do with oil, self-interest and opportunism run counter to that commitment.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission shares Members’ concern regarding Ms Khadijeh Moghaddam and the cases of women and human rights defenders harassed by the Iranian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Moghaddam is a leader of the One Million Signatures petition campaign, which lobbies to change Iranian laws which contradict the principles of gender equality and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the news of Ms Modghaddam’s release, albeit on a high bail. However, we must underline the fact that two other members of the signature campaign, Ms Hana Abdi and Ms Ronak Safazadeh, have been detained since autumn 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, we deplore the recent sentencing of four more members of the campaign for allegedly acting against national security, following their participation in a rally outside a Tehran courtroom two years ago: Ms Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh to two years’ suspended imprisonment and Ms Nashrin Afzali, Ms Nahid Jafari and Ms Minoo Mortazi to six months’ suspended imprisonment and 10 lashes. We vigorously condemn such sentences, which can only be seen as part of the ongoing effort to intimidate and humiliate these peaceful women campaigners.</p>
      <p sl="en">The campaign for women’s rights and equality is very important and significant in the Iranian context. Each of these courageous women deserves our full support. I call on the Iranian authorities to release unconditionally Ms Abdi and Ms Safazadeh and drop all charges against them and their fellow women’s rights campaigners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alas, many other human rights defenders are at risk in Iran. I specifically call on the authorities to release unconditionally Mr Mansour Ossanlou and Mr Emadedin Baghi and to end the harassment, intimidation and political persecution of human rights defenders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission reiterates its concern about the closure, two months ago, of the independent women’s magazine Zanan. The Commission appeals to the Iranian authorities to re-allow the publication of Zanan. The EU will consider Iran’s attitude towards Zanan, as well as towards the women’s campaign for equal rights, as an indicator of its willingness to seriously engage in the improvement of the human rights situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully comply with its obligations under international conventions, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We also recall that, when standing for election at the UN Human Rights Council, Iran affirmed that it was considering accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has raised issues relating to human rights, including women’s rights and the promotion of gender equality, with the Iranian authorities and will continue to do so.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, colonial rule in the former territories of French West Africa and French Central Africa came to an end between 1958 and 1960. This was not the outcome of a protracted conflict and the resulting emergence of a collective national consciousness, but rather a way of preventing the development of liberation movements. It was a top-down rather than a bottom-up process. From French overseas departments they first became autonomous territories and then independent states.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With the exception of Guinea (Conakry), French influence has nevertheless always remained greater in these states than in other former colonies. The big desert state of Chad still has a French military presence and that has certainly influenced who was allowed to rule the country and who was not. This powerful European influence has not led to the development of European standards of democracy and human rights in these countries. The states and their national borders derive not from domestic movements which shaped an independent state, but simply from the colonial past.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This means that ethnic differences can lead to ethnic confrontations. In countries like these that means a continuing struggle for power, over who are the first-class citizens and who the second-class citizens. Ethnic and geographical diversity is often not reflected, or only poorly reflected, in the composition of the government. The problems this causes cannot, in my Group's view, simply be resolved by stationing a new body of European troops there. There has always been a military presence there, and it has made the present situation worse rather than better. The answer lies not in stabilising the current situation, which only benefits the current rulers, but in making space for change from the bottom up.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in the draft resolution we refer to the Cotonou Agreement and, specifically, to the section on humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I must however remind you about an unfortunate occurrence during the last ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Ljubljana, which took place one month ago. The ACP side rejected the Assembly’s compromise resolution on Chad. What is more, those promoting the rejection of this resolution were delegates from countries that are Chad’s neighbours, even though their concerns had been taken into account in the compromise text. It was difficult for us to understand why our partners from Africa decided to reject this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that the European Parliament resolution, which we will adopt in a few minutes’ time, will fill the gap created by the absence of the much-anticipated ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly resolution. I think we can all agree with the statement by Chad’s President Idriss Deby that looking after 300 000 Sudanese refugees and 170 000 internal refugees in Chad is a heavy burden. European society is aware of this, and this is why 14 European Union countries have decided to carry out the UN Security Council mandate and are beginning to send 4 000 soldiers to Chad.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are pleased that the European Union has taken responsibility and showed solidarity in this way, even though the scope of this solidarity could be wider. Most of the 14 countries that have decided to take part in the mission, including, to name but a few, Ireland, Finland, Romania and Poland, have no historic or economic links with Chad. These countries, in directing assistance to Chad, have displayed not just solidarity, but also selflessness in their desire to help defenceless civilians, victims of the conflict in Darfur and of the internal strife in Chad, refugees in camps on the Saudi-Chad border and staff in humanitarian missions working in the region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that this mission will be effective in resolving the conflict and will help the people of Chad and Sudan, and we wish the people of Chad successful, free, democratic and transparent elections in 2009.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Torture, imprisonment and various types of repression are systematically used against the opposition. There are restrictions on free speech, and the right to a free trial is also limited. The security forces as well as armed groups from Sudan threaten civilians and attack humanitarian organisations, especially in the eastern part of Chad.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Chad there are over 250 000 refugees from Sudan and about 57 000 refugees from the Central African Republic, as well as refugees from Darfur. The conflict in Darfur has spilled over into Chadian territory. The armed conflict is accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe: there is not enough food for refugees, there are sudden increases in the price of food, barely 20% of children attend school, children are forced into the armed forces, and violence against children is becoming increasingly widespread, especially sexually-motivated attacks on girls.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is vital to enable refugees to return to their own homes. It is vital to stop not just the armed conflict in Chad but also the fall-out from the crisis in Darfur. Only a resolution to the armed conflicts can possibly give a chance to help the 4.5 million people in Darfur and Eastern Chad. Only an end to war can make it possible to reduce violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Images of skeletal women sitting outside their burnt-out houses with hungry children in their arms, images that were common in Poland and in other European countries during the Second World War, are now a daily reality in Chad and Sudan.

Civil conflict, guerrilla warfare, military coups, religious and ethnic divisions, combined with a hostile, semi-desert environment and a problematic regional neighbourhood, have led to almost continuous unrest in the country. Consequently – and despite the fact that Chad is rich in gold, uranium and oil – Chad is a state suffering from severe poverty and resultant poor health and social conditions.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the resolution highlights the two areas of the crisis which the government and international agencies need to focus their attention on. Firstly, the humanitarian crisis is widespread and for a long time now the aid organisations there have been sending back reports about the growing numbers of internal refugees. The poor levels of security in the refugee camps, the widespread sexual violence, and the difficulty of delivering food aid have made the situation even more critical. Secondly, there are massive restrictions on freedom of speech and many journalists have had to leave Chad for fear of arrest. Supporters of the political opposition have been threatened and have disappeared. This fact often remains in the shadow of the humanitarian crisis, although if things were to improve in this area it would be one important step along the road to a more stable regime.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A genuine solution will of course require strong political will and concrete action on a large scale. Just as important, however, is the need to invest time and effort in the children of Chad and their future by trying hard to prevent them from being recruited into armed gangs of insurgents and investing in their basic education, which could include human rights studies, for example.</p>

      <p sl="et">My speech too links up with the previous speaker’s. I also wanted to raise a point of the utmost importance to today’s agenda and it is precisely the situation of children in crisis hotspots. A large number, if not the majority of the hundreds of thousands of people who been left homeless are children. And what is their everyday life like? We have all seen the dispiriting images on our television screens.</p>
      <p sl="et">The European Union has an obligation to show solidarity with the whole nation, of course, but we must strive to focus our attention on the children because they cannot look after themselves. It is depressing that only one in five children in Chad attends school and that thousands upon thousands of them carry weapons.</p>
      <p sl="et">I fully support the call for a plan to make human rights an integral part of the school curriculum. It is important for the government of Chad to do all it can to prevent the recruitment of children by rebel groups; the importance of the role of EUFOR will prove crucial here in, for example, communicating with community leaders and focusing their attention on the situation of children in this area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the subject of today’s debate is breaches of human rights in Chad. The situation there is as dramatic as in Darfur, Sudan or the Central African Republic, where, in addition to the conflicts fuelled by ethnic, language or religious differences, there are also other conflicts of interest, especially to do with politics and oil.</p>
      <p sl="pl">African countries that are economically poor and poorly developed, even though they may be rich in natural resources, including crude oil, precious gemstones and metals, become not just an arena for trading in these resources or in drugs, but an eager market for the sale of arms, one of the principal causes of human rights abuses. In an atmosphere of growing conflict and war, many unscrupulous local and foreign traders exploit this situation, enriching themselves at the cost of chaos, refugees and the suffering of millions of innocent people, and even genocide, rape and the exploitation of women and children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This situation is made worse by the passivity of the international community, which is controlled and exploited by great powers that play out their interests on the global stage. Humanitarian missions of various types can do little to help, and sometimes even go against their initial objectives and calling. Such a situation appears hopeless, as long as life and human dignity lose out to practical materialism, liberalism and the growing civilisation of death, which is sometimes propagated even by so-called humanitarian organisations providing education in the name of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For these reasons, various resolutions and reports may help to ease the consciences of their authors, but will not improve the situation in Africa, until African leaders and the great powers, from both the east and the west, stop benefiting from war and the growing hatred in the African continent.</p>

    <intervention id="4-229" speaker_id="28377" name="Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the signing, a year ago, of an agreement between all the political parties in Chad on strengthening the democratic process, and despite the later non-aggression pact with the Sudanese authorities, the situation is still highly charged. Government forces regularly clash with rebels from armed groups from Darfur, who attack transports of humanitarian aid. The state of emergency has been used to imprison the opposition with impunity and to impose savage restrictions on press freedom and freedom of speech.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of particular concern is the worsening humanitarian situation in the country where, as a result of the conflict in Darfur and its cross-border consequences, there are over 300 000 refugees in 12 camps along the eastern frontier between Chad and Sudan. As a result of continuing battles, supplies of food to the camps are interrupted, and refugees are left to vegetate in terrible conditions. Following mass displacement, the civilian population is prey to aggression and breaches of fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the light of the obvious impasse in stabilising the situation in Chad, international institutions should strengthen their efforts to promote dialogue between all sides in the conflict. Only a global agreement has any chance of averting a humanitarian disaster in the country. It is vital to begin the European forces mission as quickly as possible in order to step up humanitarian activities in the region and to provide increased protection for the civilian population and for refugees.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to refer again to the Ljubljana resolution, which our African colleagues voted against. I was really disappointed and saddened. I think and hope that values for Africa do not come from China, with its aggressive economic invasion that we are witnessing at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is impossible to know how to treat our African partners when they treat Chad in this way, but one thing is fairly clear: we have to persuade them about human rights. That is the only choice we have. It seems that this will be a long and costly process, but there is no other choice.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I also want my voice to be heard in the debate about the complex situation in which the people in Chad find themselves. As we know from the latest information, apart from 300 000 refugees in eastern parts of the country there are 200 000 internally displaced people who live in these camps in conditions barely fit for humans, facing a humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">When we take into account the lack of food and medicine, the dramatic misuse of the fact that these people have lost their freedom, the spread of drug abuse and diseases among the people kept in these conditions, we have no other option than to call for the support of the democratic process and for the defeat of the rebels with the help of the European forces.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though agreement had been reached on a joint motion, it was rejected by the African side at the Joint Assembly in Ljubljana.</p>
      <p sl="it">The drama lies in the reasons that were put forward: because the Chad delegation was not there, or so it was said. That was clearly a pretext and that pretext was instrumental, but it served to hide the reality of events, the reasons for which the African side rejected the resolution. What that means, in substance, is that political opportunism prevailed over fundamental human rights and the protection and guarantee of the fundamental freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the value of Europe – and the new history that Europe is creating – is that it not just observes, but that it also fights to ensure that it is not expediency but human reasons that prevail over all the deceptions of politics. In my view, that is what we should be supporting and affirming and what should once again become a plan for the very life of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few short years ago I was with a delegation in Chad, in the aftermath of their civil war and the violence, looking at the optimism that was coming from the arrival of oil and the pipeline. The wealth of that country was hitherto the mango trees of a village, nothing more, and oil was bringing opportunity to this country. The international community was supervising that in such a way that we had hope that this would bring stability and wealth and a future to this country. Now we have a mess, and we have a mess partly because of what has come in from outside – Darfur and so on – and, I have to say, partly from what has come from inside – the corruption, the poor governance and the violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result, it is the people of Chad who are suffering, and we must urge everyone – internationally, nationally and locally – to work together to bring this crisis to an end, and then build for the future again.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, this week we have discussed China-Africa relations. The situation in Chad is but one example of how oil can become a reason for buying weapons. Unless we can urge China, which is a member of the UN Security Council, to change its foreign and trade policy from the so-called ‘no conditions’ policy to a ‘conditional’ policy and fall into step with us, we will bitterly regret our lack of resources to provide sufficient help to hundreds of thousands of refugees and injured persons.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we fully support the call of Members for a restoration of the political process in Chad and for a diplomatic resolution to the tensions between Chad and Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the internal political process, we welcome the nomination of a new Prime Minister, Mr Abbas. In our view, his declaration of 18 April was a first promising signal which could lead to the normalisation of the relations between the government and the non-armed opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are, therefore, hopeful that the constitution of the new, inclusive government of 23 April, where four key ministerial posts have been given to non-armed opposition parties coming from la Coordination des partis politiques pour la défense de la Constitution (CPDC), will pave the way for the relaunching of a more comprehensive dialogue on the basis of the political agreement of 13 August 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Michel was amongst the first to express concern about the disappearance of members of the opposition following the attempted coup of early February and to call for the immediate release of any opposition leaders held in custody by the Chadian authorities. Like many of the speakers today, we are still vocal concerning the need to shed light on the situation of Mr Ibni Saleh, spokesperson of the CPDC.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard the European Commission, through its role as an international observer to the National Commission of Inquiry, is seeking to develop clarity about these disappearances, which will help engender trust in the political process.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the political process, through our 10th European Development Fund and Instrument for Stability we are developing Chad’s capacity to hold legislative elections in late 2009, as envisaged by the 13 August 2007 agreement. This includes support for electoral preparations and the conducting of a national census. Chad has also been included as a country to be followed up in view of a possible EU election observation mission in 2009, if all conditions for such a deployment are met.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the relations between Chad and Sudan, the issue of the rebel groups can only be considered as part of the wider situation, and we are encouraged by the recent Libreville meeting of the Contact Group established under the Dakar Accord between Chad and Sudan. We believe that such sustained diplomatic efforts are essential to calm down the two countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our humanitarian assistance in East Chad is ongoing (an average of EUR 30 million each year), and needs are adequately covered. Nevertheless, to complement humanitarian aid and the increase in security of refugee and internally displaced people camps that the EUFOR/MINURCAT deployment will bring, our Programme d’Accompagnement à la Stabililisation de l’Est du Tchad will support the conditions in areas to which internally displaced persons and refugees may choose to return in eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic, with particular regard to access to drinking water and food security. Activities will start under this programme before the rainy season commences.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the success of the MINURCAT mission as crucial to safeguarding the long-term stability and development of Chad, as seen in our EUR 10 million contribution to the MINURCAT operation, we are encouraged that training has started for the first 77 commanders of the Détachement intégré de sécurité.</p>
      <p sl="en">To help embed progress, our 10th European Development Fund will include EUR 25 million in support of reform of the justice sector, including the development of the police force, as well as an additional EUR 25 million for Security Sector Reform.</p>

      <p sl="it">The situation in Chad has now become critical. Armed groups from Sudan are carrying out raids in the eastern area of the country with indiscriminate killing, violence and rape, especially among the weaker groups of the population, with no reaction at all from the government there. On the other hand, the evident difficulty of managing the growing number of refugee camps receiving refugees from the Darfur region, threatened by the conflict which has arisen in the country between the government and the opposition forces disputing the validity of the elections, has led the authorities there to declare a national state of emergency.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first result of that measure, as reported by Amnesty International, has been the creation of an ad hoc committee to censor newspapers and radio stations which, as well as bringing about a series of arrests of journalists and political opponents, has led to the disappearance of the spokesman for the party for the defence of the Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="it">This escalation of violence absolutely has to be stopped. The European institutions have the task, the resources and the responsibility to ensure and defend human rights throughout the world, especially in particular regions such as Chad where citizens are already suffering humanitarian crises and attacks from outside.</p>
