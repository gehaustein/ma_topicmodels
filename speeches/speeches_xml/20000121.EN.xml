      <p sl="de">Mr President, I just wanted to raise one question. It says in yesterday’s Minutes that we debated the McNally report and that a vote would be taken on this on 2 February. I should just like to ask why that is necessary. I heard that there was something wrong with the documentation. However, that sort of thing really should not happen. The report was debated, we had time today to vote on it, and I really cannot understand at all why the vote has to take place so long after the debate. The principle of this House is actually that the vote should be taken as soon as possible after the debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I already raised a point about the Minutes yesterday evening. Under item 6 of the Minutes, pages 6 to 7, there is a reference to the motion which I put concerning the inadmissibility of paragraph 6 of the Cunha report. I asked for a roll-call vote and the President in the Chair clearly stated that there would be a roll-call vote on that. Indeed we voted using our voting machines. But I understand that no record has been kept. I should like to have it recorded that there should have been a roll-call vote on that and there ought to have been a nominal list available of the votes for and against that motion.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr� MacCormick, I am aware of this problem. This was due to a technical error as the staff responsible for this task made a mistake which was completely accidental, unforeseeable and unavoidable. Therefore, although the roll-call vote was carried out correctly, the result was not recorded. There is no other reason for this and no way to solve the problem. These things just happen, Mr� MacCormick.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on the same item, item 6 of yesterday's Minutes, the procedural motions on the Cunha report, it says that I moved a referral back to committee under Rule 144, principally because there were doubts as to the admissibility of paragraph 6. That is not correct. Although I referred to the possibility of a motion for inadmissibility which my colleague, Mr MacCormick, may move, the reasons for referral back to committee were that there existed considerable political controversy, as well as practical doubts about the proposal. I therefore sought to have further discussion and consultation with interested parties.</p>

  <section id="creitem2" title="2. Common fisheries policy: closer cooperation between the fishing industry and groups affected">
    <intervention id="5-018" speaker_id="4308" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0094/1999) by Mrs� Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on closer dialogue with the fishing industry and groups affected by the common fisheries policy [COM(99)0382 – C5-0145/99 – 1999/0163(CNS)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-019" speaker_id="4349" name="Miguélez Ramos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Mr� President, the regulation before us today is designed to strengthen the dialogue with the fishing industry and groups affected by the common fisheries policy. The Commission wants to ensure that it duly receives information on the needs of the industry. It also wants to promote the dissemination to this industry of the Community regulations and decisions adopted as part of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Naturally, the Committee on Fisheries supports this proposal for a regulation. In order to make proposals and carry out its responsibilities, the European Commission needs to be informed of the current state of affairs within the industry through dialogue with those involved.</p>
      <p sl="es">This proposal for a regulation has been preceded by the reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, the consultation body created in 1971 and involving all the professional sectors. Briefly, this reform has updated this body by including other parties which have been playing an increasingly prominent part in recent years in the management of the rational exploitation of marine resources, such as non-governmental organisations devoted to development, environmental groups, consumers and also scientists.</p>
      <p sl="es">This reform has also involved a more prominent role being granted to the sectors hitherto underrepresented, such as the aquaculture sector and those engaged in marketing. The number of members of the plenary committee has also been reduced and specialist working groups have been established.</p>
      <p sl="es">The essence of this reform of the Advisory Committee is the priority given to organisations which are most representative at Community level, with the aim of ensuring that the committee is not merely a spokesperson for national interests.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Fisheries of this House, and myself in particular as rapporteur, have been highly critical of the fact that the Commission did not consult us on the reform of this committee. This means that we now have to be content with giving an opinion on this proposal for a regulation which I would venture to qualify as being of minor importance.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to its objectives and mechanisms and the legislative provisions applying to the industry, we fully support the Commission proposal to promote the dissemination of information on the common fisheries policy. We would be delighted if the Commission finally decided to make an effort to improve information. The Commissioner himself, when he last appeared before the committee, acknowledged that this was absolutely essential. Mr� Fischler said that we have a marketing problem and that the information on, and defence of, our model must be improved. This involves both information provided to the fishing industry, which, in many cases, lacks awareness or understanding of its own situation, and information provided by the industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a member of the Committee on Fisheries, I have frequently been surprised by this deep lack of understanding, among the general public, of a common fisheries policy which is of enormous importance to many Member States and to the EU as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the information provided to the fishing industry, we would ask the Commission to take note of the circumstances in which many fishermen are living. Not everyone has access to the new technologies which is why information campaigns must use all the media available to us, including the most traditional. In this respect, I must highlight the work of the written press, which is increasingly concerned about the future of fishing in Europe, and also that of radio and television which are democratic media available to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, I must draw the Commission’s attention to the representative nature of the organisations within the Advisory Committee. Dialogue between the Commission and those involved in the industry is essential. Yet if this dialogue is to be fruitful, those involved must be genuinely representative of the various sectors affected by the common fisheries policy. However, neither the Commission proposal nor the rules governing the Advisory Committee contain mechanisms to ensure that this is the case.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, in such a fragmented industry, which is scattered over wide areas and which has little history of forming associations, it is difficult to ensure that the Commission’s partners in the dialogue at Community level are reliable representatives of the sector concerned. With a view to enhancing their representativeness, it would perhaps be desirable for the Commission to take initiatives to boost the membership of existing trade organisations as an accompanying measure alongside those it is already undertaking. The representatives of the industry chosen as partners for the dialogue with the Commission, namely the members of the Advisory Committee, must represent the common interest.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-020" speaker_id="35" name="Langenhagen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I support a good deal of what Mrs Miguélez Ramos has just so boldly been talking about, since this morning there is a subject on the agenda that will have far-reaching effects upon the future of fisheries policy in Europe: the consolidation of dialogue with the fishing industry regarding the European common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the European Parliament have, for years now, been conducting an intensive dialogue with the fishing industry. We also accompany delegations to Europe’s fishing regions in order to ask the relevant questions on the spot. In that way, we can gain a better insight into the problems of those who have to live and work with the European regulations on a daily basis. This week, I was a guest at the Green Week, the agricultural show in Berlin, where I engaged in a dialogue of this kind with representatives from the German fisheries sector. The subject is extremely topical and highly explosive, especially as we are on the threshold of the reform of the European common fisheries policy in the year 2002.</p>
      <p sl="de">Basically, the policy has to ensure that all interests are properly taken into account and, above all, that the result is the sustainable exploitation of fishing resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">Communication between the fisheries sector and the institutions of the Community must be a two-way process. Industry must articulate its requirements and communicate them to the Commission. On the other hand, the Commission has to prepare and make known the relevant stipulations and decisions. What is being sought is a dialogue, not a monologue. This is something which the Commission has acknowledged, and only by being aware – as, more than anyone else, the people affected are aware – of the problem areas, the difficulties and the possible ways of solving these, will it be possible to make appropriate decisions in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to achieve this goal, the Commission has taken two steps. By means of the proposed regulation in question, the Commission is aiming – quite rightly – to strengthen the European professional associations. Dialogue can, of course, only be carried on if, without compromising their independence, the relevant discussion partners in the fisheries sector are also given financial support to enable them to participate at all in the discussions in Brussels. Approximately EUR 400 000 have this year been set aside for that purpose. The success of the dialogue will, of course, depend entirely upon how clearly the Commission is able, by means of educational initiatives, to explain the complex technical aspects on the spot in the regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore vigorously support the Commission’s present initiative. At the same time, I must, however, point out a major reservation. In fact, this concerns the second step which Mrs Miguélez has also explained to us here. It is about the reform of the important Advisory Committee on Fisheries. This is the basis for the dialogue. Why was the European Parliament not consulted when what was at issue was the form and organisation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the tasks to be carried out by this very important interface and coordinating point for the much sought after dialogue? This is a failure that we shall continue to criticise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Further small reservations I have concern the difficulty of finding genuine representatives of the various sectors of the fisheries industry, given its fragmented structure with its geographical diversity and weak structure in terms of professional associations. Here, it is a question of at last creating practical conditions. However, this also presupposes our perhaps giving some consideration to a new organisational structure for the fisheries sector. Of course, that is always assuming that the fishermen concerned have confidence, on the one hand, in the policy and, on the other hand, in the European common fisheries policy in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore ask of you that we in future make the most strenuous efforts in this regard.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-021" speaker_id="4557" name="Van Hulten" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we had a debate on the Cunha report yesterday. One of the complaints lodged by the Dutch MEPs was that this proposal does not sufficiently take into account the agreements reached in the Netherlands between the government and the fisheries sector to facilitate observance of the fishing quota on a voluntary basis. When there is a possibility to conclude voluntary agreements upon proper consultation between the government and social organisations which have the same effect as legislation, the Dutch Labour Party has a preference for such agreements over unnecessary interference from above. This, of course, also applies at European level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am, therefore, also very pleased with the report of Mrs Miguélez Ramos. Although we had strong differences of opinion regarding the Cunha report, I fully back her proposals to give reinforcement to the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. I congratulate her on her report. I would only make one comment. The Advisory Committee can only function properly if it represents the different sectors involved in the fisheries policy and if all the Union’s fishing nations are represented in the committee. This is not yet the case.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Our Group will therefore vote in favour of Amendment No 3. In this way, it hopes to bring some pressure to bear on this issue. I also call upon the European Commission to ensure that the Advisory Committee is, and continues to be, representative in the sense that I have just described.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Mr President, I can inform you that my Group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, since this resolution makes a major contribution to the European Union’s fisheries policy.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-022" speaker_id="2338" name="Hudghton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, anything which is designed to encourage and foster closer dialogue is to be welcomed and closer dialogue with the fishing and aquaculture industry is something that must be encouraged. But not only the industry; we must widen the dialogue to include associations which are active in the environmental and development fields and allow for an increased role of specialised research bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">A two-way flow of communication must be encouraged, not just one-way communication. My party has always advocated greater consultation with the industry. Indeed, a key advantage of a regionally-based approach to the CFP would be the involvement of those directly affected, the fishermen themselves, in the decisions which affect them, thereby furthering the goal of conserving fish stocks through sustainable fishing and offering long-term viability for the fishing-dependent communities within Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to any reform of the Advisory Committee as part of the current Europe-wide assessment of the CFP, we have another opportunity for Europe to find better ways to involve fishermen in the execution of fisheries responsibilities, by expanding the principle of regionalisation. Involving the industry and other interested parties in the localities would provide a system which more adequately reflects the needs of the fishing industry and promotes, rather than hampers, compliance with the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring that we have proper consultation with civil society too, in particular fisheries and environmental NGOs, will ensure that the Community fisheries policy adequately reflects the aims of conservation and sustainable development in the fisheries sector. But NGO involvement needs to be meaningful, not just token, and we need to work hard to ensure that is the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Integrating those engaged in fishing-related industries into the decision-making processes and supporting the fishermen are prerequisites for the success of any future fisheries policy and an essential element of the CFP. Yesterday, we had some controversy over parts of the Cunha report, particularly the suggestion of quota penalties. If we are to have meaningful consultation then this is exactly the kind of proposal which ought to be consulted upon and I regret that my motion to allow time for that was not successful here.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that we can learn from these mistakes and mean it when we say – as in this report which I support – that we want to improve communication and liaison with fishing industries and those affected by fisheries.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-023" speaker_id="2304" name="Seppänen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Commission has set up a Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture without hearing the other EU institutions. The Commission has mainly chosen as its partners organisations which are represented in the Community. We do not want the Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture to act as a mouthpiece to protect national interests. It does, however, at least from the point of view of Finland and the Baltic Sea. Membership of EUROPÊCHE, which is represented in the Community, is too costly for Finnish fishermen. They cannot become involved in the organisation, as they cannot afford the membership fees. Their interests are therefore not protected in those organisations the Commission has chosen to be its partners. The fishermen cannot afford to be represented in the EU, but the fish breeders can. They are the capitalists of the fishing industry. That casts a strange light on the EU fisheries policy in our country. We just listen to the voice of the fish breeders, the capitalists, but not that of the proletariat, the professionals that catch the fish freely in the open seas, in other words, the fishermen. Besides, we in the Nordic countries also fish in internal waters, which the EU does not take into account.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This representation in supranational organisations is a problematic issue, as the EU does not focus sufficient attention on it. The supranational organisation, EUROPÊCHE, is ineffectual. It is unrepresentative, and its decisions are not binding on member organisations, but it is the size of Member States and money that decide issues, and what are called supranational interests are, in fact, national interests. It is the Commission’s important task to apply this regulation in such a way that the organisations that are represented in the Community acquire a better level of representation, and that the voice of those fishermen who cannot afford to join EU-level organisations that might represent their interests is heard.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-024" speaker_id="2217" name="Berthu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group can do no other than express their agreement with the intentions of a proposal for a regulation which aims at strengthening dialogue with workers in the fishing sector. We must say, however, at the same time, that some of the methods used to organise this dialogue have confused us considerably.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, the necessary strengthening of dialogue. The common fisheries policy is applicable to all European Union operators, but it must deal with a wide range of situations, with variations in fishing grounds, the home ports of vessels, traditions, the gear used, organisation of the market at local level, etc. This is true to such an extent, indeed, that some thinkers have wondered whether well-coordinated national policies would not be preferable to a single common policy. Whatever the case, since today there is just one policy in force and the situations of fishing sector workers are so varied, it is all the more important to establish very close liaison with them in order to better take their needs into consideration and to overcome the harmful effects of some regulations, or even avoid the failure, pure and simple, to implement this regulation, a phenomenon occasionally observed, unfortunately, due to the regulation’s total lack of regard for real conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why the members of our Group will be voting in favour of the three amendments tabled today, whose purpose is to improve the operation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, to bring it closer to the workers of the sector and to the requirements of national states, and finally to request that the Commission presents an annual report to Council and to the European Parliament on the debates of that body. The fact is that all the Community institutions, not just the Commission, have an interest in this debate in order to be able to contribute to orientation of the common fisheries policy in line, naturally, with the interests of our fishing fleets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the same, we find some aspects of the reform extremely disturbing, as the Commission is introducing a wide range of pressure groups into the Advisory Committee, generally groups with connections in Brussels, which are dedicated to extremely noble causes – development, environment, consumer issues, etc. And at the same time, alongside the fishermen, using Community financing, the Commission would like to increase the importance of European professional bodies which, for the time being, exist only on paper. It looks as if the Commission is seeking to import masses of miscellaneous participants to provide a counterbalance to the national bodies which are themselves properly structured, well established and truly representative. It is as if the Commission were trying to get out of a discussion with some negotiators that are hard to handle and to create a completely new conciliation structure that would be more kindly disposed towards the Commission, and which would reflect its own pleasant image of itself and its plans, and that is exactly what it expects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On an even more worrying note, in the end one wonders how many other sectors have already been organised in this way and whether a vast network of associations or organisations with no truly representative nature, financed chiefly by Community subsidies and participating in largely artificial consultation, has not already been constructed in Brussels. The case we are examining today leads us to think that this hypothesis may well be the correct one. In such conditions, the Brussels institutions should not be surprised to find themselves losing touch with public opinion. Member States would do well to take this matter seriously if they do not shortly wish to see the national democracies they represent ousted by insubstantial pressure groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the sector which is of immediate concern to us, the fisheries sector, we consider it absolutely essential to ensure that the various members of the Advisory Committee are truly representative. All the Member States involved in fishing activities must be represented, as must the workers involved in those activities. These are the parties we should be relying on, not artificial organisations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-025" speaker_id="2318" name="Van Dam" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is to be welcomed that the Commission is taking initiatives to foster closer dialogue with the fisheries organisations. It is important that the Commission knows what is happening at grassroots level. We do not need a Commission which imposes rules from its ivory tower. Consultation with the sectors is necessary to avoid issuing rules which cannot be implemented in practice. A dialogue is also necessary in order to gain a clear insight into the different interests, so that balanced decisions can be taken.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With the present draft regulation, the Commission aims to give reinforcement to the European trade organisations. There is certainly something to be said for that. It is in the interest of both the fisheries sector and the Commission to have one European umbrella organisation in place. As regards the fisheries sector, it is an important platform for heightening the Commission’s awareness of common interests and the Commission will have a better idea where it is at if the sector uses one and the same mouthpiece.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the fisheries sector is pre-eminently a sector with tremendous national contrasts. Talk to any ordinary fisherperson and you will find out that, in their experience, there are no European fishing people. The European fleet consists of fishing people who are Belgian, Danish, Dutch, etc. and, to a large extent, they are each other’s competitors. The average fisherperson, therefore, has more confidence in his/her national interest group than in a European one where the office mainly consists of representatives from other Member States. We should not lose sight of this reality.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Consequently, we should not see a European organisation as a replacement but rather an addition to national organisations. The European Commission should keep the lines of communication open with these national organisations as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This brings me to the amendment which my Group has submitted concerning the Advisory Committee. Admittedly, the Commission has not asked us for an opinion regarding the composition of this committee, but the Commission will hopefully excuse me for giving it an unprompted opinion nevertheless.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On 16 July 1999, the Commission and industry agreed on a compromise regarding the new Advisory Committee. They came to the agreement that all EU Member States, insofar as they are fishing nations, should be represented in this committee. Conflicts of interest, as already stated, make it impossible for various members of the trade organisations to give their mandate to someone of a different nationality.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee has convened in its new form. Unfortunately, however, I have to note that little is left of the agreed balance. In the committee, some nationalities are heavily over-represented, whilst a number of other Member States are conspicuous by their absence. To the former chairman of the Advisory Committee, under whose directorship the compromise came about, this was even reason to refuse to chair the first meeting of the committee.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Commission might well argue that representativeness is more than just fair distribution across the Member States. This is true of course. There should also be a fair distribution across the sectors. What I would like to ascertain from the Commission, however, is the following: “Why did you fail to act upon the compromise of 16 July which clearly states that there should also be a balanced distribution in terms of nationalities?”</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to address the Commission with an urgent recommendation. Do reconsider the composition of the new Advisory Committee. If you want to establish a proper dialogue with the sectors involved, if you attach importance to creating a basis for your policy, make sure there is a representative consultative body.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-026" speaker_id="1993" name="Fraga Estévez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr� President, like my fellow MEPs and the Miguélez Ramos report, I must highlight the Commission’s arbitrary working methods. It is absurd that the Commission did not consult Parliament or the Council on reforming the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and yet it is consulting us on this proposal for a regulation to strengthen the dialogue between the Commission and the fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means that the Commission did not consult us on the primary regulations but is doing so on the accompanying aspects. It did not consult us on the regulations establishing the dialogue but is doing so on how to strengthen this dialogue now it has been established. Yet the Commission’s reforms of such an important body as the Advisory Committee, which is the only body to involve the fishing industry in decisions affecting it, have prompted serious criticisms and doubts in Parliament, in the Council and in the industry itself. These criticisms involve the fact that a large part of the industry actually involved in fishing is not sufficiently represented on this new committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said this, in short, the financial resources in the proposal are welcome.</p>
      <p sl="es">It only remains for me to congratulate Mrs� Miguélez Ramos on her report and, in particular, to defend the amendment which imposes the obligation to present Parliament with an annual report on the substance and conclusions of the debates of the working groups created by this regulation. I must also applaud the request contained in the opinion by Mr� Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for detailed reports on the distribution of funds among the various Member States and organisations which may benefit by this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be brief. I support this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her work. The Socialist Group welcomes the Commission reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries to create a more fruitful two-way dialogue between the Commission and the industry. We welcome the inclusion in the Advisory Committee of new sectors of the industry and the greater diversity of professional sectors involved, particularly those in aquaculture and marketing.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the reduction in the number of members in the Plenary Committee in the interest of greater efficiency. We all know the danger of proliferating numbers at the expense of efficiency. The Commission seems to have taken that into account. We welcome the increased role of the research organisations and the establishment of the four working groups on: firstly, access to fisheries resources and their management; secondly, aquaculture, fish, molluscs and shellfish; thirdly, marketing and trade policy; fourthly, economic and structural sectoral analysis.</p>
      <p sl="en">We like the priority for Community-level organisations to try and avoid nationalising the debate, but we recognise that there need to be some national inputs at the appropriate levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will give this report our support, while promising to maintain a close watch to ensure that the structural changes that promise much actually deliver in practice; and that the new Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture acts as an effective sounding board for all sectors and all sides of the industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unusually perhaps, I speak on this motion as a Member who is not a member of the Fisheries Committee. On the other hand, I represent – on the west of Scotland particularly – a very large number of fisherpersons and their families and fragile communities whose existence is dependent upon the continuation of a successful fishing industry in the European Community and upon a proper sensitivity of the Community to those fragile and often remote regions of the Community which depend most upon it.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very laudable thing to say that the Advisory Committee on Fisheries should not simply be a gathering place for national interests, especially if national interests are interpreted exclusively in terms of the interests of the Member States, taken according to the principles of proportional equality in which the Member States are represented in the organs of the Community.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another kind of equality which would be proportional to the effort engaged in the industry and indeed, proportional to the amount of sea waters and seaboard that different regions of this great Community bring into it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask Members to carry out a little experiment. Imagine expelling Scotland from the Community. How much fishing industry would you have left? Now contemplate this question: how effectively is the voice of the Scottish fishing industry represented in the institutions of the Community, as we have them just now? The answer is: not very effectively at all! Therefore, it would indeed be a good thing if this report were to achieve a much more satisfactory representation of the fishing people, of the environmental interest and of the other civil society interests.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr� President, Commissioner, I must firstly congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs� Miguélez Ramos, on her excellent report. The strengthening of dialogue between the Commission and the industry affected by the common fisheries policy is very important and has many social repercussions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Like the rapporteur, I must underline how curious it is that the Commission is consulting Parliament on aspects which we might regard as being secondary in the organisation of this dialogue. Yet it did not ask this House about the composition, organisation and functions of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries which is the key body in this dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the direct and democratic representative of the people, the European Parliament should have been consulted on this body and on the representativeness of the various sectors involved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said this, we will have to wait for the new committee to start work in order to assess its activity. This is why I regard as positive the contributions made by the Miguélez Ramos report on the aspects of financial control of the costs and greater transparency in management. In this way, the maximum amount of information will be provided, both to Parliament and the Council, so that the strengthening of the dialogue intended by the Commission can be monitored by everyone.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the Commission will take note of our comments and concerns as we will be watching the development and operation of the new committee very closely. We hope that the links between the Committee on Fisheries of this House and the Advisory Committee will be effective in order to encourage a real strengthening of the social and industrial dialogue on fishing.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as a Christian Democrat, I would like to evaluate the Commission’s proposal on two counts. First of all, the principle of subsidiarity is observed, the countries are sufficiently involved, and secondly, sufficient consideration is given to organisations or the social mainstream. In this sense, I am pleased that a reinforced Advisory Committee is to be set up which can possibly exert more influence on the fisheries policy. So far, so good.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am less impressed, however, with the actual implementation. I have to note that the proposal is lacking in two areas at least. To start with, not all Member States are represented, which is very poor indeed. After all, this Parliament also believes in the subsidiarity of Member States. This means that Member States with a major fisheries sector cannot be left out.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, if the social mainstream and organisations are to be involved in the fisheries policy, this should be done in a balanced and proper way, recognising just how important geographic distribution is. On this score, the proposal is simply inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is for this reason that, together with other Members, Mr Van Dam, among others, I would still ask that an Advisory Committee be set up which has an important role to play, but which must represent the entire sector Europe-wide. In practical terms, this means that all fishing nations of the Union have to be represented in the committee.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the former Advisory Committee, agreement was reached on this between the sector and the Commission. In my view, also from a Christian Democratic viewpoint, the fact that this was overlooked in the present proposals submitted by the trade organisations is most unacceptable.</p>

    <intervention id="5-031" speaker_id="2156" name="Cunha" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on her work, especially on the even-handed analysis she makes in this report and on having hit the nail on the head. Perhaps I should say the nails, as there are two fundamental issues here, which various speakers have already commented on and which this Parliament cannot fail to note.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first is that we are surprised, or rather amazed, that Parliament should now be heard on procedural aspects of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, when it was not heard at the time the Council’s membership was discussed. Last year, as we all know, the Commission approved, on its own initiative, Decision 478/99, which created this Advisory Committee. It did not listen to Parliament on a subject as important as the representativeness of fishing organisations and their importance to formulating and managing the common policy. I find it incomprehensible that Parliament should not have been heard. It is a real mystery. Sometimes people’s reasons defy reason itself. I do not know if there is some reason of which I am not aware for Parliament not being heard.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My second observation is that we have many doubts as to how representative these bodies actually are. For example, a country such as my own, Portugal, which is a large fishing nation in European Union terms, the fifth-largest in terms of the size of its fleet, is not appropriately represented here. I am astonished. I find it a total mystery.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To conclude the second issue, or to hit the second nail on the head, and bearing in mind these shortcomings in the Advisory Committee and in its representativeness, it is crucial that financial aid for other organisations which are not part of the Advisory Committee be earmarked and set aside.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-032" speaker_id="1436" name="McCartin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this report and thank Mrs Ramos for her introduction which was comprehensive and constructive. It is useful to make this effort to promote better dialogue between the European Union and those involved in fisheries. In the part of the European Union I come from, a peripheral region, we have always had particular difficulty in selling the idea of a common fisheries policy to fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Mr MacCormick has brought up the subject – and I have referred to it before – the position is difficult for Ireland because if you took Ireland out of the European Union, you would take a lot of fish with you. Traditionally, Irish fishermen did not catch those fish, because as some people will know, there was a period in our history when it was forbidden by law to put fish into Irish vessels. That situation largely continued until the beginning of this century, and so people were still fishing in outdated curraghs 20 years before we joined the European Union. In any case, it is a fact of life that something like EUR 700 million worth of fish – and perhaps even more because the price of fish has changed – comes out of Irish waters. As a result of the reduction in the structural funds allocated to Ireland, because of its economic growth, the value of fish taken out of what would be Irish waters if there was no European Union will be greater in a couple of years time than the total amount of structural funds coming to Ireland. That makes this proposal even more difficult to sell.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not aware that the same is true in any other country of the European Union. Scotland, as part of the United Kingdom, takes its natural share along with the United Kingdom, but Ireland is the one country which does not. This is the only natural resource which I know all Member States concede as common property of the European Union. That does not mean that we do not need to proceed with this dialogue. The extension of the 20-mile limit, which Parliament has agreed to, might be part of the solution and might help to satisfy local fishermen, giving them more control over their lives. I do not want renationalisation, but regionalisation would certainly help the problems of Scotland and Ireland.</p>

    <intervention id="5-033" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diamantopoulou" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the frequent legislative changes in the area of the common fisheries policy illustrate the fact that things are really happening in this sector. This is something which was not quite so readily reflected in the way the previous Advisory Committee on Fisheries operated and so this legislative proposal has been drafted. The purpose of this proposal is to create a more effective and genuine relationship between the Commission and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="el">It took the Commission three years to draft this proposal. In 1997, a survey was carried out by an independent office, from which two main ideas emerged. The first was that the common fisheries policy now extends beyond the fishing industry and concerns the whole of society. This is something we must take into account. The second was that the Advisory Committee’s mode of operation did not meet the requirements for handling complex issues.</p>
      <p sl="el">The legislative proposal therefore falls into three categories. The first is the reform of the Advisory Committee, which now consists of 20 members instead of 45, with participation from fisheries organisations making up 60%, industrial and commercial enterprises within the sector 25%, and environmental organisations 15%. The Commission has thus endeavoured to consult not only professionals and entrepreneurs, but also society as a whole. The second part of the legislative proposal concerns measures to aid the representative organisations of those involved with the common fisheries policy and, in particular, European professional fishing organisations. The third part concerns improving communication between the DG for Fisheries and these groups.</p>
      <p sl="el">The legislative proposal touches upon the latter two points, but I would like to reiterate that there were lengthy deliberations over the final proposal as regards the actual composition of the committee. On 26 October, the Council examined this proposal for the first time and is now awaiting the opinion of Parliament so that it can get on with its work.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to commend Mrs Ramos in particular on the exceptional quality of her report, as well as Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries for its excellent cooperation and contribution to this text.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to comment on the amendments and to express the Commission’s view on the matter. Three amendments have been tabled by the parliamentary committee. The first concerns Parliament’s desire to exercise tight control over payments to professional organisations so that they closely correspond to the purposes set out in the legislative proposal. The Commission agrees and accepts this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the second amendment, the Commission obviously agrees with Parliament’s view as regards access to information concerning the work of the committee and the numerous debates it holds. However, drawing up an annual report of all this activity would be an extremely arduous task for the already overburdened directorate for community fishing and would not necessarily lend any added value.</p>
      <p sl="el">The third amendment encompasses the second and refers to the representativeness of the Advisory Committee, that is the participation of all nationalities. We agree that, within the Committee, the whole sector must be safeguarded and represented on an equal basis, but we are uncertain as to the extent to which – and this is something which came up both in the survey and in discussions – this balance should be based on nationality. The Commission proposed to assist European organisations, which are entirely free to regulate national representation or representation of certain groups wherever they see fit.</p>
      <p sl="el">In closing, I would like to say that the Commission adopts Amendment No 1 which calls on the Community to tighten its financial control, but it considers it advisable, for the aforementioned reasons, to reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3.</p>

I am telling you this to explain why I am interested in fishing and why I voted for this measure.

Perhaps Parliament failed to do so because it was tamely bowing to opposition expressed during the debate by Commissioner Diamantopoulou. This result is incomprehensible, given that, in the same debate, there was widespread criticism of the Commission for not having consulted Parliament when membership of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries was being reformed. Amendment No 3 was the only one which covered this issue, and it had the vital aim of guaranteeing that this advisory structure is genuinely representative and that it moves beyond its unbalanced and largely notional character. It is unfortunate that even in a matter as simple as this, the common fisheries policy is still poorly served.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">B5-0006/2000 by Mrs� Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission, on the protection of volunteer and humanitarian workers abroad;</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-043" speaker_id="2005" name="Sauquillo Pérez del Arco" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr� President, I do not want to over-dramatise the situation as there are many civilians suffering violence in armed conflicts around the world. However, between 1992 and 1997, 131 volunteer and humanitarian workers and human rights activists working for the United Nations in areas of conflict were murdered.</p>
      <p sl="es">Between 1� January 1994 and 17� March 1997, 119 volunteer and humanitarian workers were kidnapped in 35 separate incidents. In 1992, one United Nations representative died violently every month. In 1993, one died every two weeks and, in 1994, one died every week.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the first two months of 1997, 9 volunteers died. In 1996, 153 delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross were subject to security incidents, including murders and kidnappings. I must, in particular, mention the deaths of three members of Médecins du Monde-Spain in Rwanda in 1997.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, as stated by the joint motion for a resolution with which we want to close this debate, the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz and Jorge Luis Mazo are simply the latest in a long line of attacks. These two men were volunteers for the organisation Paz y Tercer Mundo. They were murdered on 18� November in Quibdó on the Atrato river, 500 kilometres north of Bogotá, Colombia. These attacks strike not only at the integrity of these individuals but also at human rights, international humanitarian law and, within this, the right of victims of conflicts to be helped, to see the perpetrators of these acts tried and to receive the necessary reparation so that these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="es">The recent insecurity for humanitarian workers is due to the increase in conflicts, the exponential growth of humanitarian organisations and, in particular, the nature of current conflicts. These are no longer between regular armed forces, subject to political control, and guerrilla movements with a defined command structure and ideologies. Conflicts in which the warring parties are responsible, to some extent, for the protection of humanitarian workers, from whose actions the people benefit, no longer exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">Volunteer and humanitarian workers are now exposed to banditry. The civilian population is regarded as just another element in the conflict and as part of the political and military strategy. Humanitarian action has therefore become an obstacle to the warring parties in the achievement of their objectives which often involve the elimination of part of the civilian population for ethnic, religious or cultural reasons.</p>
      <p sl="es">In view of this situation, the security of humanitarian workers is a widespread problem which is of concern to Parliament. The Commission should be concerned as it finances over 180 NGOs working in areas of conflict. The Council should also be concerned as it is engaged in advancing an external policy in accordance with the Treaties, in promoting human rights and a security policy which, at the moment, is specifically confined to humanitarian actions.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why we ask for Parliament’s concerns to be echoed by the other institutions. The Commission should act by preparing a communication on the security conditions of volunteer and humanitarian workers and by adopting measures which guarantee this security. Before applying the measures proposed by some governments, such as military protection of their volunteers, we must examine other measures which may be more effective in situations of conflict. The Council should act through the promotion, from within the CFSP, of international humanitarian law and perhaps through the creation of a European civilian peace corps.</p>
      <p sl="es">In 1999, we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on International Humanitarian Law, which protect the civilian population in armed conflicts, and which guarantee their access to international aid. These are instruments which impose a legal obligation on countries but which are systematically being breached.</p>
      <p sl="es">We ask the Secretary-General of the Council to use the European Union’s incipient capacity for external action to promote these EU principles. The Secretary-General of the United Nations recently asked the Security Council to impose international humanitarian law, even by applying Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here today, we simply ask that we start to acquire a conscience and that measures are taken to tackle a problem which affects not only the NGOs but also the very foundations of our concept of world order.</p>

    <intervention id="5-044" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diamantopoulou" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="el">The Commission deeply regrets this tragic event. This is one of those events happening all over the world on a daily basis to which Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco referred. In addition, the Commission would like, once again, to point to the courage and dedication of the humanitarian aid workers who are working in such dangerous regions all over the world.</p>
      <p sl="el">In Colombia’s case in particular, the Commission has let its concerns on the matter be known to the Colombian authorities on numerous occasions. We are continuing to monitor the situation and are in constant cooperation with the Member State embassies in Bogota. As for the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz, who was working on ECHO’s plans, and the priest, the Commission and the Member States have put pressure on the Colombian authorities to hold an inquiry. The European Commission and the Spanish ambassador met with the Colombian Deputy Prime Minister, insisting that those responsible for the crime be brought to justice. Saving and safeguarding lives in these extraordinary cases constitute an integral part of humanitarian legislation.</p>
      <p sl="el">ECHO’s role in Colombia and in other countries is to monitor the humanitarian situation in the country and, in Colombia’s case in particular, to monitor the situation of persons who are being displaced against their will. There are also continuous efforts to monitor the implementation of humanitarian laws. Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco emphasised the need for specific measures and action on the part of the Commission to ensure the safety of those aid workers. You referred to the existing Commission document from May 1998 on the security of aid workers, which sets out priorities and specific action to be taken. On account of the fact that the situation had worsened, the Commission’s ECHO office, together with the International Red Cross organisation, organised a seminar in Bogota on the question of security in April 1999, where all the organisations in Colombia were asked to have a Security Charter and to inform the Red Cross in advance of their movements. This was to ensure that those carrying arms were informed as to the humanitarian nature of any particular mission.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would also point out that, in addition to careful planning, action measures and training for aid workers, there is still a need for funding. Applying humanitarian aid is by no means a costless operation. For this reason, the Commission is not only urging that this humanitarian aid be put into practice but it is also funding activities to train those who take part in these missions and to increase their awareness of the dangers involved. Allow me, if I may, to mention some recent and previous examples of initiatives which have been undertaken for this purpose: they include the presentation of documents on humanitarian aid, the seminar on security between the partners in Lisbon, the workshop on security issues for staff in Brussels, the inclusion of staff security issues in ECHO’s guidelines and a conference of ECHO correspondents to be held in February-March 2000 on that matter.</p>
      <p sl="el">Naturally, the European Parliament proposals will be taken into account, and because this is a matter which presents particular difficulties and has so many different aspects, close cooperation and innovative ideas and proposals are very important for Commission action.</p>

    <intervention id="5-045" speaker_id="4326" name="Gutiérrez Cortines" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr� President, the murder of a volunteer worker, Iñigo Eguiluz, and a Colombian priest, Jorge Luis Mazo, on the Atrato river in Colombia is a tragedy. We can only add this to the list of violent deaths suffered in recent years by volunteers who have dedicated their lives to the achievement of peace and who have also brought education to the most disadvantaged people.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore logical that this Group and this House should be speaking out and sending a message of understanding and condolence to the families of these victims and of support and courage to their companions who are continuing to work in these places. At the same time, we call on the institutions responsible for ensuring justice, the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Colombian Government, to make every effort to ensure that justice prevails and that these events are punished in accordance with the law.</p>
      <p sl="es">The imprisonment of a suspect is a positive sign which we congratulate. We also welcome the willingness shown by the Colombian President, Mr� Pastrana, on his recent visit to this House. However, while understanding the complexity of the problem, we would remind the Colombian Government that support for the Red Cross and the United Nations Commission for Refugees is a measure which will always receive our backing, as will efforts to rigorously apply the rules laid down in 1998 and other previous rules establishing the real, legal protection of these groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also recognise that the systems of detection and legal protection of volunteer workers need to be improved. These volunteers necessarily work in areas of conflict, in places characterised by violence and poverty and in areas of darkness, into which the gaze of justice cannot penetrate. We therefore need to find other measures and devise new systems. Precisely for this reason, we who live in prosperity, together with the European institutions and governments, are obliged by a code of honour to establish a range of protection measures for humanitarian workers, with full support for justice. For while we try to help from the outside, these volunteers are building peace and solidarity from within. They are the ones entering shadowy places to bring healthcare and solve problems. They are the most noble side of a self-indulgent society, which is why our response must be effective and responsible.</p>

    <intervention id="5-046" speaker_id="1337" name="Medina Ortega" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr� President, the statements by Commissioner Diamantopoulou reassure us as they demonstrate that the Commission is aware of the problems caused by the lack of security for volunteer workers in certain countries. Mrs� Sauquillo has highlighted, in both her oral question and her intervention, that this problem is not specific to one country. While Colombia is certainly one of the countries whose situation does not allow the security of volunteers to be guaranteed, this is also true of many other countries in Africa, Asia and other places.</p>
      <p sl="es">The motion for a resolution asks the Commission to draw up a communication in this respect. I am not sure if this is the most appropriate instrument but it seems that the Commission is ready to work in this direction. It would probably be useful to look at preparing a document.</p>
      <p sl="es">The aspect which does not make much sense to me is the singling out of Colombia and the support for some of the amendments tabled which are aimed, for example, at suspending cooperation. The suspension of cooperation with these countries causes great harm to their people. We must not curtail this cooperation when this is unselfishly provided by people who know the risks to which they are exposed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, to suggest that we might stop governmental participation in the channelling of aid is to ignore the real situation. I have visited many areas of Colombia and, apart from the natural factors – it is difficult terrain – there is the added problem of the existence of several movements of different types. We never know which one may end someone’s life. Without a minimum amount of governmental aid, cooperation would be absolutely impossible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that this debate is very useful as a reminder to the Commission of what is happening. To a certain extent, the Commission has reassured us by indicating that this is an issue of concern to it but we must look at the situation calmly. International cooperation must continue. This European Community has to continue setting an example in international cooperation. We have to support our volunteers and it would therefore be desirable for the Community institutions, the governments of the Member States and the governments of the recipient countries to guarantee the security of these workers. This protection could be provided firstly through prevention and secondly through legal action. The Colombian authorities assure me that they have already initiated legal proceedings based on the detention of one person. Colombia is a country in which the judiciary enjoys great independence and the executive does not have the power to judge criminals. The standard legal channels must therefore be followed.</p>
      <p sl="es">So, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I encourage you to follow the course which has been set. In this way we hope that the security of our volunteer workers can be improved.</p>

      <p sl="en">As Parliamentarians we are often guilty of complaining about the privations of our life, travelling between two, three or four cities, occupying cramped offices and so forth. So it is a humbling moment to rise in this House to speak on this topic and contemplate the problems and dangers faced by brave people who go out as humanitarian workers in Third World countries. We can only pause and reflect upon the conditions of their lives and sometimes, alas, of their deaths. That said, my Group and I are disappointed that our colleagues in the Socialist Party – although rightly saying that this is a general problem – seem to be losing sight – in our opinion – of the need to concentrate on Columbia.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to recall that President Pastrana visited this place as recently as October and gave assurances about safeguarding human rights and about the prosecution of crime and the dismantling of the paramilitary forces. These assurances have turned out to be almost worthless. Not enough has been done. The motion on behalf of my Group says that the Commission should insist, as a condition of its presence and its work in the country, on the enforcement of laws relating to the protection of displaced workers and on the provision of guarantees from the Colombian Government relating to their physical safety and material wellbeing. It is right that the Commission should insist on these requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the next clause the motion says that we oppose the continuing of aid to the Colombian Government, but not to the Colombian people because the next clause says that we should continue aid through other channels and direct it to make sure that the paramilitary forces are discountenanced and that civil order returns as fast as reasonably possible to Columbia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights workers are a critical part of the problem, but not the whole problem. The only way to stop the killing will be by dismantling the paramilitary troops and providing adequate bodyguards for human rights workers. ECHO and the Commission have to put pressure on the governments to do this.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, on 26 October of last year, Colombia’s President, Mr Pastrana, spoke here in the European Parliament. He maintained that he wanted to work for human rights in his country and for a situation in which activists involved in issues affecting human rights are offered protection and in which those responsible for murders and crimes of violence, which are mainly committed by paramilitary groups, are not granted immunity from prosecution but are held responsible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Less than a month later, the murders that form the backdrop to today’s debate took place. A paramilitary group attacked the organisation Peace and the Third World, an organisation which, with the support of the ECHO programme, works to provide humanitarian aid to farmers driven off their land. A Colombian priest and a Spanish aid worker were killed. The latter worked for the peace brigades whose presence is supposed to protect human rights activists against violence. These murders are just a few in the long list of excesses in Colombia, but this time a citizen of an EU country was also killed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Murders and disappearances are part of everyday life in Colombia. Just recently, for example, two prominent spokespersons for the peasants’ movement disappeared. They had been carried off by a paramilitary group and they have not been found.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Behind the greater part of this terror are paramilitary groups with more or less obvious links to the country’s own military and power structures. It has been repeatedly demonstrated how the country’s military has been directly implicated in various acts of violence. The victims are the civilian population in areas where the guerrillas have support, the political Left, union activists and those who work for human rights. The legal Left in the country has been hit hard. Thousands of its representatives, including mayors and parliamentarians, have quite simply been murdered. Very seldom have the perpetrators been punished.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In a country like that, it is not surprising that many people turn to the guerrilla movement and the armed struggle. It should be emphasised, however, that the guerrillas too are responsible for acts of violence which it is impossible to defend. Achieving better respect for human rights in Colombia is absolutely crucial if a peaceful solution to the country’s civil war is going to be possible. The peace efforts must be supported, at the same time as the Colombian government must be put under constant pressure, especially from the European Union, when it comes to the issue of human rights. Foreign, that is to say American, military involvement must be rejected.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has not been able to subscribe to the compromise resolution which has been negotiated. We think it is quite inadequate in its criticism of the Colombian government. It is striking that paragraph D of the resolution refers to the occupation of a Red Cross office by farmers, while the thousands of political murders which have taken place in Colombia are not discussed in any clear way.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens. In the first amendment, we want aid to the Colombian government to be made dependent upon respect for human rights, and those who work with these questions to be protected.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the second amendment, we want to increase humanitarian aid through organisations which are independent of the Colombian government, for example the various civilian peace corps. If these amendments are adopted, the present resolution will be somewhat better and clearer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the founding of the Red Cross after the battle of Solferino was a response to an, until then, unknown dimension of cruelty, modern, total warfare, which was such a decisive feature of the twentieth century. At the beginning of the 21st century, we are experiencing, however, an ever greater proliferation of new forms of war in the shape of ethnic conflicts. Militias clash, or the opposing sides in civil wars or simply criminal gangs. Governments are either implicated in the conflicts or else they are completely, or largely, powerless to resolve them. Naturally, this also greatly jeopardises humanitarian and development aid. It is therefore our task as the European Parliament to focus very strongly upon this issue. We may well admire the contributions which people are making here in the fields of humanitarian and development aid, but we must also ensure that their living and working conditions improve.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we have quite a lot of catching up to do in this regard. We must see to it that the European Union in actual fact provides aid in every place where, for example, NGOs are doing so in an exemplary way. It is not only in South America that we have this set of problems. This week, we had the debate about Chechnya and, some time ago, the debate about Central Asia. Then, Mr Madelin addressed us on the subject of Afghanistan. And, again and again, we observe the same phenomenon: the withdrawal of humanitarian aid because safety is not being guaranteed. A number of NGOs demonstrate to us how, in spite of this, aid can be supplied, albeit under very perilous conditions. However, the European Union as well as other large organisations, such as the Red Cross, are all too often on the retreat.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must be careful that this trend does not continue, for it is shamelessly exploited by some governments which then say that aid may only be provided to themselves and not directly, through the NGOs, at the coalface. That is dangerous because these governments are in fact not the solution to the problem but a part of it, and even the cause. We must therefore remain very firmly in control of the situation. For this reason, we are beginning, as a Parliament, to be very disappointed in our Commissioner responsible for this area, Mr Nielson.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask you, Commissioner, to also convey this to Mr Nielson. For some weeks, dissatisfaction has been growing in this House. We had criticisms to make of Mrs Bonino in the administrative area, but Mrs Bonino was present. She was not only present in Parliament but had also visited the regions in crisis. The European Union had a human face where humanitarian and development aid were concerned. The Commission has a considerable amount of catching up to do in this area. We are slowly beginning here – I can detect this in all Groups – to develop a very critical attitude. I believe that we ought to move early to a situation in which we are again developing joint initiatives in this area for the purpose of stabilising the political sphere and supporting NGOs, but also of making the European Union’s presence felt, where necessary, at the coalface.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it is extremely important to have a dialogue on such difficult issues as humanitarian aid, the administration of humanitarian aid and the safety of aid workers all over the world. The role of the European Parliament is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I rise to speak as I would like to refer to the comments made about Commissioner Nielson. Firstly, he is not present today as he is on a trip to South Africa. Secondly, over the past three months he has become involved in many crises. And thirdly, he has worked hard and has already submitted plans to the Commission for total restructuring and for new regulations on administering humanitarian aid as well as for innovative ways of cooperating with non-governmental organisations. I understand and I empathise with many of the comments of the honourable Members on the problems that exist, but I think it is a bit much to criticise a Commissioner who has only been in office for three months and who has already carried out some important work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I abstained from voting because I consider it necessary for the Commission to continue to cultivate intensive contacts with the government but also to endeavour to cooperate in a more focused way with the non-governmental organisations. I believe that media policy too is very important and that it is very important that we should also clarify to the population at the coalface what is actually happening. It should also be our policy to bring together both parties to the conflict. The Commission has already done a very great deal in this area and, in this connection, I wish it every success in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted for this motion on the protection of volunteer aid workers throughout the world because I believe that one of the European Community’s major obligations is to defend its volunteer workers, who are carrying out such important work all over the globe. The European Union must regulate this sector. I hope that the Commission will bear in mind that, in its commercial dealings with all the states, it should also ask for assistance and protection for volunteer workers and take action to ensure that those who go to help other citizens in different parts of the world are prepared, educated and protected, and allowed to carry out their work.</p>
