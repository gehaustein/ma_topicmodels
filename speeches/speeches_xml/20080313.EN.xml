      <p sl="en">Mr President, yesterday afternoon, in an unscheduled announcement in this Chamber, the President made a show of imposing financial sanctions on a number of Members because of the protest in December. What I want to know is: was it in order for the President to make that announcement without doing those Members the basic courtesy of telling them that such an announcement would be made and when it would be made? The President talked much about showing courtesy to Members in this House, so why, I ask, were those of us affected by his announcement not done the basic courtesy of being told that he would make such an announcement? Is it too much to expect an answer to that?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, with reference among others to Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, you just said that it is your duty to apply the Rules. I cannot understand why sittings keep starting late, sometimes by several minutes or even a quarter of an hour. That wastes a lot of taxpayers’ money. You are very strict about observing the Rules vis à vis political opponents, who simply want a referendum or fairness and democracy, but not when it comes to yourself!</p>
      <p sl="de">If you treated everybody equally in this House, then you would long since have had to initiate proceedings against the Presidency for countless incidents of serious fraud, because that is precisely what I would call it when sittings keep starting late, with the resulting waste of taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two different yardsticks are being applied here and you must accept the reproach that this is a Parliament that acts arbitrarily, that deliberately sidelines political opponents on the grounds of technicalities while constantly tolerating what happens on its own side and even covering up serious fraud!</p>

    <intervention id="4-010" speaker_id="4308" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Danutė Budreikaitė, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the Challenge of EU Development Cooperation Policy for the New Member States (2007/2140(INI)) (A6-0036/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="28268" name="Danutė Budreikaitė" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="lt">Since the enlargement rounds of 2004 and 2007, the European Union has seen the accession of 12 countries, 10 of which have special experience. They have moved from a planned economy to a market economy and from authoritarian control to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Prior to accession, these countries were recipients of aid, but now they have become donors of development cooperation aid. Most of them had no previous experience of pursuing EU cooperation policy. By signing the Treaty of Accession they have committed themselves to implementing this policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Moreover, in 2004 the Commission produced several documents emphasising the European Neighbourhood Policy that were directly connected with the new Member States’ official development assistance. After three years of membership it is important to examine the progress of the new donor countries in meeting the challenges of development cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to point out that the report covers only the 10 Member States that share land borders with Eastern neighbours and benefit from the Neighbourhood Policy. These 10 countries have always had long-term trade, economic and cultural relations with their neighbours and shared a common history as well as the aspiration to achieve the objectives of development and consolidation of democracy and to increase security in Eastern and Central Europe. The results of a special study show that most of the new Member States usually allocate official development aid to their neighbours – the countries of the Western Balkans and the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Moreover, relations between the EU and its Eastern neighbours remain the least developed, and the new Member States, having relative advantage over the old Member States, can have a beneficial influence on the geographical position and nature of development aid policy. The new Member States can also share their recent experience of the transition to a market economy and implementation of good governance, democratic principles and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Meanwhile, the new EU Member States are devoting relatively little attention to the ACP countries. Aid to these countries is mostly of a socio-economic nature: new projects are being developed in the education and health sector; efforts are being made to encourage the development of the public sector and civil society and the principles of gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Documents defining development cooperation policy give no directions on which countries should receive the aid. In view of the limited financial and human resources available to the new Member States, it would be best for them to concentrate their aid on a specific number of countries, offering assistance in the areas in which they have most experience, in both neighbouring and ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="lt">With regard to the problems encountered by the new Member States in pursuing development aid policy, I would like to point out that:</p>
      <p sl="lt">1) The majority of the new Member States still have not defined their key priorities.</p>
      <p sl="lt">2) There is practically no strategic planning or control mechanism in the sphere of development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">3) The level of communication between the bodies implementing development aid policy and NGOs is insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="lt">4) The level of public initiative is too low, and there is a general lack of information on development cooperation available to the public throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In order to achieve greater success in the implementation of development cooperation policy, all countries involved should share their positive experience, taking account of the experience of the new Member States in the East. The new Member States should take part in the preparation of plans for neighbourhood policy implementation activities, ensure a higher degree of participation by national parliaments and increase the activity of NGOs.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nevertheless, I would like to emphasise that the last two EU enlargement rounds have created a new outlook towards development cooperation policy and its inextricable link to the European Neighbourhood Policy, the latter being the direct result of enlargement. Both development cooperation policy and neighbourhood policy are integral components of political and economic relations with other countries.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The institutionalisation of development cooperation policy in the EU would be of great importance for the implementation of the objectives mentioned. It would also enhance the efficiency of the European Neighbourhood Policy alongside that of official development aid and would favourably influence the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="lt">To achieve this we should create an assembly of EU and neighbouring countries, which would cover the Eastern dimension and help to implement the development cooperation and neighbourhood policies. I would like to call on Parliament for its support in this regard.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė, for this excellent report detailing the challenge that development policy poses for the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was reminded by your report of all the discussion and concern expressed in the run-up to enlargement, both among the public generally and in the political world; I recalled the suspicions and fears voiced in various quarters that enlargement would dilute our solidarity with the developing world, pushing Africa down the European Union’s order of priorities. In the event the fears were groundless. The predictions and anxieties were shown to have been unjustified. European development policy has never been as ambitious in its aims or as cohesive in its methods as it is today, and Africa has never ranked higher on the Union’s foreign policy agenda. Your report confirms that this has been achieved not in spite of engagement but by virtue of it, and by virtue of the new Member States’ willingness to shoulder the full weight of their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us look first at the question of financing. Of course the new Member States still have some way to go to meet the targets for 2010; of course it is essential that more countries should produce multiannual plans for stepping up their aid – only four of the 12 countries concerned have so far carried out that exercise – but we simply cannot overlook the collective effort that these 12 Member States have made, for it is quite remarkable. Since joining the Union, these countries have doubled and in some cases tripled the level of aid they provide. In 2007, aid from these 12 states totalled almost EUR 800 million. Moreover, these countries have undertaken to channel 0.33% of their GDP into development aid from the public purse by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The next thing to consider is the effectiveness of the aid. Last year the European Union adopted a code of conduct setting out a number of principles for a better division of labour within the Union. I am pleased to report that the new Member States can hold their heads high with regard to implementation of these principles. All the states concerned apply the principle of concentrating their aid in a limited number of countries – an approach long recognised in best practice as making for greater efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several of the new Member States also deliver their aid in partnership with other Member States under cofinancing arrangements, thus reducing their own and their partner states’ administrative costs. I am thinking here, for example, of support provided jointly by Slovakia and Austria for infrastructure in Kenya and of aid in the water sector delivered by the Czech Republic in partnership with Luxembourg. These are telling examples and they are not isolated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another illustration of efficiency is the fact that the majority of the new Member States support developing countries on the basis of adding value in specific sectors – an approach informed by their own experience of political and economic transition. I could point, for example, to the aid that is directed at good governance, at capacity-building in public administration and at economic reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I see it, these types of action, which are approved in the Code of Conduct on Complementarity and the Division of Labour in Development Policy, are absolutely vital. In April I am to present the first assessment of how the code is being implemented, a year after its adoption, with analyses and proposals for increasing aid and making it more consistent. I intend to use the assessment as a basis for serious discussions with all the Member States about how to proceed from here. Just a few months away from the High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, in Accra, the developing world is counting on Europe to point the way ahead, and rightly so because – let me remind you again – Europe is by far the world’s major source of development aid, so it is capable of leading by example and it has a duty to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your report highlights another fundamentally important point, namely the need for awareness-raising in the new Member States. It is true that most of these countries do not have a long tradition of development aid, particularly to Africa. It is therefore part of our responsibility to keep working on public opinion, getting the message across that this is not just a matter of charity, it is also a matter of mutual interest – and I am thinking here of issues like peace and security, migration, climate change and food security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In mid-February, with all these things in mind, the European Commission launched the third capacity-building programme for the new Member States. Under the programme, the Commission will supply the expertise needed to develop communication strategies that will enable administrative authorities to tell the public more effectively about what they are doing and to raise levels of awareness, particularly in the media and among students, about what is at stake in development policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no longer an ‘old Europe’ or a ‘new Europe’. There is no first class and no second class, no old Member States and no new Member States. There is just one Europe – a supportive, open and politically aware Europe – with values that are not only European but also universal. The evolution of development policy over the years since the latest enlargement is proof in itself that the European Union can grow while at the same time becoming more meaningful. In essence this is a remarkable history lesson, relevant both to the future of development policy and to the future of European integration.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, at a public hearing on the subject of new EU donors, held in the European Parliament in January last year, the participants expressed the hope that the discussion on the development policy of the new EU Member States would continue in the national parliaments and in the further work of the European Parliament itself. I am therefore very pleased to welcome Mrs Budreikaitè’s report, which is the first report in the history of the European Parliament that attempts to analyse the commitment of the new Member States to EU development policy and the challenge it involves for them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is not easy to summarise all the challenges facing the new European donors in formulating national development policies and modernising development policy at Community level. I shall therefore confine myself to a few key issues. First, the role of national parliaments in shaping development aid in the new Member States needs to be strengthened. Without the establishment of a firm legal basis by the national parliaments it will be impossible to pursue an effective development policy and arrive at proper coordination of the planning and management of aid to the developing countries. In some countries work on the necessary legislation has been going on since 2004 and has still not been finalised. As a result, among other things, those countries have no implementing agenda.</p>
      <p sl="pl">More work is need on raising public awareness – and here I agree with Commissioner Michel about public sensitivity in the new Member States with regard to the importance of development policy. In a transition period of this kind, education for development, wide-ranging social consultation, mass communications and information campaigns have an important role to play. Without them, it will be hard to secure taxpayers’ consent for increased public expenditure on development policy. The greater the public awareness, the more readily will society accept the financial burden.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also agree with the Commissioner on the need for European solidarity in development policy. We must coordinate our cooperation and learn from each other. On the one hand, the commitment and knowledge derived from history and the transition period in the new Member States can help the whole European Union to develop and strengthen democracy in countries in transition. On the other, the knowledge derived from the experience of the old Member States, and in particular from their aid to the world’s poorest countries, can help to increase and steer development aid to those countries most in need of it – in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, which is not seen as the main destination for aid in the new Member States. Such mutual education and mutual assistance can make the development policy of the whole European Union more effective.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report that we are discussing today has, in my opinion, the merit of helping the new Member States of the European Union in defining new policies and new mechanisms designed to help countries which receive the attention of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Based on the founding values of the Union and the obligations undertaken under the Treaties to which our countries are a party, the new states are now redefining their policies on the development cooperation granted to the counties that need it, diversifying their cooperation instruments and the areas covered. What the rapporteur said in her foreword is perfectly true, in the sense that priorities are not defined clearly enough and good intentions are often limited by lack of financial resources. It looks like the new Member States still need a period of adaptation to the decision-making systems in the Council and to its priorities in the field of development cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romaniahas a national strategy on international development cooperation, providing that it supports the development of the states in the geographical areas identified as priority areas for external relations, namely Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans and the Southern Caucasus. Another effort refers to the gradual extension of aid to African States, especially in the field of education.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am glad that this year, on 1 October, the European Socialist Day for Development will be held in Bucharest and I want to thank -here and now- my socialist colleagues for unanimously voting in favour of my proposal to organise this event in a new Member State of the European Union, namely Romania. I praise this report which represnents a useful framework of field-related conceptualisation for the new Member States of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on Tuesday the President of the Republic of Estonia, Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves, said that we should cast aside the term ‘new Member States’. That is also part of the title of Ms Budreikaitė’s report. Although I agree in principle with my President, the term has a positive connotation as well, involving innovation and readiness for reforms. Today’s report gives a comprehensive overview of the progress that the new donor countries in the European Union – that were the recipients of similar help a decade ago – have made in the field of development cooperation, pointing out both the shortcomings and the potential for further increase in the contribution to the EU development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 1970 the United Nations agreed upon the target of 0.7% of GDP for development assistance to eradicate extreme poverty – the most humiliating state for human beings. Dear colleagues, do not forget that this concerns approximately one third of the world’s population. Unfortunately, the efforts made so far are clearly not enough. No new Member State has reached the target. The same applies to the old Member States, with the exception of Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. Norway, although not a member of the EU, has also achieved the same goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Ms Budreikaitė for the extensive work that she has done in compiling the draft report and accommodating the amendments made by me and my colleagues on the Committee on Development. The rapporteur has been elected from a new donor country and her report will definitely be studied in great detail in those countries, including Estonia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, the European Consensus on Development is committed to a further increase of the designated funds and I encourage all the Member States to take it seriously. This report is a praiseworthy document that once again reminds us of our commitments, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="23788" name="Adam Bielan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the UEN Group">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mrs Budreikaitė on this excellent report. The document makes reference to the Eastern dimension of EU external relations and the need for a new assembly on the lines of EUROLAT or EUROMED – an assembly that could build on the historical experience of the new Member States in particular, including my own country, Poland.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I fully agree with the rapporteur on this. Europe needs a new vision of a broader sphere of influence extending through the Balkans and the Black Sea region to the southern Caucasus. EU policy with regard to these regions is outdated. The very name ‘European Neighbourhood Policy’ is inappropriate and insulting for countries like Ukraine, which is undoubtedly part of Europe. The name should be changed to ‘European Union Neighbourhood Policy’, as the former Ukrainian foreign minister, Borys Tarasiuk, rightly pointed out at the last meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union must give more support to Ukraine and Georgia and draw them into its sphere of influence. Those countries need our commitment even more than the countries of Central Europe did before the 2004 enlargement. They need an individual approach on the part of the European Union, not a general neighbourhood policy that de facto treats Ukraine in the same way as countries that historically do not belong to Europe. Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus too, are poorer, economically weaker and in greater political difficulty than the countries that joined the Union after 2004.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recent years have seen a significant strengthening of Russia’s position in the region. Russia’s readiness to use its energy reserves for political blackmail deters the European Union from opposing the Kremlin’s shameful practices, which have nothing in common with democracy. In Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow is attempting to reverse the democratic transition. The European Union Neighbourhood Policy, as we ought to call it, must offer immediate political and economic aid to our nearest neighbours. Poland already has projects waiting and ready to go, such as the Bielsat independent television project for Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, coming back to the actual subject of the report, let me give Mrs Budreikaitė very warm thanks for her report, which I regard as very balanced and competent. It is also a particularly important one at this point in time because we can now take provisional stock and also draw conclusions in regard to greater development cooperation on the part of the new Member States, with particular reference to the ACP states.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accession to the EU clearly also means an obligation under the Treaty to accept the achievements of the acquis communautaire. It is also clear, however, that the Treaty is one thing and public awareness of a major area of policy in the various countries is another. The statistics we have been given make that very evident.</p>
      <p sl="de">Development cooperation with the states of Africa, Asia and Latin America often does not look like a particularly urgent issue in countries that are themselves still lagging behind in their economic development. That is why we must jointly push for recognition of the importance of this task and urge that we continue to pursue it, looking back also at the development cooperation that certainly existed in the past with some states, in particular African countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many ties that existed prior to 1989 were dissolved very quickly yet almost without a murmur. There were also some very regrettable episodes. A number of projects that had been started up in those countries now lie in ruins. I think we need to make a new start here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also rather sad that by agreement with the Commission, nearly all the Central and Eastern European Member States are concentrating their development cooperation on cooperation with the former Soviet republics, which sidelines the real objective of development cooperation, namely to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Even if the new Member States were to succeed in raising their ODA to 0.17% by 2010 as agreed, it is to be feared that only a fraction of that amount would go to development and support for the poorest countries in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, let me give warm thanks to Mrs Budreikaitė for her report.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="1956" name="Frank Vanhecke" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">I think that this report has its good points. It gives an interesting overview of the position regarding development cooperation in the new Member States. That is a good thing. Basically, however, I believe this report above all represents a missed opportunity. Rather than encouraging the new Member States to pursue the traditional objectives of European development aid, Parliament would actually do better to debate those same objectives and think about whether it makes sense nowadays just to continue with the traditional form of development aid.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Time and time again this House elevates the financial objectives into a kind of dogma, without any proper debate, and time and time again we refuse to acknowledge the fundamental causes which are at the root of most developing countries' problems. In Africa it is certainly the case that the leading cause of poverty, hunger, insecurity and the enormous social and economic problems in developing countries is actually the fact that they are very badly governed by totally corrupt regimes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The new Member States are being urged here to organise information and awareness-raising campaigns. I am in favour of that, but should we not also inform people of the fact that African nations spend more on arms than they receive in development aid? Or that African rulers have billions stashed away in Swiss banks, to a total greater than many years'-worth of development aid? If there is one signal that Europe ought to be giving out, it is that only democracies where the rule of law applies guarantee people a real chance of improving their lot, and that in those circumstances development aid will be effective and beneficial. At the moment, sadly, it is not.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I praise this report which will be of real help to the new Member States in the fulfilment of the obligations undertaken with respect development development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the recommendations made in the report and I wish to point out two of them, first of all the necessity of a strategy for the education of citizens. It does not mean making citizens of a Member State with a gross domestic income per inhabitant of only 38% of the EU average, such as Romania, understand that they must allot part of the budget resources for the development of other countries, but it is a fundamental value of the European Union that we undertook; and Romania, which is a Member State in this situation, will take action in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also wish to point out the recommendation concerning the transfer of positive experience from the older Member States to the newer Member States to avoid such failures in development cooperation, such as failure in achieving its goal, inefficiency and opening opportunities for corruption in the beneficiary states.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to underline the importance that should be attached to the development cooperation for education and training of human resources. In this context Romania has an extremely positive experience as it awards scholarships to pupils and students from the Republic of Moldova and the South-Western Ukraine. There is a direct relationship between the Romanian universities and schools and the pupils and students of the said countries.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020" speaker_id="28279" name="Justas Vincas Paleckis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="lt">Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė, for the report, which must have taken a lot of time and effort to prepare. It is uplifting to know that in such a short period of time the new Member States have transformed themselves from being assistance recipients to assistance donors. However, most – if not all – of these countries might struggle to achieve the objective of allocating 0.17% of GDP to development assistance by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="lt">What could be the reason? The countries that acceded to the EU in the 21st century are still being stifled by ethnocentrism. They feel that they have suffered the most, are struggling and need the most assistance. Nevertheless, being a part of the EU and participating in development cooperation helps to eliminate narrow-mindedness.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today in Lithuania, where development assistance projects were met with scepticism until recently, the majority of the population believe that such assistance is welcome and necessary. The new Member States are in the advantageous position of being able to share the experience of the transitional period with other regions of the world. We are familiar with the difficulties that our close neighbours in Central Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia are struggling with, as we have recently experienced similar hardships ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, we need to focus our attention and assistance a little further still. It is quite difficult to see poverty in African and Asian countries from the viewpoint of Vilnius, Warsaw, Budapest or Bucharest, but we have to realise that by assisting those in need today we are actually helping ourselves. Every country on this planet is connected with others, as in the ‘law of connected vessels’. The increasing gap between the richest and poorest countries, as well as the unstoppable flood of economic migrants, is eroding the world’s foundations.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Alongside state assistance, civil society organisations play a very important role. The value of money and goods collected through non-governmental organisations, schools and the Church is not very great but is highly appreciated.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, my own country received aid for many years because of the prevailing poverty. Today, after four years’ membership of the European Union, Poland is joining more and more actively in aid to the developing countries. Recently, for example, we wrote off Angola’s very large debt. We are also putting money into support for the elite in the developing countries, by funding scholarships for study in Poland. Our basic assumption is that investing in knowledge and the creation of an elite is no less important than distributing charity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I must say – perhaps taking issue with some of you – that aid to developing countries should not be confined to support for African countries, and I would remind you that the European Consensus of 2005 does not oblige us to direct our development aid to Africa. As a Pole, I am proud that my country, a new Member State, allocates the same percentage of its GNP to aid for developing countries as Greece, which has been in the European Union for 27 years, Portugal, a Member State for 22 years, and Italy, a founder-member of the Community.</p>

      <p sl="et">I would like to thank the rapporteur for a timely and balanced report. I have a couple of remarks to make on matters arising both from earlier debate on the report and from today’s debate in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="et">My first point is about the idea that people’s attitude in the new Member States towards development cooperation and humanitarian aid is lukewarm. I think that awareness-raising has a very important role to play in that respect. A study has been carried out in Estonia comparing attitudes today with those of three years ago and even the figures from three years ago show that awareness of development cooperation had improved to such an extent, not only in the institutions but among the general population, that it enabled considerable budgetary support, or an increase in that support, to be given to development cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is important for the public to know that money is not going into a vast black hole but to specific countries for specific projects. Estonia’s development cooperation is based on the principle that responsibility for development lies primarily with the developing countries themselves: nothing can be achieved by force. For that reason close cooperation is especially important and a very good example of this is provided by the cooperation between Estonia and Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="et">I therefore welcome paragraph 17 of the report, which states that the biggest challenges will be the increase in budgets and awareness-raising, especially among the general public. For example, although the amount allocated to international development by Estonia in 2006 was 0.09% of GDP, the position today is that the amount should rise and we aim to achieve a figure of 0.17% of GDP by the year 2011, in accordance with the development cooperation programme adopted in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="et">I welcome the fact that the proposals made by my colleagues, my Estonian colleagues, were incorporated into the report at the drafting stage and I believe that this marks a fundamental change whereby the new Member States have metamorphosed from recipients of aid into donors of aid; I hope that this support continues to grow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is amazing that 200 million children around the world can be described as child labourers. This is totally unacceptable practice. The international community must work in a more concerted manner to ensure that international codes of practice to combat child labour are rigorously enforced in all countries round the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">This must be a key issue in the context of EU development aid policies at all times. The EU must work more closely with the United Nations, UNICEF, the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation, donors and NGOs to introduce the correct strategies to ensure that uniform laws are in place to stop this inhumane practice of child labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">A multidimensional approach is needed if child labour is to be effectively tackled around the world. Enforced social protection measures and changes to the labour market rules are needed. Child labour and education issues are inextricably linked. Children denied access to education are more likely to be engaged in child labour. The European Union, as the largest donor in the world of development aid, must continue to work aggressively to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are met by 2015, including the targets set by the international community relating to availability of education to all children in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, helping others when you yourself are still in need of help is indeed proof of solidarity. It is demonstrated by the actions of the 12 states that recently joined the European Union, and it should be appreciated. Last November I showed what Poland was doing in this respect through an exhibition entitled Polish aid to the world. So I am very grateful to Mrs Budreikaitė for her complex presentation of the subject.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The point of the Millennium Goals, which we have been discussing for years, is to help people who live in poverty, including millions of undernourished children. Such help, however, should consist in providing a fishing rod and angling skills rather than putting fish on the plate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must also strive to achieve a fairer system of trade with third-world countries. There is a need for generosity on the part of donors in writing off debts and for widespread sharing of scientific achievements, especially in medicine. Let us support schools and universities in these countries, so that their graduates can work to meet the needs of their fellow countrymen. Let us help resolve the shortage of drinking water. We inhabitants of the European Union make up barely 7.5% of the world population but we take up 23% of world GNI. Of course, we in Europe have problems of our own, including economic problems. But we must keep them in perspective. Let us not be indifferent to the suffering of those who are hungry, sick or uneducated, who live in poverty, deprivation or mortal danger.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to come back to a remark the Commissioner made in his introductory statement, namely that we should not just give development aid but could and should also link it to general concerns – not in the sense of the kind of power politics and strings-attached policies once pursued by the USA and the former Soviet Union and pursued by Russia and China today, but in the sense of aiming at good governance, human rights and fighting corruption. Those are concerns that we should all emblazon on our banners – and I am not referring only to the new Member States and their development aid policy but to all of us. Perhaps we could take this as a practical opportunity to place even more emphasis on those concerns.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, of course the report is very useful. Development in this area is very dynamic and even ahead of the report. For example, the report does not reflect the fact that some new Member States have already set up development organisations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, I would like to talk about something else. I would like to dispel the widely held myth that the new Member States have no experience in this area. We have this experience, although we gained it when Europe was divided, behind the Iron Curtain, in a different regime when everything was ideologically and politically motivated. The fact remains that we used to build power stations and breweries, and provide agricultural aid to developing countries. By the way, we are still due money since then and some debts are quite large, but that does not matter now. We simply have the know-how. I would like to see this know-how being used. I would also like to use this opportunity to ask the Commission not to think of the new Member States as wet behind the ears but rather to make effective use of their existing knowledge.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to pick up where my colleague Mr Zahradil left off. He is perfectly right. In the past Czechoslovakia, just like other countries of the Soviet bloc, was active in developing countries. Our country successfully participated in helping the economies of these countries and now we can tap into this potential.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There are also some negatives though due to the fact that external growth resources can never replace internal resources: the economies that find themselves in this situation are often incapable of developing from the inside.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Some time ago, actually quite a long time ago, Gunnar Myrdal published his book ‘Asian Drama’. In this book he contrasts the optimism felt after World War II for example in Africa with the pessimism prevailing in Asian countries. Today the situation is quite different. Many Asian countries show strong growth while Africa attracts only 2% of world investment and the economies in many of its countries are in dire straits.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is also the connection with the behaviour of the ruling elites in these two regions, which was in sharp contrast. One French study compares the behaviour of these elites and shows that while the Asian elite invested in the economy, the African elite hoarded resources that had been created and removed them from their own territories.</p>

    <intervention id="4-028" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly I need to begin by thanking all the speakers for the very high quality of their contributions and the relevance of the points made, which closely mirror my own concerns. I should also like, at the outset, to thank the Slovenian Presidency, which has taken a remarkably refreshing approach: it is working to encourage and energise thinking about development policy in the new Member States and has already organised two extremely productive meetings to discuss these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the comments made about levels of aid – that is, about the amounts of money needed – I fully understand the difficulty facing the new Member States. I would remind you however – indeed, you yourselves have already made the point in a general way – that there are many alternative methods of getting involved and using transfers of expertise, which cost very little. I heard one speaker, for example, referring to projects for cooperation in education. Obviously, sending instructors or teachers to African countries costs relatively little but it nonetheless constitutes an extremely important contribution to those countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The underlying question suggested here, as to whether the new Member States would not do better to invest in their own neighbourhood – neighbourhood is not, perhaps, the best word and I may yet think of a better one – as opposed to investing in Africa, is, in my opinion, the wrong question. I fully realise that investment in the neighbourhood is more obviously attractive and easier to justify and that it is more appealing both to public opinion in your countries and to potential development-policy partners. The one approach does not, however, exclude the other and it sets a quite exceptional educational example to young people to see a nation deciding to extend its aid commitment to Africa, to open up to Africa, because it expresses values that are both European in the deepest sense and also universal. Let me say, further, that the basis on which I have made my case for the new Member States having a presence in Africa is the fact that some of your countries have already had experience there, and that experience has generally left quite positive traces, notably in relation to the construction of certain states and certain state services and in the form of real expertise that has been retained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point, ladies and gentlemen, is that Africa is not on target to achieve the Millennium Goals. The goals will be realised in all the developing countries except in Africa. So I would argue, on that basis, that it is part of our responsibility, or our co-responsibility, not to reduce investment in Africa, and I would stress again, echoing one of the speakers, that investment can be sustained through exchanges of expertise. Giving our universities, colleges, municipalities and local authorities encouragement or incentives to get involved in exchanges with developing countries is obviously a relatively low-cost approach and it is an effective one. I must say, too, that I am very willing to invite representatives of the so-called ‘new’ Member States to come with me on some of my missions. I believe it is extremely important that they should see for themselves not only the issues at stake but also the truly tragic situations confronting certain countries and certain peoples.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to conclude with an aspect that offers great potential for added value – probably greater potential than we have in some of our own countries, as has been pointed out – namely the whole area of governance. After all, what do we actually mean by governance? Governance is the ability of a state to assume its major sovereign functions and to provide its people with a basic level of social services. I believe you have a tremendous amount to contribute in terms of governance: that is, everything entailed in building a state and – to underscore a point made, I think, by Mr Lambsdorff – everything concerning the journey from a period of transition towards the building of a state or of more definitive structures. I am thinking here of tax collection, of the establishment of administration at local level, of the principle of subsidiarity and of decentralisation. All these aspects are clearly of fundamental importance in building states that will be genuinely capable of serving their people, and it is obvious that you can play an important role here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe it would be useful – and it is something I will propose – to invite the 12 so-called ‘new’ Member States to work with the Commission on the basis of the tenth European Development Fund programme. The current position is that we have more or less completed the programming of the tenth European Development Fund, and it would be a worthwhile exercise to involve the new Member States in determining, country by country, how they feel they could best be associated with it. We could look to them, for example, to offer training in the areas of justice, administration or education, or they could be asked to make available certain experts. For instance, some of the new Member States have expertise in the field of e-government and this type of expertise is much in demand in certain African countries. That is why I am making my proposal. I think it has been important to have this discussion and I recognise there are some very useful avenues to pursue. That said, I would suggest that if we really want to be effective and to move matters forward we should plan to meet representatives from the 12 countries concerned very soon and actively address the issues so that we can actually produce joint programmes in the weeks ahead. I believe this is a chance that we cannot afford to miss.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, you have talked about conditionality and I can fully understand that point of view. Everything concerning values, human rights, respect for human rights and combating corruption is obviously important, I agree, but in some cases it can be very difficult and even counterproductive to link development aid to – or make it contingent on – the strict observance of such values, dear to us though they undoubtedly are. What has to be recognised is that imposing a value-related link or condition in countries where this type of requirement is not respected will hurt, in the first place, the ordinary people of those countries. Our response to the problem, in countries where good governance is not respected, is to work in conjunction with specific operators, either indirect local operators or NGOs or agencies representing the United Nations. We offer budget support only to countries that can guarantee a minimum level of good governance. So I think there can be no doubt that we are on the same wavelength insofar as that approach is concerned. As for the values that I referred to – they are the values that we consistently convey. We constantly attempt to promote and push these values through political dialogue. Implementing strict conditionality is difficult, however, if we genuinely want to help the people on the ground and that is, after all, the main aim.</p>

      <p sl="lt">My sincere thanks to everyone who has taken part in the discussion and supported my report. I would also like to thank all the members of the Committee on Development for having voted unanimously in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to highlight several issues. The ‘new Member States’ – actually, the name continues to be sort of conditional, making it easier to distinguish between the ‘old’ Member States and those that acceded to the EU after two enlargement rounds, owing to their particular historical background and perhaps the fact that they are poorer than the old ones.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I want to mention the experience of development cooperation policy. This policy initially started to be applied in 1958. Central European countries – the Czech Republic, Slovakia and others – have had more experience of participating in development cooperation. Participation by the Baltic States was much more limited. Nevertheless, my country is currently involved in delivering oceanological assistance to Mauritius, an African country. The progress is evident.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Why do I emphasise the ‘Eastern’ dimension, ‘Eastern countries’? They happen to be very important neighbours of ours. It is pointless to try to demarcate the neighbourhood and development cooperation policies or to have politicians debate their details. These notions are interconnected. In Belarus, our neighbour, some people survive on less than two dollars a day. Which group of countries does this country belong to, then? These countries are backward too and are asking for help, insisting that they should receive assistance. We all want our neighbours to have a decent quality of life. We therefore appear to be pursuing the same global objectives.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We are involved in assisting African countries in fighting poverty, lowering the level of migration, increasing quality of life, boosting their economy, enabling them to battle diseases and become self-reliant. While we are assisting neighbouring countries to fight poverty, giving a helping hand whenever we can and where we have the relevant experience, we are helping to bring about stabilisation all over Europe and in the Balkan Region.

      <p sl="ro">Although the draft resolution being debated has ambitious goals, I believe it will be hard to achieve a common policy in the near future, even from as a matter of principle. Although we all form a large family, each EU Member State has its own priorities with respect to the countries or geographical regions to which regional development cooperation is currently provided; of , priorities which are motivated by economic, geopolitical, ethnic, historical interests etc., and it is unlikely that this pattern can change significantly. The recent incident related to the declaration of independence by Kosovo showed a lack of unity among the Member States in terms of opinion and, on the same grounds, it is likely that the same diversity of opinion will be shown when the matter under discussion is the situation of our extra-community neighbours. It is true that a major step was taken with the appointment, under the Lisbon Treaty, of an EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs. However, thanks to lack of clear rules on the determination of community priorities, each Member State will try to promote and focus on development policies, including financial (allotments from the Union budget) on such extra-community regions that coincide with their own priorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five days ago we celebrated the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. Much has been achieved, yet there is still no evidence of equal opportunities in the poorest countries of this world. The human rights of women and of the girl-child are still far from being an unalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights, called for in the United Nations Vienna Declaration of 1993.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my report I dealt in detail with the situation of women and girls in developing countries and I have also looked at ways in which European development cooperation can improve the lives of these women. Let me briefly quote a few facts and figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two thirds of all illiterates in the world are women. More than 40% of women in Africa have not attended primary school. In Africa, women make up 52% of the total population but perform 75% of the agricultural work and produce and market 60-80% of the food.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s updated strategy for women’s equality and participation in development cooperation addresses important areas and proposes concrete measures to promote equality. The dual approach of the strategy, making gender mainstreaming more efficient and also proposing separate measures to promote equality, is welcome. I also applaud the 41 practical measures in the areas of responsible governance, employment, the economy, education, health and violence against women. Nonetheless, in my report I have criticised several points. Let me discuss the most important ones briefly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that combating traditional forms of violence should lie at the heart of the measures to combat violence against women. Secondly, I must say I am rather taken aback that the strategy fails to mention the Economic Partnership Agreements. At no point is reference made to the link between strengthening the role of women and the economic agreements between the EU and the ACP States. As for the specific situation of women in conflicts, I regret the fact that the strategy fails to comment on the specific role that women play in what are called weak states and in the least developed countries. Special attention should also be paid to the reproductive health and sexual rights of women in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much regret that most of the draft amendments are once again concerned only with deleting passages from the report that call for the right of women freely and independently to decide about their body and their life. I do not want to sound boastful, but my report should not be reduced to that issue. In this connection I welcome the amendments proposed by Mrs Buitenweg on behalf of the Greens and thank her for her important contributions.</p>
      <p sl="de">On reproductive health, I just want to say the following at this point: every woman has the right to decide freely and independently about her body and her life. Women’s full access to sexual and reproductive health is a prerequisite for achieving gender equality. So long as women are refused that access, it will be others who decide about women’s bodies and lives. Surely nobody seriously concerned with Europe’s humanist tradition, with our shared values and with respect for human rights could want that!</p>

    <intervention id="4-036" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this extremely thorough examination of a very important cross-cutting subject. Greater participation by women in the economy and the fair sharing of power between men and women are actually prerequisites for development. If we cannot ensure gender equality in development we will never achieve either the Millennium Goals or sustainable economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why in sub-Saharan Africa do women constitute only 34% of the workforce in regular employment? Why do these women’s earnings represent only 10% of total income and why do women own only 1% of the assets? Obviously these questions are extremely important. And why, as your report points out, do women make up 70% of the 1.3 billion people living in absolute poverty? What is illustrated here is a very particular kind of tragedy intrinsically associated with being female. Sadly there are too many such questions that we need to answer. Even in Europe, even in our Member States’ national parliaments with their reasonably high levels of female participation, there is no guarantee that women’s priorities will always be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to our policy towards partner countries, we recognise the need to engage in really thoroughgoing political dialogue. I can tell you that dialogue on the issue of gender equality is not always straightforward: it can involve, for example, helping to ensure the breakdown of statistics by gender; or insistence that budgeting should take more account of the social sector, for in many cases education and health are not real priorities, although it is well known that women’s education and health are keys to development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All these concerns are central to the Communication entitled Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Development Cooperation, adopted by the Commission on 8 March 2007. The policy set out there constitutes a response to commitments made in the European Consensus on Development with regard to gender equality in all our cooperation policies and practices. The aim of the communication is to develop a European vision and to offer consistent support for the promotion of gender equality in all developing regions and countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The communication is also a guide to new aid modalities, notably budget support. I take issue here with the criticisms expressed in your report, for I believe that budget support offers new opportunities for effectively furthering gender equality. Why so? I have already outlined on a number of occasions the reasons why, insofar as possible, I have favoured budget support. The fact of engaging in budget support gives us incomparably greater leverage in political dialogue with the authorities of the partner country concerned. It enables us, for example, to discuss policy options and, among other things, the need for better promotion of women’s potential in a country’s economic and social development. Moreover, in such cases, we base our support on the verification of tangible results presented or revealed via indicators that are always gender-specific and therefore clearly highlight gender gaps where they exist. The objectives that we use to measure a country’s results are in line with the Millennium Goals and, for the most part, are highly relevant to the improvement of women’s living conditions. They include, to name but a few, increasing the proportion of girls attending school and increasing the number of ante-natal check-ups. The progress that a country makes towards meeting such targets is the basis on which the European Commission disburses variable tranches of budget support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the speakers in the debate mentioned a form of conditionality. When you engage in budget support you are clearly able, to some extent, to oblige the partner to respect criteria and observe certain types of conditionality. In terms of positive influence, there is a stronger effect than there would be without the mechanism of budget support. Be that as it may, I am prepared to pursue this debate in other contexts. I am deeply convinced, however, on the basis of my experience to date, that budget support – where it is possible – is obviously a much more efficient way to proceed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For a number of years we have taken a twin-track approach. Firstly, we integrate gender equality into all our policies and actions, including as part of budget-support arrangements and in political dialogue with our partners. One of the consequences of this approach is a need to train our colleagues who take part in delegations on gender-related issues. Since 2004, more than a thousand of them have received specific ‘gender’ training and we have now set up a gender helpdesk to pursue this training in the future. Secondly, we finance specific actions to advance male-female equality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Actions of this type are included in certain national indicative programmes but, more importantly, there are also thematic programmes that complement geographically-based cooperation. For example, ‘Investing in human resources’ and ‘Human rights and democracy’ programmes incorporate specific elements for furthering gender equality. The ‘Investing in human resources’ programme has EUR 57 million for targeted ‘gender’ activities between 2007 and 2013: that is an annual average roughly three times higher than our spending up to 2006. Of course, gender equality is also incorporated into other thematic programmes whether for education, health or agriculture, or indeed for environment and culture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we still have a long way to go but I am convinced that, with a shared commitment to promoting gender equality and, most importantly, in cooperation with women in the developing countries, we will be capable of fighting poverty and building fairer societies.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Draftswoman, Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. − Dear colleagues, I see that the report has already provoked reactions. We hope it is a proof of its political relevance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s Communication was a very good premise and the Parliament added useful specifications. I would only like to explain the principle at the basis of this position. The objective was clear, we support women’s role in development cooperation. Apart from arguments related to equality, there is enough proof that women are a good investment as they are excellent multipliers of results.</p>
      <p sl="ro">But how do we get maximum efficiency in achieving the goal? We could have requested strict criteria from the beneficiary states on strengthening \ women’s position. As a matter of fact such criteria already exist. However, we can also expect poor reactions, lack of both expertise and administrative capacity, formal commitments in the strategic development plans and lack of implementation of such commitments. Non-compliance with obligations may result in the diminishing or suspension of aid. It would negatively affect the final beneficiaries, and women would end up paying for the incompetence of governments, and we do not want that.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Under these conditions, we chose to insist on compliance with those requirements that we control and for which we have the action means. For this reason, we ask the Commission and the Member States to ensure consistency between other Community policies and development policy. Otherwise, certain aspects of domestic commercial policy or of the common agricultural policy may negatively interfere with our goals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given the significant differences overgender issue in the policy of the Member States, we believe that the drafting of the European Commission roadmap on gender equality within the Union is a pre-condition for true and efficient use of women in developing development cooperation, which is a policy primarily managed by the Member States. The new means for granting support seem to have weakened the attention given to women.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We request an assessment of their gender impact and adequate correction measures, subject to the responsibilities and transparency of funds use undertaken before the European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Although I do not agree with everything in the report by our colleague Mrs Uca, I would like to congratulate her on the consistency and accuracy of her approach to this topic. When debating this matter we should underscore our support for women’s dignity and their role in acting for the common good in society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In developing countries (but not just there) many women suffer from discrimination and violence, often work in poor conditions and for low salaries, lack basic health care, work too many hours and face humiliation and physical abuse. That is the reason for inadequate development. All these factors also have an impact on the quality of their family life. Boosting development and enhancing equality in order to promote peace in the 21st century: these are the concrete steps that can help to improve the situation if we take them. We have to condemn repeatedly, uncompromisingly and at every opportunity the sexual violence often suffered by women and young girls. We must encourage developing countries to adopt laws that will offer women effective protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the name of respect for each individual we also have to condemn a very widespread quasi-culture, leading to systematic sexual exploitation and destroying the dignity of even very young girls by forcing them to offer their bodies and so contribute to the billions in profits raked in by the sex industry. Unfortunately, their clients come mostly from the civilised parts of the world, including the European Union. Women in areas of military conflicts are victims of systematic rape for political purposes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I appreciate that there are women’s movements working to enhance the dignity of women. When looking at the issue of helping women in developing countries we must not forget that apart from financial aid from development funds there is an effective net of religious and charity organisations. This initiative has for many years enjoyed the support of local churches, through parallel schemes and informal micro-loans to the poor. It is very uplifting to see the patient, honest and hard work of poor women being rewarded in this way. This also has to be supported by reforming the structures that help to expand the success of new initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Women must be granted equal opportunities, fair pay, equality on the employment ladder, equal access to education at all levels, access to health care and equality in family affairs. Women’s involvement in politics needs courage but progress made by women in developing countries is progress for us all.</p>

Virtually all countries signed up to the Millennium Development Goals eight years ago. Half the time has already passed and it looks as if most of the Goals are not going to be met in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Women play an essential part in combating poverty, but they still do not have equal access to education, healthcare, employment or property ownership. Their social status is low and violence against women is widespread. At the same time, most of our partner countries' strategic programmes simply ignore women altogether. So the gender dimension really must be placed centre-stage in the political dialogue with our partner countries and women's organisations must be involved in the framing of policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I find it monstrous that colleagues from the EPP and UEN Groups want to remove the report's plain speaking on sexual and reproductive health, because if women are able to make decisions about their own bodies and whether and when they have children, not only will this save millions of women's lives; children too will have more opportunities and communities will be made stronger. Anyone who denies that undermines the consensus on population and development which the international community endorsed in 1994, and we will not allow that to happen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One final word: I am one hundred percent in favour of the Green Group's call for a European Envoy for Women's Rights. A women's envoy will give the world's women a face and a voice in Europe and its governments and may also on occasion remind the Commissioners of the commitments they have given.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, gender equality and women’s empowerment are values and principles that we all praise in the European Union. As such, they definitely need to be shared with the developing countries within the framework of existing cooperation. We all have a huge responsibility when addressing them because promoting double standards would morally outlaw us, and we certainly lose credibility. I am referring specifically now to the amendments tabled for voting today, the same amendments that were rejected by the Committee on Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fear that we risk using different yardsticks when, on the one hand, we express these values to our development partners and when, on the other hand, we use them inside the European Union. We cannot afford to exclude references to reproductive rights from this report because this is a core topic when we target the promotion of women’s rights and their empowerment.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the report correctly emphasises, women’s full enjoyment of their sexual and reproductive health and rights is a prerequisite for achieving gender equality. The protection of reproductive rights, such as planning their family in terms of birth timing and spacing, and decision-making regarding reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence, provides women with the freedom to participate more fully and equally in society.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot go only halfway towards our partners and claim at the same time that our goal is to have healthier and stronger women who are able to participate actively and equally in society. Please excuse my tough words but to me this is mere hypocrisy. We will fail to achieve these goals if we start by excluding core issues or give a different impression of our principles, different to what we have back home.</p>
      <p sl="de">In today’s world, promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in the developing countries is not an easy task. Reaching these targets implies a genuine commitment and action and, most of all, it implies our good faith in our relations with developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, 750 million women are living in poverty, and these women are fighting for their own survival as well as that of their families. As Europeans we must fight alongside them for their right to a better life. The role of women is inestimable; yet their abilities and potential are not appreciated. Their access to education, work and property is severely restricted. It should be one of the principal tasks of the EU to ensure that women are placed at the centre of development work involving the EU. As things stand, our policies all too often end up lowering the already low status of women, and for this reason I am very pleased with Mrs Uca’s report.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is important not to dilute this report, as many in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are attempting to do through their amendments, which would remove all talk of women having sexual and reproductive rights. As has been said many times already, these rights are crucial to enable women to take responsibility for their own and thus their families’ lives. This is often a matter of life or death for them. Women must have the right and opportunity to say ‘no’, in order to avoid violence and to obtain an education and the opportunity to set up on their own. This is crucial if development is to result from our development aid, and it is both immoral and foolish not to put women at the centre of this work.</p>
      <p sl="da">Unfortunately, the political will is lacking, of course – as has also been said – and thus many of us support a proposal for the appointment of an EU High Representative for women. He or she should ensure that women are involved in political and social work worldwide, bringing to bear the influence they ought to have as half of the world’s population. Women must not become victims or poor wretches. We all need them to be put on an equal footing with all of us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what can I say? All credit to the Commission for a well-structured communication which for the first time sets out a European strategy for gender equality in development cooperation, in keeping, moreover, with the demands put forward by vast groups of women who refuse to be victims. On the contrary, we refuse to be victims and are protagonists of our lives and our sexuality and it is we who decide on the type of society in which we want to live: a society able to tackle and put an end to discrimination, injustice, violence and the militarisation of states and minds.</p>
      <p sl="it">All credit as well to Mrs Uca’s report which looks in greater depth at and grasps the aspects that the Commission has not taken into account, which I think the Commission should accept. Here, I do not need to reiterate the figures on women living in abject poverty, women who are illiterate and suffering from AIDS or malaria and the many women victims of physical and sexual violence, especially in their homes, even in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Practical measures are the ones that count: governance, education, health, violence against women, access to property and work and, as Mrs Uca says, EU economic and commercial policies which do not run counter to development policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is needed is a much stronger mainstreaming policy and that requires a major commitment of financial and human resources to the Commission’s delegations and to those projects having a major impact, such as micro-credit. These are practical measures likely to bring about a permanent relationship with women’s movements in local and national situations, with the networks of women from different countries set up to campaign against desertification, for urgent conflict resolution, and for the right to health, housing and water.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to say something about the amendments aiming to remove the references to the various international strategies – from Cairo to Maputo – on women’s reproductive health and free reproductive rights.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Report on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Development Cooperation deals with problems affecting women in African and Asian countries, for example. It sets out a strategy involving measures in various categories: gender equality, the political system, employment, education, health, and violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we know, equal rights for women and men are a major aspect of social development enshrined in our European civilisation in basic regulations on respect for human rights and all people. But equal rights and non-discrimination against women are not the only condition for social development. There are a whole series of factors that are important for social progress, starting with compliance with ethical and moral principles that guarantee a signification reduction in exploitation, violence, cheating and other forms of manipulation, including discrimination against and oppression of women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The dramatic living conditions of women in the African countries are the result of a policy of pillaging natural resources and of speculation by international companies that enrich themselves at the cost of the life and health of the local population. Budget support and other EU programmes will not compensate for the losses inflicted by a robber economy. Ethical relativism, too, favours sexual exploitation and the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. Sexual freedom as propagated robs women of their dignity by reducing them to sex objects and encourages violence. The situation of women will be improved not by more funding for contraception and abortion, but by financial support for families, especially those with many children, so as to make education and development possible and to improve health care and social protection, especially for pregnant women. Educated women with a predisposition for leadership or a desire to engage in politics should of course be able to stand for election and use their psycho-physical difference to broaden the spectrum of views on matters of importance not only for women and children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, gender mainstreaming as a central idea – which has brought us paternity leave, among other things – has already had the results that might have been expected, since Swedish fathers are not alone in preferring elk hunting or reading the newspaper to looking after children. The tyranny of sexual aggression spread by the mass media influences …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Uca’s report deals with the important issue of gender equality in development cooperation. Unfortunately, the rapporteur’s undoubtedly positive intentions are undermined by an excessive and controversial presentation of the issue of health and sexual and reproductive rights. This subject ought not to be treated controversially, but the report uses the paradoxical language so frequently employed in the European Union. It is precisely this strange use of language that is distancing the EU from its citizens and turning it into a unintelligible, alienated bureaucratic machine. That is also how we are creating and nourishing opponents of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore hope the PPE-DE Group’s amendments will be accepted by this House. Why? Because by “health and reproductive rights” the author and promoters of this report mean the opposite of what those words actually say. “Reproductive rights” does not mean the restriction of reproduction. What we are doing is giving a positive name to something that has negative consequences, namely the restriction of reproduction. That is outright deception.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Those who advocate restricting the population in poor countries and promoting contraception or abortion should not hide behind terms like health and reproductive rights. We should call a spade a spade. It seems to me they don’t want to do so because they suspect the European Union should not really be concerning itself with such matters. Is there not something dubious about Europeans promoting and funding contraception and abortion outside Europe? In Africa and Asia, just as in the EU, it is individual states that should decide what policy to pursue in this area. The report says women should decide. But it is we who are telling these women in Africa what to do. I think there is some confusion here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another point: there is no relation of cause and effect between having a large number of children and equality. The two things are unconnected, and I fail to understand why this report makes a connection between them.</p>

      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">By refusing to countenance in the report any consideration of, or reference to, the problems of contraception, the UEN is effectively refusing to recognise that women in the southern hemisphere are entitled to a decent life. It is more than scandalous, it is irresponsible and hypocritical, when we know that the absence of proper family planning condemns millions of people across the world to unnecessary suffering, illness and death – the hardest hit being women and the children that they bring into the world, all too often against their own wishes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group are no less regrettable. They merely formulate the ideas differently, particularly by refusing to consider recognition of a woman’s right to control her own fertility. In the great majority of developing countries, women and girls – even young girls – continue to suffer significant forms of discrimination and quite intolerable violence. Anyone rejecting the view that each individual woman in those countries should be entitled to full control of her own destiny is obviously refusing to regard these women as the equals of men. Yet reproductive health should not be such an alarming subject: it simply implies enabling people to experience responsible, satisfying and safe sexuality, and giving women the freedom to choose to have children if and when they want children. This concept of health depends on women and men being able to choose, on a basis of equality, methods of regulating fertility that are safe, effective, affordable and acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is important is that we be clear about what we want. For too long a discussion which should be dealing with human rights has been poisoned by various political considerations. It goes without saying that a woman has a right to her own body. This is why I did not dodge the question, in the debate on genital mutilation, whether the application of Sharia law amounts to not recognising the equal value of human beings. No one would think of refusing a man the right to decide on his own reproduction or say that it was a question of cultural values to refuse a man the possibility of earning his own money and maintaining his own independence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When the EU, which is the world’s biggest aid provider, acts in the Third World, our values must always be clear. Human rights – by which I understand equality not just in theory but also in practice – must be the watchword. We must make it clearly understood that the market economy is good for poor women and men, not bad. That is demonstrated not least by the successful campaign for micro-credit, which has created both prosperity and empowerment for millions of vulnerable women.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Of course, it is not for us in the rich world to force a particular way of life on other people, but we have, as I think it is important to point out, a responsibility to render possible choices where there are no choices today. Like many of my colleagues here, therefore, I am truly disappointed to see some of the amendments tabled to an otherwise good and important report. They really do point in the wrong direction.</p>

I think that I actually became a better parent than I had been before. Certainly, I read the papers, but my main responsibility was to look after my children and to do it together with my wife.

Why, then, are the Socialists, Liberals and some others preparing this morning to vote against an amendment which seeks information on discrimination against females and which starts in the womb?</p>
      <p sl="en">An amendment in my name and that of Mr Deva and Ms Belohorská calls on the Commission to ask all of the Union’s partners around the world, both governments and NGOs, to undertake a permanent gender analysis of all abortions and to regularly report the findings to Parliament. Perhaps Mr Hutchinson might tell us what is so terrible about getting that information? Parliament is, this morning, planning to look the other way by voting down this amendment, yet in some countries a strong preference for sons has led to the elimination of millions of girls through parental sex selection. Baby girls also die through deliberate neglect and starvation. According to the UNFPA, in Asia alone, at least 60 million girls are ‘missing’. In some countries it is reported that sex selection is more common in cities, where technologies such as amniocentesis and ultrasound are readily available and open to misuse. In others it occurs more commonly in rural areas where, according to UNFPA, the preference for sons is strong. Daughters are in some countries seen as an economic liability and, according to UNFPAs, the sex ratio at birth, although it is slightly higher, becomes more accentuated because of this. The shortage of women and girls in some Asian countries has potentially alarming social repercussions, including increased demand for trafficking in women, whether for marriage or for sex work, and the worsening of their status overall. Those are the words of the UNFPA, not mine.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is Parliament’s position? To look the other way. Throughout history, majorities have got it wrong, for example in Austria and Germany in the 1930s.

If we want to give women the right to make decisions concerning their bodies, why do we not give their unborn children the same opportunity to decide between life or death? I support the amendments tabled by my colleagues from the PPE-DE and UEN political groups in this regard and I thank my colleagues for their courage to include them. I will not vote for the report if these amendments are not adopted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur. I am sorry this debate has focused so strongly on sexual and reproductive rights, because there are many other important issues in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems to me that the UN and a number of conservatives are acting as though sexual and reproductive rights relate only to abortion. In that case I would advise them to check the facts and look at them closely: to be against contraception, against information, against giving women access to these services will only further increase the number of abortions. I find it more than cynical that those same people stand up and pretend they have a monopoly on ethics and morals.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of the statistics we hear from the United Nations and the World Population Monitoring Report every year, it is unethical and immoral to come out against sexual and reproductive rights here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are discussing gender equality and women’s empowerment and development cooperation. I am increasingly saddened by the fact that every time we have a debate around these issues, it descends into a very intolerant debate around sexual health and reproductive rights for women. It is a tragedy. It is one of the ongoing tragedies in this Parliament that we cannot see the bigger picture about the importance of education and micro-credit.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not be supporting most of the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues. It is not that I am not concerned. It is not that I am not concerned about the rate of sex selection that disposes of female foetuses in China and everywhere else. Of course we all have concerns about what is going on there. It is because, truly, I am not convinced that the motives for putting down these amendments are in what the amendment actually says.</p>
      <p sl="en">If our colleagues were against abortion I would respect them putting down a motion against abortion because I think sex selection of male foetuses to them is as much of a concern as female foetuses …</p>

      <p sl="bg">The Millennium Development Goals can be achieved through balancing all policies – family, school, university, healthcare, economy – in which women should be pivotal. In our cooperation programmes we have to emphasize on the right of women to be healthy, including reproductive health.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We should also think of the women’s economic independence which is a prerequisite for the development of entrepreneurship and the fine-tuned use of their entire potential. It is particularly important to speak of shared responsibilites at all levels, national and international alike, shared responsibilities between men and women. This pertains to all walks of life and to all sectors of the economy.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this report was preceded by a very heated debate in the committee at the start of the year, and it seems this debate is continuing today here in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I consider women’s health services in general to be a very important component of human rights. These definitely extend to services relating to sexual and reproductive health.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is not only a problem in developing countries: according to what I heard yesterday about the United States of America, 40% of young teenage girls have sexually transmitted diseases. Mere education and responsibility are not enough even in the western world.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the developing countries the situation is far worse. HIV among women is on the increase, as is sexual violence against women. The provision of sexual and reproductive services in the developing countries is not about abortion either; it is about women knowing what options they have and knowing that they have a right to make their own choices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak on this because, in the heat of the debate, I think I want to bring matters down to a more practical level. The reality is stated in the explanatory statement, for example in Africa, where women make up 52% of the population but perform 75% of the agricultural work and produce and market up to 80% of food. I think the role of women in development in terms of food production is often ignored.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I do take exception to the paragraph in the explanatory statement, which is historic and not up to date, in relation to a comment it makes about the common agricultural policy, which I absolutely disagree with. Europe is the largest importer of produce from the developing world. We have the Everything But Arms agreement and we will soon, perhaps, have a world trade agreement. But I think we need, as the World Bank says, to invest again in agriculture and food production, and we need to do that through women.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will be very brief because I presume there is not time to speak at any length.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should just like to pick up on Mrs Gomes’ question. Why do the country strategy papers contain so few specific actions on the issue of gender? The answer is simple: the country strategies are worked out and decided by the partner countries themselves because they have to choose two sectors on which to focus and we do not dictate what sectors they should select. I would, however, emphasise that we insist on gender questions being taken into consideration throughout the entire course of projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lambsdorff, I understand why you find it hard to accept the lack of cohesion in the European Union’s position in New York, but I think you need to take that up with the Council rather than the Commission, for it is not something that the Commission can rectify. That said, I would obviously echo your desire for a more cohesive position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Very briefly – and there may be those among you who find my words provocative – I should like to share with you my own conviction: I fully agree with those who regard reproductive health as a precondition for women’s equality. Personally, I do not see how we can address the subject and tackle this question without agreeing on that precondition, just as we agree on access to school, access to work and access to micro-credit. All these things are clearly important in themselves but ultimately it comes down to creating conditions in which women can choose freely. That is a basic principle of gender equality and it cannot be denied!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I would also invite anyone who might be in any doubt about the human tragedy of women’s circumstances in certain developing countries to come and see for themselves and to hear the stories that some women could tell them about the anguish of their own experience. That is all I wanted to say: there is little to add. Thank you again for the high quality of the debate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Equal opportunities and equal access for women and men to resources and participation in public life are of decisive importance not only outside the EU, in the framework of sustainable development, they are also extremely important for many women in the European Union itself. I will give you an example: in Poland, in my own region, Silesia, women working day-to-day in favour of equality between women and men are worried that gender mainstreaming, i.e. gender policy, is not properly incorporated in regional economic, political and cultural action.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Women meeting in Katowice on 8 March 2007 proclaimed that ‘gender policy is not promoted by the local authorities or the media – either publicly or privately – despite the fact that Poland joined the EU almost 4 years ago.’ They added that the Silesian authorities were apparently not convinced by the slogan ‘Democracy without women is only half democracy’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Following the recent elections there are one-third fewer women in Silesian politics. So how can one speak of women’s equality? That is why Silesian women are demanding that the local authorities ensure them equal involvement in local government and the decision-making process, access to promotion and the pursuit of business activities, equal opportunities with regard to employment, working conditions and pay, and freedom from violence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, whatever one thinks of the current debate on climate change – and I can sense a lot of hot air all around me – I think we can all agree on the need for more energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, if we are going to talk about energy efficiency, let us make sure that we actually have some joined-up thinking on this. I will give an example: our whole policy on energy-saving light bulbs. Yes, we want to phase out existing light bulbs, but yet we impose tariffs on the import of energy-saving light bulbs. Yes, we talk about banning mercury in barometers (even though it actually constitutes a very small risk), yet at the same time we are encouraging energy-saving light bulbs which contain, yes, you guessed it, more mercury. Not only that, but we are talking about energy efficiency, yet we continue to come to Strasbourg, which emits tonnes and tonnes of needless extra CO2.</p>

The project provides development opportunities not only for older people but also for the handicapped, women bringing up children at home and people living in rural areas. In my view, this initiative will prevent social stratification in Europe in the area of access to digital services, as well as the marginalisation of social groups threatened by less access to modern technology. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the cost of these technologies must be kept as low as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the report on “enhancing the quality of life of older people”, which deals with issues of major importance for many European citizens, especially the older generation. Older people are dependent on retirement benefits, which are mostly at a very low level. The problem is growing with the increase in the numbers of older people receiving these funds, which are limited since the number of contributors is falling. Thus we are heading for a situation in which a large group of older people will be applying for various social benefits. Many of them, however, are still capable of various kinds of work and can remain active on the labour market. The growing number of older people, plus the need for a wider range of services and products, increases demand in this area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted against, since the report gives rise to a number of doubts. I do not support the provisions of the directive on the harmonisation of excise duty rates on gas oil and petrol. Diversity of excise duty rates creates the possibility of competition among transport firms from different EU countries, which undoubtedly works to the benefit of the consumer. I also oppose the provisions on the increase of excise duty rates on fuel throughout the European Union. High oil prices on national markets and the harmonisation of excise duties in all 27 EU countries will put a brake on economic growth in countries with a low GNP. An increase in fuel prices means an increase in the price of goods and services. I accordingly voted for the amendments tabled to allow the new Member States, including Poland, to retain different excise duty rates.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted against, because the significant increase in excise duty on gas oil will give rise to an increase in customs duty on goods and services in countries which are supposed to charge a rate of excise duty that is lower than the proposed Community minimum but is in any case high with regard to conditions in those countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Given that average income in the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 is relatively low, the proposed increase in excise duty is too great. Its effects will be felt especially by the poorest families, since the present rise in fuel prices already weighs heavily on their domestic budgets. The least developed countries, with their low income levels, should therefore be granted much longer transition periods than those proposed by the European Commission, to give them time to adapt. I consider the proposed increase unjustified and excessive.</p>

      <p sl="en">So here we are, seeing competition as a problem, while at the same time talking about the need for a more competitive economy. This should not be a competence of the EU.

To prove this point today we have a report whose findings are more coherent with somebody who watched too much Prisoner: Cell Block H as a child than on the actual facts of the situation of women in prisons – and whether that should be a competence of this place anyway.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, in recital Q, it says: ‘whereas the increased number of women in prison is partly due to the worsening economic conditions of women’. I think, and I have checked with the statistics from a number of countries in the European Union, the number is going up simply because the population is going up. In fact, the proportion of women in prison across Europe is dropping.</p>
      <p sl="en">It says here that access to health care of all kinds should be provided to a very high quality in prisons. Yes, that is absolutely right. But there are plenty of elderly women in my constituency who would love to have the same benefits of health-care provision that are provided to women inmates in prisons throughout the UK.

Prison officers’ remuneration does not exceed EUR 500 a month. Given the role of prison staff in ensuring that sentences are properly served, it important that most officers dealing with women prisoners should be of the same sex.

      <p sl="pt">In general terms it can be said that the purpose of this report is to encourage the integration of the ‘new’ Member States into EU external policy, particularly ‘development cooperation policy’ and ‘European neighbourhood policy’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report also considers that the ‘new’ Member States represent an opportunity for the EU ‘to reinforce its strategic presence in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus’, regions with which the ‘new’ Member States have priority relationships and which have received less EU ‘aid’ to date.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This means seeking to make use of the privileged relationship of the eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 as an EU intervention instrument (taking into account the interests of the major powers and their large economic and financial groups, particularly in the energy sector) in the countries of the Community of Independent States, the Western Balkans and the Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is, seeking to make use of those countries’ ‘experience’ of ‘transition’ to capitalism and to inclusion in NATO and the EU as a model to be followed in these regions.

      <p sl="fr">I should like to make two comments on the Gill report, which is essentially about organising research programmes with a view to making older people more independent through the use of information and communication technologies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first point is on the substance of the proposals: it is hard to see what added value the European Union would bring to a project initiated, quite legitimately, by a number of Member States – aside from making the process more bureaucratic and setting up a new Community body. The Union’s financial largesse, to the tune of EUR 150 million over a number of years minus the operating costs of the aforesaid new body, does not seem like a clinching argument.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns the form of the proposals. It is increasingly common for legislative reports to be presented in this House in the form of a compromise between Parliament and the Council – the idea being to speed the process by facilitating their adoption at first reading. In effect, however, what we see is the legislative body held hostage by a handful of expert negotiators. I regard the spread of this practice as a threat to democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Population ageing is a challenge to European society and to Europe’s economy. Average life expectancy today is 80 years and the number of people in the 65-80 age bracket will increase by approximately 40% between 2010 and 2030.</p>
      <p sl="fr">New solutions are emerging to help people cope with the memory loss, impaired vision, hearing or mobility and loss of independence which are more likely to afflict us as we age.</p>

The technologies in question can significantly help such people in various situations, including the prolongation of professional and social activity and improvement of the quality of life.

      <p sl="de">I am in favour of cofinancing by the European Union of the ‘Ambient Assisted Living’ programme, since it would benefit not just older people but also other population groups, such as those with disabilities. It is precisely because of the major demographic change in the European population and the rising life expectancy over recent decades that we must support new information and communication technologies that would make it considerably easier for older people to cope with the everyday hurdles facing them. In regard to the general cost reduction in the health sector as a result of the use of these new technologies, I would also draw your attention to the research into ‘mobile health monitoring’ systems, the use of which would reduce annual health costs by EUR 1500 million in Germany alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me underline that one of the benefits of cofinancing is that it would also have a positive impact on the private sector, as it would indirectly assist small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This proposal for a directive seeks to narrow the price differences on fuel among the various Member States that lead to distortions in terms of competition and the environment in road transport activity. The difference in prices of gas oil used as motor fuel and unleaded petrol are indeed significant.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Hence its importance for Portugal, one of the countries in which this situation is making itself felt, bearing in mind the price differences between our country and Spain: Portuguese enterprises suffer competition from Spanish enterprises because the latter benefit from lower fuel prices – fuel representing around 30% of costs – due to lower fuel tax (and VAT).</p>
      <p sl="pt">Portuguese enterprises have justified the stagnation of workers’ fixed wages by this pressure on costs, with serious consequences for the labour force.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Parliament's proposal is more positive because it eliminates the transitional periods under Article 18, a very important aspect in the current situation, in the hope that it will make it possible to reduce the difference between Portugal and Spain in 2010, since the latter will have to increase its fuel tax from EUR 302 to EUR 330 in the case of gas oil. The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015. In the case of unleaded petrol, unfortunately, there will be no change by this means.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Do I need to remind you that measures like this prevent Member States from reducing, for example, VAT in the catering industry, even though that is a sector where the case for distorting cross-border competition is particularly flimsy and where lowering VAT could help to create thousands of jobs?

      <p sl="fr">the other to the Vice-President of Iraq, Tareq al-Hashemi, a member of the Sunni community, who has also denounced terrorist attacks on Christian communities in no uncertain terms and who, following the kidnapping, expressed solidarity with what he called ‘our Christian brothers’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Yet the imperative to export is driven by a divided European industry that is desperate for long production so as to enable it to compete with mass-produced armaments from the US with only batch production domestic demand.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Some Member States have a vested interest in the promotion of arms exports. Hence, if a common code of conduct for arms exports is drawn up, it is likely that certain Member States with a more restrictive policy may be forced to compromise.</p>

Sweden must continue to have the right to pursue a restrictive policy on arms exports if it so wishes.

      <p sl="pt">Not without a certain irony, the resolution itself specifically refers to ‘the evolving European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), in which more and more EU military and civilian missions are being deployed (…) where EU personnel might be threatened with arms previously supplied by EU Member States’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The ‘military equipment market’ is expanding in the EU, ‘several initiatives to harmonise national arms procurement policies and intra-Community arms transfers and sales’ are being encouraged, and there is a ‘willingness to increase arms exports as a tool to promote economic interests’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The watchword has been given: an arms race and the militarisation of international relations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Initiatives and measures seeking at the very least to mitigate such an escalation are therefore positive and necessary.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, will the tragic events that have occurred in Armenia since the presidential election on 19 February 2008 send out the message that Europe is incapable of supporting the fragile little democracies of the South Caucasus in their struggle to become established?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the crisis in Georgia, it is now Armenia’s turn to suffer major political upheaval. Despite the high level of attention directed at the country during the election campaign, the international community failed to promote the dialogue that might have prevented the clashes on 1 March. After 11 days of protest against the election results by the opposition movement under former head of state Levon Ter-Petrosian, police tried to disperse the demonstrators. The situation degenerated, resulting in the deaths of eight people, injuries to many others and the imposition of a state of emergency with curbs on freedom of information and freedom of assembly, as well as restrictions on political parties. Since then, 400 people have been arrested. There is an evident mood of anxiety among the population, who fear that a policy of repression will be imposed. We have a duty today, in our contacts with all the parties involved in the Armenian conflict, to reflect that fear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question, however, is what we should propose as a method of bringing all sides to their senses and getting them to the negotiating table against the current backdrop of heightened tension? That is the challenge. We need to restore the confidence of ordinary Armenian men and women in their fledgling democracy. Essential preconditions for restoring confidence are the setting up of an inquiry into the recent events and the release of those imprisoned. The next step – in conjunction with the international community, our Special Representative to the South Caucasus and our partners in the Council of Europe and the OSCE – must be to fix a timescale for our Armenian friends to return to the negotiating table, and we must bring all the conflicting parties to the table, on both the official and the opposition sides. The rules of democracy depend upon dialogue and non-violence and it is up to us to facilitate such an approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With your permission, Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment. I am not sure how to proceed for the fact is that we made a mistake in the resolution.

Allow me to use this opportunity to thank the Commission’s delegation in Yerevan for all the assistance provided to us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, recent events in Armenia show how difficult it is for fledgling democracies in the former Soviet Union to trust the electoral process. Those who hold power are tempted to stack the cards in their favour, especially in the run-up to elections, whilst those who lose find the results difficult to accept.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problems we have seen in post-election Armenia have been compounded by violent clashes, resulting in eight fatalities, and by the imposition of an extraordinary measure in the form of a state of emergency. Bans on all political activities and strict censorship of the media were imposed on 1 March 2008 for a 20-day period. The ban on political activities has subsequently been lifted. Media freedom, including unrestricted internet access, is to follow. Indeed, all normal constitutional freedoms should be restored next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, it cannot be ruled out that the state of emergency will be extended. For now, a lid has been put on the pressure-cooker. I am concerned about what is being done to release the source of the pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Building democracy is a complex process. It must be safeguarded by institutions in which all parties place their trust. It is, therefore, regrettable that the outgoing President has attacked his country’s human rights ombudsman, who criticised government actions. It is only by strengthening the role of the ombudsman and also by ensuring impartiality of the constitutional court, which investigates allegations of electoral fraud, that democracy can be protected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until there is faith in Armenia’s own guardians of democracy, I strongly urge all parties in the dispute to make use of the mediation offered by the EU and the OSCE envoys and to do so immediately.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in presidential elections we increasingly see continuing uncertainty as to whether the preferred candidate of the ruling government has actually won a true majority of the votes as well as just a large number of votes. Even where that candidate does have a true majority, doubts remain about the size of that majority, certainly where manifest attempts have been made to inflate it artificially.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When, in addition, some candidates are prevented from standing, when only the government-endorsed candidate has access to press, radio and television, when the opposition or foreign observers are not able to monitor the count properly, when peaceful protests against the officially declared results are broken up by army and police and opposition leaders are arrested, there is every reason for very serious doubt that the will of the electorate has been upheld.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have seen controversial presidential elections of this kind outside Europe in Mexico and Kenya, and within Europe in Belarus, Russia, Georgia and Armenia. Even without these elections Armenia was in an extremely difficult position. Traditionally it has strong ties with Russia but is separated from it by neighbouring Georgia, which has a serious conflict with Russia, and neighbouring Azerbaijan, which has for many years had a border dispute with Armenia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When the Russian province of Transcaucasia was divided up along ethnic lines in the 1920s the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by Armenians, was given to Azerbaijan by way of a compromise, with a guarantee of regional Armenian autonomy. That solution is no longer workable in the post-Soviet era, since the two states of Azerbaijan and Armenia are now enemies. In fact the territory is currently occupied by Armenia, and this has led to a protracted conflict with its eastern neighbour, though a ceasefire is in force. This kind of situation, with a permanent threat of war and blockades, provides fertile ground for authoritarian government to flourish and it is unremittingly difficult for democracy to function in the country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The events since the 19 February elections come as no surprise. Even so we must make every effort to get democratic conditions restored and the rights of the opposition reinstated. The wishes of the European Union or its Member States for good relations with the de facto rulers of countries like Russia, Belarus, Georgia or Armenia must take second place behind this prime imperative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Armenia is essentially a relatively recently re-born country, struggling to strengthen its democratic institutions and safeguard the well-being of its citizens whilst squashed between two not-so-democratic but rather hostile neighbours, namely Russia and Turkey, and whilst being disturbingly and unfairly involved in a territorial conflict with the totalitarian regime of Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this setting, the recently-held presidential elections were not perfect, but in the words of the international observation mission, were ‘administered mostly in line with OSCE and Council of Europe [ …] standards’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, in post-election protests it would appear that the police used more than necessary force, which resulted in the death of eight people, including one policeman.</p>
      <p sl="en">A thorough and fair investigation is called for into the events that led to these deaths. An investigation is also warranted into allegations that external forces are instigating violence in Armenia in order to destabilise the country.</p>

May I remind you that the elections in Armenia gave rise to no serious protests. What is happening there today must be seen in the specific context of the Caucasus, a highly inflammable region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">While I have the floor, Mr President, I would, with your permission, take this opportunity to voice my outrage at the news I have just received of the murder of Faraj Rahho, the Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul. He was abducted on 29 February and three of his bodyguards were shot.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is a further attack, a further crime, by men who lack the courage to show their faces to the world, who kidnap innocent victims, ordinary people pursuing religious activities – mostly Christians, mostly Catholic Christians. Today we are again witnesses of such a crime, and it seems to me this matter should be placed on the agenda of our next meeting in Brussels as a special item. May the Lord grant eternal rest to the heroic martyr who died today in Mosul.</p>

      <p sl="ro">What happened in Armenia must be vehemently condemned but unfortunately it was not a surprise. There are other quite similar events in another country in that area and they represent a continuation of the situation in place after 1990.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are facing the consequence of several factors persisting from then to the present day: insufficient economic development, latent conflicts, and the influence of the Russian Federation. On top of all that we have the situation in Kosovo which, despite all considerable but useless efforts of the authors, will form a precedent for all those interested. For the population in the region, it can only result in insecurity, lack of confidence in the authorities, and vulnerability to manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is only one solution to restore a state of normality: economic development that will generate a higher standard of living. There are energy resources. The development of such resources and of their transit will solve the problem of economic development, as well as that of independence from the Russian Federation and it will also solve Europe’s problem in general.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union did not really take a stand and if we want to find solutions to the problems in the Southern Caucasus, the Union must take active steps in the development of energy routes in the Black Sea region.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the present political crisis in Armenia is not the first.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During the presidency of Levon Ter-Petrosian the country began to depart sharply from liberal and democratic standards. The main opposition parties were banned, freedom of the press was restricted, and parliamentary elections were generally recognised as not meeting all democratic criteria. Mr Ter-Petrosian resigned as president under the pressure of demonstrations. That brought some stability to the country, but it was ended by the dramatic murder in parliament of nine leading Armenian politicians, including the prime minister, by unknown assassins.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are now seeing a repeat of what happened some 10 years ago. The present crisis, however, may perhaps be due to the weariness of Armenian society with the governments of the so-called Karabakh Clan, to which both the former and the present president belong. The government is widely accused of restoring authoritarian rule under the guise of democracy, with mafia-type control of business activities and a deteriorating economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is also a growing fear of Armenia’s increasing isolation and the gradual weakening of its position in the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. When Mr Ter-Petrosian decided to return to politics and stand for election, his promise of greater flexibility in foreign policy won him considerable support.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The present crisis is very deep, however. Let us hope it will be resolved by political means, although that is not at all certain. If not, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh may be stepped up in an attempt to unite society around the government. A recent incident in Karabakh in which 11 people died confirms this fear. Another result may be a further strengthening of Armenia’s increasing dependence on Russia. The recent inauguration of the Armenia-Iran pipeline will not weaken that dependence, since the gas, and the pipeline itself, will of course be controlled by Gazprom.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our attitude to the serious situation in Armenia should be friendly, but we should not refrain from criticism or from expressing concern where necessary. I believe the position proposed in this resolution meets those criteria.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the outcome of the presidential election of 19 February 2008 was a factor in the political destabilisation of Armenia, although it should be emphasised that the conduct of the election was recognised by the OCSE as complying with democratic standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The demonstrations following the placing of Levon Ter-Petrosian under house arrest and their brutal repression on 1 March ended with eight people dead, many others injured, and the declaration of a state of emergency. Restrictions on the media and the arrest of more and more members of the opposition are causing serious concern.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We call on the Armenian authorities to restore civil rights without delay, end the state of emergency, respect human rights and determine who was responsible for the tragic events of 1 March 2008.

That is especially important in view of the changes taking place in Armenia since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Governments very often seek to influence the media, but when they resort to violence and the use of force they must be opposed with exceptional determination. And when there are fatal victims, the situation is exceptionally difficult. We categorically demand the restoration of freedom, respect for other views, and the maintenance of democracy and civil rights. We condemn the use of force and the violent dispersal of democratic meetings, protests and demonstrations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission keeps a particularly close watch on the situation with regard to democracy and human rights in Armenia, which, as you know, is one of our partners under the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We follow developments there attentively through the intermediaries of our delegation in Yerevan, with the Member States, and in close cooperation with the European Union Special Representative, Peter Semneby. As part of the process, we are also in regular contact with local and international NGOs working in the fields of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to the tragic events that occurred in Yerevan on 1 March in the aftermath of the election, the Commission shares the general concern over the violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators, which resulted in a number of deaths. The Commission has therefore called for the immediate establishment of a thorough investigation and for the prosecution of persons who broke the law. We have also called on the Armenian Government to lift the state of emergency immediately. The Commission believes it is important that all sides should refrain from using force. We expect all parties in Armenia to commit to political dialogue as the means of overcoming their differences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, the Commission also deplores the shadow cast by the recent events on Armenia’s increasingly positive progress towards implementation of its ENP action plan, particularly in the areas of human rights and democracy. The call to pursue political reform and to respect human rights is an integral element of the partnership between the European Union and Armenia, and the Commission will therefore use every means at its disposal to encourage the Armenian authorities to forge ahead in those areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By adopting the joint EU-Armenia ENP Action Plan in 2006, we acquired a policy tool for promoting the observance of principles based on our shared values. We are firmly convinced that an ongoing dialogue with Armenia, conducted in accordance with the policy provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the ENP Action Plan, is indeed the most effective means of conveying the European Union’s messages about respect for human rights and international law. The annual meetings of the Cooperation Committee and Cooperation Council, and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee are thus particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission also remains determined to contribute to the reform process by providing Armenia with financial and technical assistance. Supporting political reform in the areas of human rights and democracy continues to be a priority in the national indicative programme for 2007-2010. Approximately a third of our bilateral aid – which will amount over that period to EUR 98.4 million – will be used to assist relevant projects. More specifically, the 2007 bilateral aid programme with Armenia is targeting financial support in the field of judicial reform, to the tune of EUR 18 million. I am sure that the European Parliament will back us in that effort and, indeed, will be our staunchest ally.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the run-up to drafting this resolution, some of us were accused of being enemies or opponents of Russia. We are just the opposite! We are friends of Russia, we are concerned about democracy and the rule of law in this important European country. We protest vehemently against the imprisonment of opposition activists who did no more than draw attention to a fact that has been noted by all international institutions, namely that the presidential elections in Russia were extremely unfair.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call for the immediate release of the opposition activists and of others who have been held in prisons and work camps for a long time, like the so-called Yukos prisoners Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and I support Chancellor Merkel’s call for the two men finally to be released.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must, however, be quite clear about one thing. The newly elected President of Russia has the unique opportunity to make a new beginning, to move towards democracy and the rule of law and towards a less nationalistic and aggressive foreign policy. That means, however, that he will have to extricate himself from the coils of Gazprom and free himself from the Putin system; sadly, there is not the least indication of that.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is our duty to voice honest criticisms. It is not those who, like former German Chancellor Schröder, sing the praises of the Putin system and allow themselves to become involved in the propaganda and in the economic and nationalistic interests of that system, who are Russia’s friends; no, Russia’s friends support the human and civil rights of the Russian people, who have a chance of democratic development.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we remain silent, the small seeds of democracy and the rule of law that President Yeltsin sowed and that President Putin has endangered will finally be suffocated, and that cannot be in the interest of Europe or in the interest of the Russian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am talking in a personal capacity on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">In recent years significant changes have been occurring in Russia, from Stalinist Communism to the beginnings of liberal capitalism; from the nuclear threat of the Cold War to the initiation of friendly disarmament and military cooperation talks with the West. At the same time, more democratic reforms in the country have been instituted and the standard of living of the Russian people has been increasing steadily.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome these changes and must support them. We do not always have to be critical of the bad things; we sometimes have to condone and support the good things. In this way, we will not only be objective but we will encourage changes for the better to a faster and greater extent.</p>
      <p sl="en">With these thoughts in mind, and looking at the recent presidential elections in Russia, we have to say that these were held in a more democratic fashion than previously, although there was still the problem of unequal access of candidates to the media. But, let us be honest, is this a problem we do not have ourselves in the EU Member States? Unfortunately, we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the elections, there were protests in the streets. It was reported that some of these protests were met with disproportionate force by the Russian police. Can we honestly say that our own police forces in EU Member States or candidate member states are angels and do not sometimes – more often than we would like – use disproportionate force?</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we condemn the unfair treatment of candidates by the Russian state-run media; yes, we condemn the undue use of force by the Russian police against protesters, but we do so in exactly the same way and with the same spirit as we would when dealing with similar happenings in any other country or union of countries, including our own.</p>

First, that in Russia civil rights are not respected. Second, why persecute the opposition since it is so weak anyway?

The opposition’s access to the media was blocked, and observation of the conduct of the election was impeded.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I want to ask those who today cry over the plight of democracy in Russia whether they are also upset about the European Parliament’s somewhat cowardly refusal to ask how Mr Solana handles international law?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the subject of today’s debate is the infringement of human rights in Russia with regard to people protesting against the lack of democracy, especially during the recent presidential election. Not only was force used against demonstrators, as well as arrests, but the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe had to call off its observation mission because of the excessive restrictions imposed by the Russian Government. The Russian authorities exerted pressure on opposition groups, tolerated electoral fraud and subjugated the media. Non-governmental organisations were prevented from acting and restrictions were placed on the organisation of meetings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We obviously cannot accept the lack of respect for human rights and democracy, the lack of free speech, the discrimination against national minorities and the restrictions on independent organisations. We must however bear in mind that Russia does not have democratic traditions. The short period of democratisation that begin in 1864 ended in 1917 with the establishment of Soviet Russia, a typical totalitarian state, led first by Lenin and Stalin and then by their disciples, that was the very negation of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The situation in Russia should serve as a warning to other empires and totalitarian states that are afraid of the democratic process even when the opposition is a minority and threatens only to reveal the truth, which they want to conceal at all costs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">We know from experience that once economic interests are at stake, whether in China, Russia or Saudi Arabia, the passion for human rights of all these authors of fundamental rights charters must yield to Realpolitik. So let us be under no illusions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, replace 'Russia' in this resolution with 'Belgium' and the text remains every bit as relevant. Because it is not so long ago that in Belgium too, police were incited to beat up peaceful demonstrators on orders from the mayor of Brussels. In Belgium too, the opposition is to a large extent denied access to the media. In Belgium too, politically appointed judges banned an opposition party at the request of the government, at the request too of the party of which the Commissioner, here with us today, is a member. And the judges in question were promoted as a result. Let's see Europe clean up its own act first and deal with these sham democrats.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Russia is a great country, a global player, a member of the UN Security Council and a strategic partner of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would like to appeal for a serious, calm and objective debate in the European Parliament on the plight of Russian democracy and on human rights in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality is that Russia made it difficult for international actors to monitor the last parliamentary election. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled against Russia in 15 cases related to Chechnya to date. Torture and illegal detention by government forces under the leadership of the Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov remain widespread and systematic. In the period leading up to the elections the Russian authorities tightened their grip on freedom of assembly and used excessive force to break up peaceful demonstrations. The Russian laws relating to non-governmental organisations are particularly restrictive.</p>

People in Russia have learned to think proudly but live in miserable servitude. The authorities will not pay too much attention to us, whatever we say, but the Russian people should be made aware of Europe’s position. This is perhaps a long and slow process of contributing to the gradual realisation that, in Russia too, things can be different, more normal, and people happier, since the country has that potential.

I refer to the fact that a number of candidates could not afford to enter the lists because of financial difficulties affecting their parties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Why financial difficulties? Because, in the preceding election to the Duma, political broadcasts made under an entitlement to free air time have to be paid for if the party fails to cross a certain poll threshold. As a result, some parties are in debt and cannot afford any political activity. Worse still, they risk being declared illegal on the grounds of bankruptcy.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to begin with a brief personal comment. I heard the contribution from Mr Dillen, representing a Belgian party of the far right, who indulged in a quite disgraceful comparison between circumstances in Belgium and those in Russia. Obviously I am bound to refute his assertions. I recognise in them the familiar methods to which his party habitually resorts and which merely amount to a form of insult. Let me state very clearly that such methods reflect no credit on those who employ them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is closely following developments in the wake of the demonstrations in Moscow and St Petersburg on 3 March: we are doing so not only via our delegation in Moscow but also through direct contacts with Member States. In addition, we liaise regularly with Russian and international NGOs working in the field of human rights. The Commission shares your concern about the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia and the incidence of reported human rights violations, particularly with regard to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. We were extremely disappointed when the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights was forced to conclude that it was not feasible to send an election observation mission. In its bilateral contacts with Russia, including at the highest level, the European Union regularly underscores the importance of respecting human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a month’s time, we shall have one of our two annual consultations with Russia on the subject of human rights. These consultations give us an opportunity to explore general trends in human rights in greater depth and to hear the Russian point of view on individual cases. In the forthcoming consultation we will convey our concerns, particularly about the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the problems posed by the rise of racism and xenophobia, and cooperation with Russia in international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The consultations also enable us to raise the cases of individuals. Before and after this consultation, we will meet a group representing Russian and international NGOs which work for human rights. Such meetings put the European Union in touch with the concerns of human rights activists and enable us to exchange views directly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking somewhat further ahead, we should soon be in a position to embark on negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation. It will be a comprehensive agreement, embracing the growing number of policy areas in which we cooperate. As the European Union statement following the Russian presidential election pointed out, we have a common interest in furthering our ties and we hope that our partnership will be consolidated and developed constructively under the presidency of Dmitri Medvedev. We will take care, when negotiating the new agreement, to ensure that it reflects the values to which both sides have committed themselves: a thriving civil society and independent media are the natural and necessary allies of growth and stability in Russia. We have learned this from our own experience in the European Union and it is a message that we shall doggedly continue – as neighbours and partners – to convey to our Russian friends both on a day-to-day basis and in discussions about the shape of our future relations. I know already that the European Parliament will lend us its unstinting support in these efforts.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am always amazed at people who make high demands on American democracy but often have very low expectations of Russia. That is humiliating for Russia and the Russians. From the great and powerful one should expect more, not less. Those who condemn the methods applied in Guantanamo and the fight against terrorism, who look for the footprints of the CIA and CIA conspiracies in Europe, ought perhaps to scrutinise Russia more thoroughly. But such people, and the politicians who share their philosophy, do not want to hear about human and civil rights in Russia. On the contrary, they find all sorts of reasons and excuses for not discussing the problems of Russian democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We cannot be content with Russia's imagined achievements, such as the fact that President Putin did not breach the Russian constitution and left office of his own accord. That is no achievement, it is a minimum rule of conduct. I am reminded of a joke about Stalin's benevolence. A child comes out of Stalin's office, bleeding but smiling. ‘What are you smiling about?’ someone asks. ‘I’m smiling because Stalin was so good to me.’ ‘What do you mean, good?’ the questioner replies. ‘He beat you didn’t he?’ ‘Yes,’ says the child, ‘but he could have killed me.’</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will link this discussion to the previous debate on Russia because I strongly believe that, if we believe in a core set of values, we cannot uphold them only in countries that are weak, and give countries that are strong an exemption.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am proud that this Parliament debated the resolution on Russia, and we should all be proud of that. We should fear the day when the European Parliament stops debating these resolutions and stops standing firmly for the values that we believe in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because, today, democracy is not the right of everyone to be equal, it is the equal right of everyone to be different. This is a core message that we need to pass on to our partners in Russia, and we need to pass it to our partners in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Karzai and the Afghan Government have committed themselves to building a democratic, modern state. In a democratic and modern state, the death sentence is unacceptable. There is not debate about that. No form of death punishment is acceptable in a democratic and modern state. This is the core of our European value.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case of the Afghan journalist Mr Kambakhsh is even more perplexing, because he has been sentenced to death because of exercising his right to free access to information.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should encourage very strongly the authorities in Afghanistan, the Government and the President to intervene on his behalf and use their powers to spare his life and to make sure that he is pardoned at the end of the process which he needs to go through now, meaning the appeal process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should, however, also continue to help the authorities build the institutions that they need to function as a democratic and modern state, support civil society and, most important of all, continue our commitment to the security of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we should never forget that education is the core value that we need to impress on a country like Afghanistan. Girls have been able to go to school only in the last few years. There is so much work for us to do there. We should not shy away from that work, and we should impress very strongly, both on the Commission and the Council and all the Member States, the fact that we should invest in education in Afghanistan.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Afghan journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh has been sentenced to death. As usual, authoritarian governments are attacking those who speak out on human rights, and hence journalists and religious activists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with previous speakers that we should not be more indulgent towards powerful countries like Russia and China. As Mr Mladenov quite rightly said, the standards should be the same for all. I would also point out that those who say we should be more indulgent towards China or Russia because they are powerful states are wrong on two accounts. First, because the standards must be the same. Secondly, because the fact that governments have to make certain compromises is a different matter. In the history of Europe, parliaments have always been the conscience of the nation. And parliaments cannot make such compromises as we unfortunately must sometimes accept on the part of governments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Capital punishment is barbaric and freedom of expression is set in stone in Afghanistan's constitution. And yet the journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh has been sentenced to death for blasphemy, far from the capital Kabul, because of an article on women's rights under Islam which he did not even write himself. His brother writes critically about local leaders, so clearly that was not helpful to Perwiz's case.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This death sentence came as an enormous shock, even in countries with a large Muslim population. Journalists in Pakistan, in Iran, in Qatar, everyone is painfully aware of the importance of safeguarding freedom of expression everywhere, worldwide. In the teeth of considerable opposition, in spite of ultraconservative clubs that hold no brief for freedoms, women's rights or open debate. Even though those conservatives need freedom of expression too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What should Europe do?</p>
      <p sl="nl">1. Offer more help than was promised in 2007 for reform of the judiciary in Afghanistan;</p>
      <p sl="nl">2. Appeal forcefully to President Karzai to take action and support him on this;</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, some believe that Afghanistan is a country which in recent years has been in a state of continuous turmoil and chaotic tension. Poverty, illiteracy, tribal violent rivalry, drug barons, warlords, Russian occupation, Taliban terrorism, followed by formidable US-UK military intervention, and on top of all this, strict Islamic sharia law. If ever there was to be hell on earth, Afghanistan would be a very strong candidate indeed. Yet, in the face of this extreme adversity, there are weak acts of defiance, and hope for freedom of speech and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such is the case concerning a young journalist, Perwez Kambakhsh, who dared to circulate an article about women’s rights in Islam, which he had downloaded from the internet. This brave act was considered blasphemy in accordance with Palaeolithic-era sharia law and he was sentenced to death by hemi-encephalic fanatically blinded so-called judges in a so-called regional court in northern Afghanistan. As we all know, women in fanatic Islam terms are regarded as little more than pieces of furniture and any attempt to dispute this is met with extreme action, such as the one under consideration in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">But things have to change for the better and we in the West have a duty to see that such a change happens sooner rather than later. Since the West, including the EU, has a formidable military presence in Afghanistan and since the West, including the EU, pours billions of euros in financial aid into that country, I think we are perfectly correct in demanding that not only the young man in question be immediately and unconditionally released, but that similar occurrences in relation to backward Islamic sharia law do not occur again – ever! Otherwise we should seriously consider pulling both our troops and our money out of Afghanistan and letting that country follow the hellish course that it will be sentenced to by its fanatic religious destiny.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group strongly supports the motion for a resolution concerning Mr Kambakhsh, although I am not sure I would agree with everything the previous speaker has said.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I want to shift attention to another young man whose life is also in danger at the moment, Mehdi Kazemi, who is from Iran, and where the British Government, in this case, could make a difference. Many of us hope that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will now intervene on the basis of new evidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament has passed many motions for resolutions which have condemned the human rights record in Iran. We believe that it is a dangerous country for homosexuals. Indeed, we have seen the bodies hanging from cranes, so we know that it is, and many of us believe that it is dangerous for this young man in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are those who have said that it is safe for him to be returned if his behaviour is discreet. I would suggest that what constitutes ‘discreet’ behaviour in Iran is rather different from what that might mean in our own Member States. But the issue is that for many, in certain countries, whether they are in Iran, Jamaica or elsewhere, being gay is a crime and they are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group has been very critical of the Dublin Regulation which is involved in this case, because we know there are still very large variations in the way in which asylum requests are treated between Member States, and that even access to the procedure can be extremely difficult. We have seen a climate where numbers have been regarded as more important than life.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the substance of a protection procedure: it is about saving somebody’s life when it is at risk. It is not about the niceties of correct procedures: it is about the effect.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, let me first make two brief observations. To begin with, we can never, ever stay silent when the death penalty is applied, irrespective of where in the world it happens. Secondly, it is deeply regrettable that, every time we meet here in Strasbourg, we have a number of crimes against human rights on the table. Sometimes it feels as though it will never end.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In relation to this resolution, we note that Article 34 of the Afghan Constitution very clearly enunciates the right to freedom of expression, stipulating that freedom of expression must not be restricted and that every Afghan must have the right to express his ideas in speech, image and the written word and through any other medium. Despite this, the 23-year-old journalist, Perwiz Kambakhsh, has been sentenced to death in an unlawful trial, and his legal rights are being denied him. The trial is closed to journalists and organisations working for human rights. The so-called crime was that he had disseminated an article on the situation of women under Islam.</p>
      <p sl="sv">So the background is well known. We now emphatically demand that Perwiz Kambakhsh be released immediately. He has not done anything criminal whatsoever; he has acted entirely in accordance with the law and the Constitution. The EU and the entire world must now rally behind this demand: free Perwiz Kambakhsh.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of Mehdi Kazemi we are having to discuss something that really should not require a single second of debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">If anyone was asked whether they thought it possible for a European country to consign someone into the hands of an executioner and a dictatorship such as Iran, the answer would undoubtedly be that it was unimaginable. However, the unimaginable may well happen, and is about to happen, despite the reassurances that are being given. That means that something very serious is happening, that Europe is being gripped by a kind of madness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some say that there are various legal quibbles that may bring about Mehdi Kazemi’s deportation and death. That simply must not be possible. The founding principles of the European Union, of respect for human rights and life, have not yet been abolished. If Mr Kazemi is put to death, no one will really be able to shift the blame onto bureaucratic procedures, unless they resign themselves to the view that that is solely what Europe is about: bureaucratic procedures, nation states which are so powerful that they cannot even manage to save a life.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would thank the 140 MEPs who have rallied round this cause and I hope that this House will vote unanimously for the resolution that has been tabled.</p>

The trial took place without any right of defence. The accused was beaten and a confession extracted by brutal treatment.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, a few months ago the Iranian President, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, solemnly declared to the United Nations that there was no problem of homosexuality in Iran because, quite simply, there were no homosexuals there. What he failed to say was that they execute any homosexuals there are there.</p>
      <p sl="es">The case of Mehdi Kazemi highlights once again the huge loopholes in the European Union asylum system: the fact that someone must seek asylum these days on the ground that he or she is being persecuted and threatened with death because of being a homosexual is a matter of utmost concern and shows that the promotion of LGBT rights must be moved up the international agenda.</p>
      <p sl="es">More serious still is the fact that the European Union, the champion of rights and freedoms, does not consider persecution on grounds of sexual orientation a sufficiently important factor for automatically granting asylum in cases such as that of Mehdi Kazemi. Unfortunately, this is not the first case of this type, and it will undoubtedly not be the last. The fact is that there are still many countries where the LGBT population continues to suffer persecution of all kinds and are even condemned to death, as in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore hope that this House and all the political groups are aware of the circumstances and will join in the just petitions made in the resolution we are submitting today, especially in relation to full implementation of the Qualification Directive, which recognises persecution on grounds of sexual orientation as a determining factor in the granting of asylum. Similarly, it provides for Member States to consider cases on an individual basis, taking into account the circumstances in the country of origin, including its laws and regulations and the manner in which they are applied.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also necessary for the Member States to find a common solution which ensures that Mehdi Kazemi is granted refugee status and the protection he needs within the European Union and that he will not be returned to Iran where he will very probably be executed as his partner was.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end all that needs to be done is to comply with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights under which expulsion and extradition of persons to countries where there is a high risk of their being subjected to persecution, torture or even the death penalty, is prohibited.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support both these resolutions. But it is my country that is proposing to send a young teenage man home to his death in Iran. A death already suffered by his friend. Not for any crime, but because of his sexuality. It is my country which in the past has had the proud boast that it has an absolute standard that we never send people back to face a penalty worse than they would suffer if they were facing a penalty in Britain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here we have no crime and we have a penalty which we in Britain abolished many years ago. It is my country which, if it does not relent in this case, should hang its head in shame. I hope that this Parliament will not have to hang its head in shame. I hope they will support this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the values of the European Union is to coordinate action and adopt positions in defence of human rights. That applies to the case of an Afghan journalist sentenced to death by a court in a northern Afghanistan province for distributing an article on women’s rights in Islam. During his trial he was refused the right to defending counsel and was subjected to various forms of physical violence. Yet the Afghan constitution contains a clause on the right to freedom of speech.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we see, law and reality do not coincide. Many governments guarantee respect for the Declaration of Human Rights but shut their eyes to the way it is applied in their own countries. That should make us even more determined to defend human rights, freedom and democracy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to stress that, despite my Group’s concerns, to some extent founded, that some of the content of the resolution may be put to wider use, there is no getting away from the fact that the information we are receiving from Iranian sources and authorities is unambiguous. Mehdi Kazemi’s fate, if he returns to Iran, is death and it is for that reason that I shall depart from the norm and vote in a different way to my Group.</p>

    <intervention id="4-237" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving us this opportunity to talk with you about the cases of Perwiz Kambakhsh in Afghanistan and the Iranian citizen Mehdi Kazemi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to Mr Kambakhsh, we obviously share all your concerns and we are following the case closely on the ground through our delegation to Afghanistan in cooperation with the head of mission and the EU Special Representative. We have raised the case repeatedly with the Afghan authorities, most recently with the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Spanta, at the troïka meeting in Ljubljana on 21 February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I know that the European Parliament’s Afghanistan delegation also raised the issue directly with the Afghan Parliament and that the Afghan MPs gave you an assurance that a satisfactory solution would be found.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe we should continue to take the approach followed thus far, relying at least for now on discreet diplomatic activity. Judging by the current political climate in Afghanistan, it will be harder to secure Mr Kambakhsh’s safe release if it appears that the Afghan authorities are bowing to international pressure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to assure you, however, that we shall continue to follow this case very closely and that we shall be ready to take further steps in the event of the death sentence being confirmed on appeal. Almost 30 years of armed conflict have wrecked Afghanistan’s judicial system. We have therefore made reform of the country’s judicial institutions a priority in our programme of aid to Afghanistan. We already have experts working there with the Supreme Court, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Ministry of Justice, with a view to professionalising those institutions at both central and provincial level. The European Commission programme will also help the authorities to put in place a new legal-aid system – something that is sorely needed in Afghanistan, as this case has shown. There is currently no firmly established, independent Bar and no access to public legal aid. I am very hopeful that the Commission’s judicial reform programme – being implemented in close cooperation with the EUPOL Afghanistan police mission deployed under the ESDP – will help to improve the human rights situation in the medium and long term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, the Commission also shares your deep concern about Mehdi Kazemi and other similar cases. The Dutch and British authorities are currently considering Mr Kazemi’s case very carefully. With regard to the protection of refugees, we would point out that international law stipulates, notably in the Geneva Convention in relation to the status of refugees, that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under the Iranian criminal code the act known as lavat is punishable by death. However, the term lavat makes no distinction between sexual relations freely entered into and forced sexual relations. In the latter case it would seem that, where the penalty is pronounced for lavat in conjunction with other offences, the term normally denotes rape. It goes without saying that the Commission is categorically opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, and all the more so where no crime has been committed. The situation of homosexuals in Iran is a cause for concern. Violations of the right to private life and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation are entirely at odds with Iran’s obligations under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it has ratified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union conveys these messages about human rights to Iran in a general way and also through action on a number of fronts. Unfortunately, Iran has not yet accepted our offer to resume bilateral dialogue about human rights. Nonetheless, in our discussions with Iranian representatives, we emphasise that we wish to see progress on all the issues of concern to the European Union in the fields of politics, nuclear policy, trade and human rights. Without general improvement in the human rights situation there, our relations with Iran cannot develop satisfactorily.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On a personal note, I should like to extend my own warmest thanks and congratulations to Mr Bowis on his contribution: I fully share the sentiments he expressed.</p>

      <p sl="it">The item on Mehdi Kazemi has been included among the items on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. While it is not a resolution on asylum policy, the Bureau nevertheless decided to include this item under urgent resolutions.

He said the UK would not hand him over. That is why I propose to my Group that we should not vote against, as we originally intended, but should abstain and that in future we should look at cases of this kind in more detail in this House.
