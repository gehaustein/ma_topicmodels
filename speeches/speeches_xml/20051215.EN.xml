      <p sl="unknown">Written Declaration No 52/2005, by David Martin, Neil Parish, Peter Skinner, Terence Wynn and Robert Evans, on rising international concern over the farming of bear bile in China, has been signed by the majority of Members of this Parliament. In accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to the institutions named therein and will be published, indicating the names of the signatories, together with the texts approved on 17 January 2006.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise on behalf of all the authors to thank everybody in this Chamber who has signed this declaration. It has received cross-party, cross-nationality support and it will now go forward to the Commission and the Council. I think it is something the Chinese Government will really take notice of, because I believe bear farming in China must be brought to an end. I thank everybody for their support and I hope this will go forward with great vigour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to wish you all a happy Christmas.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am asking for the floor under Rule 145 on personal statements, which allows me to speak for up to three minutes; I will not take that much time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the verbatim report of Tuesday’s part-session has only just been made available to us, and it has brought to my attention a personal attack made against me by a man who, until then, I had believed was presiding over the sitting courteously and impartially. I am referring to the vice-president of the sitting in question, who saw fit to interrupt me and to take sides regarding the background to my dispute with the French Government. His reference to a historical fact – the tragedy of the Struthof camp – even shows that he is completely ignorant of the ins and outs of this tragedy, and of the most recent work of historians on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The president of the sitting also saw fit to make a comment following one of my colleagues’ speeches, even though it contained no personal attacks and no insulting comments. In all of my considerable parliamentary experience, I have never seen a sitting president act as arrogantly as Mr McMillan Scott and I find it deeply regrettable.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is customary at the start of the vote, the general rapporteur presents some technical corrections. As I do not wish to break with this tradition this year either, allow me to outline some such technical corrections.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like, however, to begin by expressing my thanks, because this job has been difficult but, at the same time, extremely satisfying. I therefore take this opportunity to warmly thank all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets, its chairman Mr Lewandowski, the political groups’ coordinators and staff, and the Secretariat and all its members, above all the administrator who made certain that I received the constant, loyal and expert assistance of Richard Wester, assistance that tied in well with the meticulous expertise of my assistant, Annalisa Gliubizzi.</p>
      <p sl="it">My thanks go to all of you too, beginning with Mr Borrell, who closely followed all the stages of the procedure, and in addition, of course, to all my fellow Members, who made their own contributions via ideas and proposals, and who I hope today will also use their vote to contribute to a positive outcome, honouring me with their trust.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, this truly represents a positive outcome, a sign of a trend that is being reversed, the credit for which goes to all the institutions, but – and I say this with a real sense of pride – above all to our Parliament. I hope that this outcome opens the minds of those who still do not wish to recognise how costly a non-Europe would be.</p>
      <p sl="it">The technical tasks to be performed are as follows: firstly, following the adoption or imminent approval of a number of legal bases, we should release the appropriations placed in reserve for a series of budget lines. I should like to make it clear that this is only technically possible for those budget lines on which an amendment tabled by Parliament already existed. Where that is not the case, we call on the Commission to put forward a proposal for a virement as soon as possible. The lines in question are 02 01 04 04; 04 01 04 05; 04 05 01; 04 05 02; 04 05 03; 09 03 01; 11 07 01; and 24 02 02.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, the section of Amendment 209 relating to line 19 08 02 01 – on the MEDA Programme – is approved in the sum of EUR 25 056 550. This amendment is covered by the vote on Block 1.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following these technical corrections, I propose we proceed to the vote and I also take this opportunity to give you all my best and warmest wishes for the festive period.</p>

I also have one technical correction, which concerns Amendment 193 of Part 11, in connection with the European Court of Justice. Due to technical problems the notes are missing there, but the text of the note is as follows: ‘A 3.6 per cent reduction has been made in this part in connection with staff posts: five new staff posts in the IT sector (four B3 posts and one C1 post) and 16 staff posts for Romania and Bulgaria (ten A7 posts, two B3 posts and four C1 posts)’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to begin by apologising to Parliament for arriving here late this morning. The reason for this is simply that I was told there was an entirely different timescale. Because of that I arrived at what I thought to be on time, so I genuinely apologise to all Members of Parliament for that misunderstanding. Certainly, had I been aware of the correct timing, I would have made sure, as a matter of courtesy to Parliament, that I arrived on time. So I genuinely apologise for that misunderstanding.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Development had adopted this amendment unanimously and I am very grateful to the members of that committee for their clear-sightedness and their support. The Council, however, has refused to accept even the slightest gesture towards the ACP countries, despite the position and positive actions taken by the UK Presidency, to which I can bear witness. The Commission, for its part, was not willing to budge an inch. The system, blocked due to this Parliament’s budgetary debate, did the rest and dealt the final blow. However, for pressing schedule reasons, Mr President, this regulation absolutely must be adopted at first reading. We have therefore accepted our responsibilities and withdrawn Amendment 9, which was calling for EUR 80 million.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I am forced, for the reasons I have just outlined, to ask you to vote on this report, and to do so in line with your votes on the budget. However, in order to send a message to the ACP countries that some of us here have not forgotten them, I request that my name be deleted from the text, and I have a proposal for my fellow members of the Committee on Development, and for them alone: make a final, symbolic gesture by voting ‘no’.</p>

The EU budget must primarily be used to create full employment in Europe and to help bring about sustainable social, economic and environmental development. We particularly welcome the fact that our repeated demands for investment in the Lisbon Strategy, including more money for student exchange programmes and for the EU’s research and development programme, have been listened to. The payments in the agricultural category are lower than those originally proposed, and we think that this is fair. There is too much in the way of direct agricultural aid, and this leads to inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and widens the gap between rich and poor in the world.

      <p sl="pt">I shall use this explanation of vote as a way of reflecting on the negotiations and agreements on Community budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">1. There have until now been more contradictions than anything else in the Council. Running scared, the political forces and major economic interests at the root of so-called ‘European integration’ sound their warnings of the consequences of disagreement between the so-called ‘powerhouses’ of the EU. A second crisis, following the resounding ‘no’ votes delivered by the French and Dutch people to the so-called ‘European Constitution’, would intensify the feeling that the path that they tell us is the only one to follow lacks ‘credibility’. This is why they are calling for ‘agendas’ to be harmonised, not least at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">2. It does not matter how much Parliament glosses over its complicity in the systematic reduction in the Community budget in recent years – surely this reflects the commitments made by the right-wing and social-democrat forces in the Commission, the Council and in every EU Member State – but the (cold) figures are there for all to see. Overlooking its previous proposals, and throwing consistency out of the window, Parliament’s proposal for 2006 is virtually equivalent to what the Luxembourg Presidency proposed for 2007-2013. Experience has taught us that this story is far from over; after all, Parliament has a habit of lauding today what it found unacceptable yesterday.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Unlike the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective, the EU’s budget for 2006 gives Parliament some cause for satisfaction.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By keeping payment appropriations at 1.01% of EU GNI, Parliament has achieved a slight increase on last year’s figure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The real plus point here, however, and the reason for my full support, has been the increased funding made available for a range of programmes that impact directly on the lives of Europe’s citizens, such as LIFE and SOCRATES.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A further reason to be pleased was the increased budget for initiatives in the area of research and support for SMEs, which are crucial if we are to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As for structural actions, I agree with the idea of not raising the amount of future funding to the new Member States until there has been an improvement in the rate of use of the current funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, by adopting this 2006 budget, Parliament will be sending out a highly symbolic message for the ongoing debate on the next financial perspective 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the perspective is not adopted before the end of the British Presidency, it will be the 2006 budget that will act as the basis for negotiations on the next annual budget, using the so-called ‘duodecimal’ system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Disabled persons and persons whose mobility is restricted due to disability or other conditions, such as old age, still have the same rights as other citizens. This also holds true when they travel by air. Blind and deaf and dumb people should be included in this group too, since they need appropriate access to information when they travel. It would be wrong to ask disabled air passengers to pay additional charges. A proposal should be made to include these costs in the general expenses of the individual carriers. After all, we are not talking about huge sums of money.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There should be a guarantee that the needs of disabled persons will be met throughout the EU, regardless of which airline or airport they use, and assistance should be provided at each stage of their journey. Examples of such assistance include help when moving around the terminal, boarding or leaving the plane, collecting luggage or transferring to other flights, and the provision of a wheelchair with an attendant at the check-in counter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It would be advisable to ask carriers to install appropriate devices that make it easier for disabled persons to board and leave planes. Designers of passenger planes should also ensure that features such as gangway width and toilet size are tailored to the needs of persons with restricted mobility.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On top of this, a uniform EU-wide system must be put in place for the provision of assistance to disabled air passengers. This should include the development of service standards that are mandatory in all Community airports.</p>

The fisheries policy also has devastating global consequences. The fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries generate short-term income for the countries concluding the agreements. In the longer term, the agreements lead, however, to the depletion of fish stocks and make it difficult for local fishing industries to develop. Only a limited amount of the compensation paid out goes to the local population. The agreements should be paid for by those countries or fleets that choose to make use of these agreements. The fisheries agreements should not be concluded at all within the framework of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report contains a positive amendment to the effect that the financial contributions should also be used for the development of coastal populations dependent on fisheries for their living (Amendment 2). The report as a whole emphasises, however, that the agreements are of benefit both to the EU and to third countries. We do not share this view and have thus voted against what is being proposed on this matter. The position that we are expressing through this explanation of vote constitutes the attitude that we have adopted on principle where this issue is concerned. The explanation of vote will thus apply to future matters of a similar kind.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We voted in favour of the Fisheries Protocol because it guarantees fishing opportunities for the various fleets of the Member States operating in Seychelles waters until 17 January 2011, including five Portuguese surface longliners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The renewal of this protocol is an important factor in guaranteeing the survival of Member States’ surface longliner fishing, a section of the fleet that has been severely affected by the crisis in the fisheries sector in recent years. A case in point is Portugal, where the number of vessels has dwindled year on year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, even taking account of the fact that this new Protocol will last for six years, and bearing in mind the take-up levels of the fishing opportunities on offer, we must highlight the reduction in the number of surface longliners and the increased cost of licences, which we feel is unjustified. This will lead to higher equipment costs and thus a loss of income. It should be highlighted that there is a proposal to increase the cost of licences to EUR 1 000 for surface longliners over 150 grt and to EUR 750 for surface longliners less than 150 grt.</p>

We need to ensure that EU decision making is logical, the Common Fisheries Policy is not and puts those of us who are pro-European in the unenviable position of having to explain such an illogical and disastrous policy to our increasingly rightly sceptical electorate.</p>

We therefore feel it is only right that the new Member States should fully enjoy the same support for their activities and that high levels of consumer protection should be promoted in all EU Member States. This is especially important in the new Member States in view of the amount of deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation that their economies have undergone in the so-called transition process to market economics and now that they have joined the Union there are hardly any consumer protection bodies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That being said, we do not share the rapporteur’s underlying philosophy regarding the concept of ‘consumer’ and consumer protection, from the perspective of completing the internal market, promoting the entrepreneurial spirit, and attempting to create a ‘consumer’ culture in those countries via a market economy approach. Such a philosophy severs the cultural roots that were in place before the transition, when a person’s value was not measured by their capacity for consumption.

      <p sl="pt">More and more facts are coming to light about the US security services and agencies, such as the CIA, illegally kidnapping people, flying them to Europe, detaining them and then subjecting them to isolation and torture. These disgraceful and unlawful acts, which violate the most basic rights, deserve forthright condemnation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is especially worthy of condemnation because, contrary to what some would have you believe, this is not some isolated incident or a series of unsubstantiated allegations. Quite the opposite, the reports emerging of this appalling state of affairs are merely the tip of the iceberg of US imperialism, which, under the cloak of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, rides roughshod over the United Nations Charter and international law, and uses the UN for its own ends.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although it likes to play with words, the US administration has never denied the existence of the flights, the kidnappings or the illegal prisons.</p>

Agreements on secret service cooperation and on the unlimited transfer of information classified secret are part of the “Berlin plus agreement”, which allows the EU to take military action using NATO capacities. In February 2003, there was agreed directly with the USA a close cooperation in the transport of suspects.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group has serious concerns about human rights in China. We have regular reports of the continued use of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons with reports of the use of torture. Those concerns are particularly true in Tibet, where we continue to receive many reports of violations in particular against Buddhist monks and people who follow the Buddhist faith.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for Hong Kong, we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory. I would note, however, that in far too many countries in the world the demonstration on 4 December of tens of thousands of people in favour of such universal suffrage would not have been permitted.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we have a problem. Paragraph 14 of the resolution – on which we have asked for a split vote – invites the Dalai Lama to address Parliament in what would be seen as his capacity as a head of state. I do not believe it is our place to make such a momentous change to our one-China policy in the middle of an urgency debate. I personally have met and talked to the Dalai Lama on two occasions. I have no objection to his being invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs or anywhere else. However, I and the PSE Group will not be able to support this resolution if that paragraph remains in place.</p>

      <p sl="de">Again and again, we come up against the problem that the Dalai Lama is treated as a separatist, even though he has always explicitly supported the ‘one China’ policy, does not support any secessionist movements, and even though his own requests for negotiations on autonomy are couched in the most pacific terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point I would like to make is that monasteries are now being used as places where pressure is exerted not only on monks, but also on the general population, in an attempt to re-educate them, and it is because this sort of thing is unacceptable under any circumstances that I ask you to vote in favour of this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, two months ago we adopted an urgent resolution in this House regarding Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and he still has not been released from detention. Once again we are here, this time to seek to highlight the ‘patriotic education’ campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries. Last month five Tibetan monks were arrested in Drepung Monastery. We hear they have also been tortured in detention. But what is their crime? Their crime is that they refused to sign declarations denouncing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public education began as a tool of repression in 1996 in China, but it has escalated since 2005. The Chinese Government is attempting to brainwash the people. This is not public education, it is a suppression of human rights. No doubt the Chinese will again say this is an internal matter for China, but the international community cannot sit idly by when peace-loving people are subjected to this kind of treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan monk Ngawang Jangchub, who died in October during a ‘patriotic education’ session. The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights. If it does not, the least we should do – and I mean the least we should do – is maintain our EU embargo on trade in arms. Unlike one of the previous speakers, I would like to see the Dalai Lama coming here and addressing Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it was at the beginning of October that the 28-year old monk Ngawang Jangchub died in his cell in the Drepung monastery. His death resulted from his interrogation by cadres of the campaign for so-called ‘patriotic education’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The object of this is that critics of the regime should be brought back into line by means of drastic physical and mental re-education measures. Over 10 000 monks and nuns in Tibet have been obliged to undergo brainwashing since 1996, something that constitutes a flagrant breach of freedom of opinion and religion. The intention is that threats, periods of detention, and torture should induce the inhabitants of monasteries to denounce the Dalai Lama, in writing as an enemy of the state and a separatist. Mrs Lynn has already described how, on 23 November, Chinese security forces occupied the Drepung monastery near the capital, Lhasa. When they arrested five senior monastics, 400 monks mounted a peaceful demonstration for their release. The police and special units responded promptly to this by sealing the monastery off from the outside world for days on end. Are human rights resolutions adopted by this House a matter of indifference to the Chinese? It is evidently not enough for them that the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, and the Council should intervene. Or are they no more than footnotes to the loudly-heralded dialogue between the EU and China? Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me remind the House of our debate in October, on which occasion we demanded, as a matter of urgency, an improvement in the conditions under which the highly regarded Lama Tensin Delek Rinpoche were being held, which were putting his life at risk, in order to make it possible for him to receive a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="de">The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, has just published the results of his inspection of Chinese prisons, labour camps and police stations. He confirms that torture is taking place, and that prisoners and persons regarded as suspect are being mistreated. The effect of the Chinese system of re-education through work is that people can be sent, without a court having passed sentence upon them, to a camp for up to three years. That is a manifest offence against their personal integrity and against the dignity of every human being.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in October 2005 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Chinese authorities’ unjust imprisonment of the Lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche. This resolution achieved nothing, however, as Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is still being detained and tortured, in spite of his poor state of health. It merely demonstrated the extent to which human rights are violated in China.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Chinese authorities are currently implementing a policy of ‘patriotic education’, and forcing Tibetans to sign declarations in which they reject the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and acknowledge that Tibet is part of China. Anyone who refuses to sign such a declaration is threatened with persecution and arrest. As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly, Tibetan monks are at particular risk. These extraordinary ‘patriotic education’ sessions have already resulted in the death of one monk in unknown circumstances and the arrest of five others. What is more, the 7 000-strong Drepung Monastery has been occupied by the Chinese Special Forces since 25 November, and hence completely cut off from the outside world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the situation in Tibet, it is clear that the international community must continue to exert pressure on China to improve the conditions in which prisoners are held and to abolish the use of torture and the death penalty. In addition, the Tibetan people must be supported in their fight for life and a continued national identity. It is also worth mentioning in passing that only a dozen or so of the over 3 000 Buddhist monasteries that were once found in Tibet are still in existence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the hope that we will finally achieve our goal by adopting yet another resolution, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the Chinese authorities put an immediate stop to such blatant violations of civil liberties.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, due to time constraints I will make only one comment, a self-critical one, with regard to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800 Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing. To be fair, however, such a system is arguably better than the previous system whereby the ex-British colony was administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England. I cannot recall the European Parliament passing any resolutions at that time condemning Britain for imposing such an undemocratic system on the people of Hong Kong. Then again, what right does this House have, even today, to criticise British colonial policies? It dared not do so in the past, and I expect it would not dare do so now concerning Britain’s occupation of approximately 300 square kilometres of Cyprus as a colony, where thousands of Cypriot civilians are governed by an administrator appointed by the Queen of England.</p>
      <p sl="de">Before I become too controversial for my honourable British colleagues, let me finish by saying that in this resolution we call for the setting of a timetable for the election of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive by universal suffrage.

I consider the Dalai Lama to be a tremendously honourable man and I would be very honoured if he were to come to speak in this House.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More seriously, faced with a dictatorial regime which restricts, imprisons, tortures and kills its people, how can we express our indignation beyond our little debate this afternoon? Given that, in 30 months’ time, the world’s young people will gather in Beijing for the Olympic Games and that the Chinese Government intends to take advantage of this event to celebrate its pseudo-democratic model, I would modestly suggest that we should allow our athletes to bear a message of peace, democracy and freedom so that they can be the champions of the Tibetan cause, otherwise we will do a great disservice to everyone in that part of the world.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the British colonial government did not leave behind a parliamentary democratic structure in Hong Kong but, rather, created the expectation that the People’s Republic of China would introduce that system over there. When Hong Kong was handed back to China, the formula of two systems in one country was devised. People laboured under the illusion that, for Hong Kong, this would mean that, unlike in the rest of China, a parliamentary democracy on the basis of universal suffrage and a multi-party system could exist. It was thought that it could thus be a trial area for future developments in the rest of China.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We now know what those two systems come down to: capitalism under the control of the governing party in the largest part of China, and capitalism without that control in Hong Kong. There is a lack of democracy in both cases. The situation in Hong Kong, where a small selected group has been given the responsibility of self-government, is of course preferable by far to the situation in Tibet, where violence, intimidation and re-education are the instruments employed by the central authority.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate on violations of human rights centres on Tibet. On 23 November, officials from the Public Security Bureau closed one of the oldest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on the orders of the Chinese authorities. They arrested one of the most senior monks, and four others whose fate is unknown. A policy of ‘patriotic education’, which amounts to indoctrination, has been introduced in the country in order to boost support for the Chinese Government among the Tibetan monks, and to combat the influence of the exiled Dalai Lama. Tibet has been brutally occupied by China since 1950. The Tibetans have not given up their peaceful fight for freedom, however, even though at least one fifth of the country’s inhabitants have died of hunger, been tortured to death or been executed. Nearly all of the country’s monasteries, which once numbered over 6 500, are in ruins.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Holy Father John Paul II reminded us that the seeds of destabilisation, rebellion and violence are inevitably sown when human rights are neglected or even abused. There is an urgent need to restore people’s awareness of the dignity of every human being, made in the image and likeness of God, so that it can be used as a sound foundation for freedom, justice and peace on earth.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Government of the People’s Republic of China, however, even imposes strict controls on religious practices and places of worship. It limits the number of monks and uses exile as a punishment, especially for anyone who is not suitably submissive. Yet notwithstanding the massive scale of the tragedy in Tibet, it is worth noting that the problem of human rights violations, which is an issue that has already been raised in this Chamber, affects the Chinese nation as a whole. The people of China have been repressed for years, and all manifestations of civil independence in the country are stifled. There is detailed documentary evidence of the methods and instruments used to inflict torture on prisoners and of the brutal treatment they receive, even if they have merely voiced their discontent. Such practices are proof of the cruel barbarity that prevails there.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The situation in China in recent times can be described as a highly explosive mixture of Communism and capitalism. The laws of economics have become the only driving force behind development in the country, and there is no longer any place for human rights or moral standards. While it may well be the case that those in power are responsible for human rights violations in individual countries, we should not forget that the moral relativism of the Western world is also partly responsible. Adamant claims are made that this latter promotes human rights, and yet companies from more or less every country in the world find it hard to resist the huge consumer market and the cheap workforce, especially in the ‘reeducation through work’ camps. The prospect of enormous profits helps them to shut their eyes to the tragic situation of prisoners, and to the fact that the materialistic civilisation that is emerging is heading for disaster, at the same time creating poverty and hell on earth for some and paradise for the rich.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are therefore calling for the international community to stop treating China as if it were a giant labour camp and a cheap workforce, and for human rights to be respected not only in Tibet and Hong Kong, but throughout China.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, one of the problems in connection with the persistent violations of human rights in Communist China is the lack of credible, consistent and firm protest from the European Union. We are always paying lip service to human rights, but we do not act on the basis of what we say. The European Union and most Member States are more interested in China’s economic potential than in having human rights respected.</p>

It supports early and substantial progress towards the ultimate goal of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, as set out in the basic law, in line with the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. It is important that we maintain pressure on China to work towards universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the situation in Tibet, the European Union has put Tibet very high on its agenda with China. It has, in particular, mainly focused its attention on the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. The present situation in the region, which we follow very closely, raises grave concern, especially with respect to the exercise of religious freedom. We are worried to see that the local authorities have imposed a strict framework setting limits on the exercise of this freedom, and we deplore the recent cases of detention of monks and, in particular, the blockade of the monastery of Drepung in Lhasa.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope that a solution compatible with both Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon. In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative but a peaceful process based on dialogue. We have called for years, and will continue to call, for the establishment of such a dialogue. We, therefore, fully support the process which has been taking place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.</p>
      <p sl="en">We firmly believe that only such a direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue. In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be made subject to any precondition. On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of the climate of confidence that appears indispensable, if a solution is to be reached.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for having made it possible for us to arrive at a joint resolution on the position of NGOs in the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Consensus is also important because that way it is easier for us to influence the decision-makers in Russia. As now these are particularly urgent matters, we Social Democrats wanted just to focus on this issue covered in the statement. The issue is also an urgent one for the Duma, which will return to the matter in five days’ time.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the next parliamentary sitting we will be debating the resolution on Chechnya. We fully agree with Russia’s human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin that the draft law goes against Russia’s own constitution. It also goes against international law. I hope that Lukin’s opinion carries weight, because he has chaired the European Parliament-Duma joint delegation for many years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The freedom of NGOs to operate is an essential part of democracy and stable civil society, which the Russian leadership had said it supports. As a member of the Council of Europe, Russia has committed itself to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and, for example, its plans to restrict freedom of association conflicts with that totally. Parliament is worried about recent developments in Russia, and now the Duma has an excellent opportunity to contribute to the development of democracy. It can show that changes can be made. Obviously we hope that that will be the case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is alarming to observe the changes in Russian society, with the grossest human rights abuses exemplified by the new law intended to make NGOs dependent on the state, the ongoing repressive measures directed against the former Yukos bosses Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, and by the state of war in Chechnya.</p>
      <p sl="de">Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are being held, contrary to Russian law, in prison camps in Siberia, a long way from Moscow and north of the Arctic Circle, in temperatures of - 50°. Lebedev is seriously ill. Contact with their family members and lawyers has been made extremely difficult; they have no access to information and are not allowed newspapers. Their defence counsel, Yevgeni Baro and Yuri Schmit, are themselves facing trial next week on a charge of defamation. The Russian justice system’s denial of human rights is made all the worse by the ever-tighter restrictions placed on the freedom of the press. We should be clear in our own minds as to what is going on here and call upon the Council and the Commission to use their influence on Russia to get human rights respected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is only true and fair to say that in recent years, Russia has, overall, made significant progress towards the respect of human rights, and this we must praise. Unfortunately, there are still a number of areas where progress is much needed in this vast country, with its very long and unique history and culture, and it must be encouraged to proceed with the outstanding issues, where reform is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such an issue is that of NGO legislation. It is a well accepted fact that NGOs and non-profit-making organisations are often key to developing a strong and well functioning civil society. Such organisations, ranging from children's charities to consumer groups, are not present in very large numbers in Russia. It is, of course, a fact that Russia has suffered severely from terrorism in the last few years and public sentiment, expressed through elected representatives, may, when dealing with certain NGOs, especially those in Chechnya, border on the extreme and tend to be unduly legalistic and severe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although this may be understandable under certain circumstances, it is not acceptable in terms of proper respect of human rights. We therefore call on the Russian Duma to listen to our advice and take the necessary time to review and impose the amendments concerned with the legislation, in the light of the recommendations expressed in the Presidential review, the Council of Europe provisional opinion and this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, for years, the point was driven home in Western Europe that Russia was undemocratic and that a very great deal needed to change there, and, indeed, sweeping changes have taken place in Russia over the past 14 years. Its economy now resembles America’s to a greater degree. The discrepancies between rich and poor that have come about as a result are now more pronounced than in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the areas of democracy and human rights, the situation is certainly no better than it was in the final years of the Soviet Union under Mr Gorbachev’s leadership, and the oppression in Chechnya outstrips the crimes of Stalin. Where democracy and human rights are concerned, Russia is continuing a bad tradition. It is not so much Russia that has changed, as the perception of that nation in the countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Before, we in Western Europe saw the East, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, as an economic rival and military opponent. These days, we consider Russia to be an ally and supplier of energy. According to the former German Chancellor, who is now on Russia’s payroll, Russia now boasts a flawless democracy. In those circumstances, it hardly comes as a surprise that there is increasingly less room for independent television stations and that freedom of association and assembly is being curbed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The citizens are given less and less opportunity to get involved in government policy. The return to a blemished past is hastened by a law that places non-commercial organisations of citizens under government control and that has the power to suspend their funding and to dissolve them. This House therefore has every reason to endorse the criticism made by the Council of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Russia remains the largest country in the world and because it is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE it is under greater scrutiny and criticism by the EU in terms of fundamental democratic rights. It currently enjoys privileges, such as the PCA Agreement, a strategic partnership based on the Four Common Spaces Agreement, and eventual ENPI and EIB funding benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia continues to be a democracy, albeit an imperfect one. However, for some time now, concerns have been expressed that the Kremlin and the siloviki, so-called men of power close to President Putin, have been attempting to restrict freedom of the media and NGOs, in particular, where it was felt that they were interfering with Russian strategic interests, such as the bloody conflict in Chechnya, or the strategy of reversing some of the controversial sell-offs of the oil and gas sector in the early 1990s in order to increase the patronage of the state.</p>
      <p sl="en">A handful of men, such as Khodorkovsky, benefited enormously. He was convicted of several criminal offences and had his extensive Yukos holdings renationalised. His controversial trial followed with accusations internationally of political manipulation of the judicial system. More recently, on 23 November, the Duma approved the law restricting freedom of association and the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in Russia by imposing fiscal and residency requirements of registration, which the Council of Europe, in a provisional opinion, has seriously questioned as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, much to his credit, President Putin has listened to the objections and asked to rewrite aspects of the bill which infringe fundamental human rights and which are not legitimately necessary to fight terrorism, as was mentioned in Chechnya in particular, and money laundering.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope reason prevails. We all wish to see a democratic, European Russia with whom we can all share fundamental common values of basic human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution, especially Recital I and paragraphs 8 to 13, which take the broader view of the issue that Mr Horáček and I wanted to see. It is often the case in these debates that we take up the cudgels against small-time dictators and neglect to address the human rights situation in major states that are of strategic and economic importance to us. I am glad that we are, today, spelling out how things stand in China and Russia, for if we do not, we run the risk of our economic dependency on them – for it is a regrettable fact that we are economically dependent on them in some areas – causing us to take a one-sided view of human rights or making us blind to the issues at stake.</p>
      <p sl="de">For years on end, the German Government minimised the importance of such things as the war in Chechnya or the smothering of human rights in Russia, or even passed over them in silence, and when you see the position that the former German Chancellor, Mr Schröder, has now taken on, you can quickly understand why they did so. We must take care that Gasprom, the partly state-owned Russian energy giant, does not start to play the sort of role once played by the United Fruit Company in Latin America. While we must cooperate economically and politically, we must not mince words when telling what is really going on as regards human rights. I am thinking here not only of the prisoners languishing under unspeakable conditions in Siberia, about whom Mr Horáček has had something to say, but also of the attempt at silencing independent organisations – NGOs, in other words – as successfully as the Russian media already have been. I am very much obliged to Mr Deß for seeing to it that we end up using more renewable energies, for Europe’s dependency on Russian energy is bringing us to the point where we start keeping our mouths shut about things that must not be hushed up.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to draw the House’s attention to a dangerous trend in Russia. The public prosecutor’s office and the judiciary in this country are increasingly being used as political weapons by President Putin’s regime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On 9 December 2005, the Russian public prosecutor’s office charged the Neftyanoi Bank with money-laundering and tax fraud. The Bank’s director, Boris Nemtsov, is one of Russia’s most able liberal politicians, and a key member of the anti-Putin opposition. This is particularly significant in view of the forthcoming presidential elections, which will be held in 2008 and which will determine the future of democracy in Russia. In a statement given to my party’s headquarters for its November 2005 newsletter, Mr Nemtsov said that there was a risk that a state-controlled and monopolistic capitalism could be established in Russia. He also expressed his belief that the country is currently undergoing a process of, and I quote, ‘Lukashenkisation’.</p>

Except in Russia, where people or groups, business people and journalists that are too critical of the Kremlin’s and Putin’s policy are gagged. To top it all, the Russian authorities now also intend to silence domestic and foreign NGOs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am delighted that six of the eight groups have managed to table a joint resolution that will allow us to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. It will give people like Mrs Alexejeva and Mr Gari Kasparov a shot in the arm and will also give a boost to the many who are active in NGOs, like Mr Nikitin at Bellona, and to NGOs like Immemorial, Greenpeace, Social Verdict and the Civil Society Contact Group.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, democracy and freedom are under threat in Russia. This is the main thrust of the resolution, which is a response to new rules according to which it will no longer be possible in future to bring any amount of money into the country provided that it is used to support the development of civil society. The second reason for the resolution is the influence exerted by the government over the majority of media outlets.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Duma will soon adopt a similar resolution on the European Union. Freedom, and consequently democracy, are after all also under threat here following the adoption of a proposal for the mandatory retention of telephone calls, text messages and emails for the police. In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi controls a decisive share of the television market, and indeed of the media market in general. Foreign owners clearly dominate the media in the Czech Republic, where 80% of the press is in the hands of two German groups. This constitutes a clear threat to the freedom of information, and the situation is similar in Poland and the Balkan States. Is no one in the House concerned in the slightest by this state of affairs? It is my belief that this House will unanimously reject this motion for a resolution once it has given a small amount of thought to the matter. If it does not, our electorate’s opinion of us will be far from flattering.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is a shame that we are discussing human rights violations in Russia on a Thursday afternoon. This is particularly regrettable as we spent a great deal of time debating Tunisia on Wednesday, when all the Members of the House and the media were present.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Freedom of speech and thought is one of the European Union’s fundamental values, and it is the cornerstone of democracy. This is reflected in the activities of the hundreds of thousands of NGOs that constitute the third most powerful and influential force in Europe. Yet it is an unfortunate fact that laws are being adopted in Russia which are alien and incomprehensible to us in Europe. Russia is moving ever further away from democratic standards, and we cannot stand idly by and watch fundamental rights being denied in a country that has a privileged relationship with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We cannot remain indifferent in the face of changes that are so blatantly undemocratic. Russian NGOs will find it more difficult or even impossible to obtain foreign funding. The new restrictions will apply to as many as 450 000 organisations in Russia, including foreign and international organisations operating in the Russian Federation. The new law prohibits the activities carried out in line with the rules previously in force by Russian branches and representations of foreign and international organisations. What this means is that they will have to shut down their current branches, and submit applications to set up new organisations that will be independent of the parent NGOs. Foreigners who do not have permanent residency in Russia will lose the right to form civil organisations, as well as the right to sit on the boards or be members of such organisations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Certain Russian politicians have claimed that NGOs are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia, but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy. The European Union should make known its strong opposition to such a reprehensible attitude, which is symptomatic of the increase in xenophobia among Russia’s political elite. The existence of 450 000 NGOs in Russia, and the fact that they are so active, testify to the popularity of this aspect of public and social life in Russia. The European Union should support this manifestation of civil society.</p>

Here is a concrete example: the widely known and regular violation of human rights in Belarus and Russia. Russia, furthermore, is engaged in the genocide of a nation, which is something that is not happening even in Belarus. Nevertheless, the Council and the Commission treat the two States completely differently. The doors to European Union States have been slammed in Lukashenka’s face, yet President Putin is welcomed with open arms. If these double standards are only being applied because of Russia’s oil and gas, resources that Belarus does not have, then such a policy is immoral, although the European Union is supposed to be the standard-bearer of human rights, as well as moral policy. I do not believe that the Council and the Commission are unaware of the principles of moral policy; however, these principles should not be sold for oil and gas.</p>

There is, at the moment, no independent judiciary, there is no free television, and the political opposition has been totally marginalised.

Old habits die very hard in the Soviet Union, but we have to help Russia to come back towards democracy and universal values. First of all, it is in the interests of the Russian people: they deserve liberty, democracy and transparent governance. We also cannot work with a partner who does not adhere to international rules. We have to help Russia become a confident nation which sees that there is no conflict between strength and a democratic, thriving civil society.

      <p sl="mt">Thank you Mr President. It is an undeniable fact that organisations known as NGOs and MPOs have a vital role in our civil society, both in large countries such as Russia, as well as in small countries such as where I come from. In Russia, the number of the many organisations which exist is around seventy thousand. Less than three weeks ago the parliament known as the State Duma passed some amendments, through the first reading, which had an impact on these organisations. One must appreciate the thought both within Russia as well as outside Russia about these amendments which can have an impact on human rights. However, one must mention that in certain countries there was a small number of these organisations which were abused for illicit and illegal aims. On the other hand, the amendments proposed by Russia have a negative impact on those organisations known as ‘buona fide’. On a positive note, the Council of Europe was asked for guidance and even the President of this country, Putin, made some proposals to the new chairman. To conclude, I would like to say that the solution is not to place these organisations in the same category, but to have the necessary legal tools within the parameters of the European Convention so that those which are not genuine will be identified.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commission’s view on human rights in Russia. There are a number of issues which give us cause for concern and which we raise regularly with Russia within the framework of the existing strategic partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me begin with Chechnya. We were glad that the elections took place there on 27 November, and that they took place without violence. Given the troubled history of this region that in itself is an achievement. We hope they will be a step in the process towards peaceful democracy there. However, there are a number of reports of irregularities, and we expect that these will be properly investigated.</p>
      <p sl="en">But much more needs to be done if Chechnya is to progress to democratic stability. Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation, a culture of impunity remains. It is essential that the authorities fully investigate cases of disappearances and allegations of torture and bring the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, to justice. Russia should also implement its expressed willingness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Rapporteurs. It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya is seen to be carrying out his duties impartially and effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also express our concern at the evidence of continuing harassment of NGOs including those receiving support from the European Community, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod. This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that context, I should draw attention to the proposal for amending Russian legislation on NGOs which is currently before the Duma. We have been concerned that it could make the operations of many NGOs, especially foreign ones, more difficult, and could therefore potentially jeopardise the Commission’s efforts to help build up civil society in Russia, as well as our humanitarian aid programme in Chechnya. The amendments have been presented as necessary to enforce Russia’s right to protect itself from terrorism. Of course, we respect that right, but action taken must be proportionate and must respect international commitments regarding civil society, notably those relating to the OSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner raised these concerns with Foreign Minister Lavrov during the Russian Government’s visit to Brussels on 7 December. He expressed understanding and said that amendments would be made to the bill to address these issues. We were, therefore, pleased to note that changes to the draft law have now been sent from the presidential administration to the Duma and welcome the prior consultations held with the Council of Europe on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we remain concerned that the present draft law could still lead to constraints on the legitimate activities of NGOs. We urge the Russian Parliament, therefore, to use the second reading on 21 December to take the Council of Europe’s opinion fully into account. We will continue to follow this matter closely, including the implementation of any new law adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me say that we want to address these issues in a spirit of cooperation with Russia. The EU-Russia human rights consultations, which began this year, are now a regular feature of our dialogue and provide an opportunity for frank and open exchanges. In addition the Commission, as well as being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the North Caucasus through ECHO, has agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socio-economic recovery there – a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region. We will continue to take all opportunities to contribute constructively to that process.</p>

They felt that the electoral process had been set up by the regime not to achieve democracy but to fool the international community. Despite being elected by the Ethiopian people, they are now in jail. They have been on hunger strike since 28 November, face a possible death penalty, and yet are neglected by European leaders. This is in spite of the fact that, in early September, I warned European governments, the Commission, the US Government and the UN Secretary-General that the regime might be planning the selective repression of Ethiopian opposition leaders.</p>
      <p sl="en">How could European governments fail so miserably those who trusted the European Union, those who fought and continue to fight for democracy in Ethiopia? How could European and American leaders fail so miserably the Ethiopian people and such an important country: the second most populous in Africa and the headquarters of the African Union? What message are they sending to all Africans? How can the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council continue to turn a blind eye to massive human rights violations inside Ethiopia, forgetting how this could lead to another devastating war with neighbouring Eritrea? How can Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council, continue to allow in his Commission for Africa Mr Meles Zenawi, who is keeping imprisoned and threatening with the death penalty the elected opposition leaders, journalists, human rights and development campaigners and even the Ethiopian representatives of the Global Call to Action against Poverty?</p>

Secondly, it must be ensured that humanitarian aid, which is still so necessary to the population, is channelled via NGOs and the United Nations and, thirdly, that the maintaining of the arms embargos on the region is guaranteed, as well as strict compliance with the code of conduct on arms exports.</p>

If it is fundamentally the case that, despite past animosity, there is now the will for peace on both sides, could the Commission and Council not play a more active role in bringing the two sides together?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the situation inside Ethiopia, the Council will be aware that a cross-party group of us who observed the 15 May elections wrote to Hilary Benn, the British Secretary of State for International Development, on 23 November. We detailed our concern at the loss of life and the human rights abuses which have taken place there since June. I am told that an answer is awaiting the Minister’s signature.</p>
      <p sl="en">This may be the political equivalent of a cheque in the post, but I understand that the Council and Commission are committed to pursing a robust discussion on democracy and human rights issues under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. I hope it will indeed be robust and that the option of initiating urgent consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement will be borne in mind if progress is not forthcoming.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I should like to ask the Commissioner, in connection with the resolution on the situation in Ethiopia, whether the European Commission, or any other aid donor, has suspended aid to Eritrea following the latter’s flight ban on UN helicopters monitoring the situation on the border between the two countries. This ban is a gross violation of the terms of the truce, and it would only be sensible to take clear action on this matter. I realise that Ethiopia, all valid criticism notwithstanding, has made more progress towards what we call democracy than its rival in East Africa, but I cannot help but wonder why the authors of this resolution have not called for talks to be held with the descendants of the dynasty that previously ruled the country, and for the restitution of the property of this dynasty and of the old hereditary aristocracy. It would be only logical to do so, in view of the fact that we have adopted resolutions today calling for the future EU Member States to make such restitution.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Today we have adopted resolutions that call for restitution, but I would ask whether this is not a clear-cut case of double standards. We are unyielding in our calls for restitution only where Bulgaria and Romania are concerned. We do not make similar calls in the case of Ethiopia, since it would be all too obvious that they are pointless. I support the resolutions, but I am astonished that neither the current head of the Imperial Family of Ethiopia or even President Putin will be asked to appear before the European Parliament, even though His Holiness the Dalai Lama was called on to do so in the resolution on Tibet. I am sure that it is only me that thinks that the European Parliament may well be applying double standards. Incidentally, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission’s response is to the recent adoption by members of the Australian Parliament of a law which curtails civil liberties and which, inter alia, allows people to be detained for 14 days.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, if you look hard enough on the map of the Horn of Africa, you find a little island of stability called Djibouti. All around it, the situation is precarious. Somalia scarcely exists as a state any more; the domestic situation in Eritrea is highly critical, with the opposition suppressed, and in Ethiopia, the situation after the elections is exactly as the EU’s principal observer, Mrs Gomes, has described it. Not only that, but Ethiopia is subject to the destabilising influence of Eritrea, which we know to be supporting guerrillas fighting in Ogaden, and the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia is still threatening to erupt into open warfare.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, here in this House, we are focusing on the domestic situation in post-election Ethiopia, and so the demand we have to make is no vague one: we must call upon the government to desist from deploying disproportionate force to suppress the opposition and the general population, and must release all political prisoners and journalists without delay. I heard recently that three more had been arrested, so the most up-to-date state of affairs is that 15 journalists are in custody. The International Red Cross must also be given access to the camps in which so very many people are being held. The country’s prime minister has again said that he will not only put the political leaders on trial, but also the 3 000 other detainees with them, and that there would be no mercy whatever – not even a Christmas amnesty. As the Ethiopian Government is quite clearly bent upon confrontation, we call on the European Union to give thought to the possibility of imposing – as we already do against other regimes – targeted sanctions against those in power in Ethiopia, which would, I believe, send out a clear signal. If these people are no longer permitted to travel to Europe on shopping trips, perhaps it will also dawn on them that they can no longer count on our support, and that we have no confidence that they are leading their country in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the fact that we, in this House, are already adopting the third resolution on Ethiopia in less than half a year shows how grave and disturbing the situation in that country is.</p>
      <p sl="de">Heartening though it is that the Ethiopian authorities have set 8 000 people at liberty, the figure does demonstrate that mass arrests have taken place, while the government has hitherto always declined to make known either the total number of persons actually detained or the locations at which they were being held. Our resolution therefore demands that the Ethiopian Government give information as to the total number of persons detained and the places where they are being held, allow access to them by the International Committee of the Red Cross and their families, and ensure that they get legal advice and medical care.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, human rights violations in Ethiopia are not a new thing. Nor is condemnation of these violations new. Twice in 2005 this Parliament passed resolutions on the situation in Ethiopia, and twice we were disappointed by the response. Recently the Ethiopian ruling regime undertook an alarmingly gigantic crack-down operation against political leaders, human rights defenders, independent journalists, NGO workers and young people voicing opposition to the government in Addis Abba. Thousands of civilians have been arrested and detained without trial. About 8 000 have now been released, but an unknown number still remain in custody.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are also most concerned about troop movements on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean sides of the border. The fear of a new war is now real and the devastating hostilities of the recent past may once again become a nightmare reality of the present.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call on the Ethiopian Government to respect the human rights of its citizens and we also call on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Governments to show restraint, abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and, in the spirit of good faith, resolve their border differences peacefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will conclude by saying that what we heard from Mrs Gomes was most disturbing and serious and I hope the Commission will be able to give answers to the questions she posed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, yet again we turn our attention to Ethiopia and yet again the situation has not improved and if anything got worse. Reports get worse and worse. We now hear that some eighteen thousand youths have been arrested in Addis Ababa and have been taken to an open field by the Dedesa River and imprisoned. It will need to be a very big field.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Ethiopian authorities must be put under strong pressure by us to reveal how many of their citizens they are mistreating. This motion for a resolution has a number of ideas as to how, but I would be grateful for your update, Mr Commissioner, on what your plans are and what action you will be taking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government must disclose how many, particularly how many young people, have been imprisoned and how many killed. Also, what is the Commission's view of the prospective establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into this whole business?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although I hope our wishes for a joyful Christmas will also reach the people of Ethiopia, I believe that the holiday season will be a sad time for many of them. I say this because a not insignificant number of Ethiopians are Christian, and Ethiopia, which is one of the two largest countries in Africa, has Christian roots. As I see it, this is a further reason why the many EU Member States that share these Christian roots should defend human rights in Ethiopia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I trust the Commissioner will not act like a certain African bird today. I refer to the ostrich, which is known for its habit of burying its head in the sand. I hope that Mr Verheugen will speak boldly about the will and determination of the European Commission and of the EU authorities to stand up for human rights in a country in which such rights are indeed being violated, whatever anyone may say.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the internal political developments in Ethiopia since the elections on 15 May. The democratisation process has come to a difficult crossroads.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission condemns the killings of innocent civilians by the security forces on the streets of Addis Ababa and in other cities of the country in July and November. The arrest of thousands of people for sympathising with the opposition parties is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also condemns the arrest of opposition leaders who have completed three weeks of hunger strike, putting their lives in danger.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s concern has been expressed in writing by Commissioner Louis Michel, as well as in Addis Ababa by the European Union and United States' ambassadors, and by the Donor Ambassadors Group. The Ethiopian authorities have been duly notified of our concerns but have not yet reacted in a constructive manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">As an immediate reaction to the events, the Commission and other donors have agreed to reconsider the implementation of development aid. Budget support is already delayed, whereas humanitarian aid, food aid and other programmes continue at present.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the political front, the European Union Heads of Mission will launch a structured political dialogue with the Ethiopian Government, according to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Heads of Mission in Addis Ababa have proposed to the government a detailed structure for the dialogue and performance indicators to measure progress on the political and human rights situations. These indicators mainly relate to progress in the democratisation process, the respect for human rights and the rule of law, as well as issues of regional peace and stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage, the Commission does not consider that consultations, as foreseen in Article 96, should be opened because there is still hope that political dialogue can achieve positive results.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the longer term, the Commission will need to work on the strengthening of democratic institutions in Ethiopia and the promotion of open dialogue between the government and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, the Commission is promoting the advocacy role of Ethiopian civil society with the aim of enabling them to play a stronger role in the democratisation process. In our view, these efforts must be continued, despite setbacks to the democratisation process.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Ethiopia/Eritrea peace process I would like to recall the European Union position on this matter. The European Union encourages the parties to abide by the Algiers Peace Agreement, as well as by the final and binding decision of April 2002 of the Ethiopia/Eritrea Boundary Commission. Eritrea and Ethiopia should respect and implement UN Security Council Resolution 1640(2005). Furthermore, the initiative is with the United Nations Security Council because the United Nations is the guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and can enforce international law.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am concerned about the deteriorating situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea which threatens to lead to a new war. It took the Eritreans decades and the deaths of tens of thousands of freedom fighters to achieve independence. Since then the human rights situation in Ethiopia has remained dire, while in Eritrea it has deteriorated from adequate to very poor.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless the shadow of conflict hanging over the region makes it even more difficult to see human rights significantly improve in either country. Therefore it is important that the Commission and Council press both countries to return to the troop deployment levels of 16 December 2004, and for Eritrea in particular to reverse its decision to ban helicopter flights by the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea and to ask some members of the Mission to leave.</p>
