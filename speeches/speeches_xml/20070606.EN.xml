      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy for me to be able to welcome today 18 fellow Members from Bulgaria – the first directly elected MEPS – to this House, and thus into our midst.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The citizens of Bulgaria went to the polls on 20 May 2007 and elected their representatives to the European Parliament in a democratic process. This was an important day for Bulgaria, which joined the European Union on 1 January. It completes Bulgaria’s integration into the European family after the fall of communism.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It took over 60 years for Bulgaria to be restored to a free Europe and for our continent to be reunited. Bulgaria’s culture is an ancient one, and the country is situated at a crossing point between East and West. It is claimed to be the site of one of the oldest countries in Europe, founded in 681. Bulgaria is the country of Orpheus and Eurydice, the home of the Thracians and of Dionysus. It brings with it a rich cultural and intellectual heritage, and will thus contribute to the mutual enrichment of the European Union and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Particular thanks are due to Bulgaria, and especially its people, for their efforts over recent years and the willingness to undertake reforms. Great progress has been made, and many reforms were accomplished in a relatively short period of time. It is now up to our new fellow Members to help ensure that the reforms that remain necessary are implemented with the same determination.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I wish you a speedy, successful integration into the work of the European Parliament so that, with your work and efforts, you are able to make a constructive contribution for the benefit of your voters and of Europe. You will be the voice of Bulgarian citizens in the European Parliament, and will represent their interests. Let us work together on the further development of our European community!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, in agreement with the chairmen of the groups and the whole of the European Parliament – and seeing Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in our midst – I should like to make the following statement on behalf of this House.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The terrorist organisation ETA has declared the ‘ceasefire’ announced on 22 March 2006 at an end. I should like to express my solidarity with the entire Spanish nation and its democratic institutions in these difficult times. Parliament firmly condemns the use of violence as a means to any end. Today, more than ever, Parliament appeals to all Member States to be determined in their support for the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism. This is a fight that can only be carried out on the basis of the rule of law, with the full force of the law and strong democratic institutions.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We remember the victims of terrorism at this time, with whom we stand in sympathy and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to address a very brief request to you as President of this House. I should like you to ask the Mayor of Moscow, Mr Luzhkov, for clarification on the treatment of two MEPs – Mr Cappato and myself; a member of the German Bundestag, Mr Volker Beck, and a member of the Italian Parliament, Ms Vladimir Luxuria, on 27 May.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the occasion of a peaceful action for equal rights for gay people, we wanted to hand over a letter to the Mayor of Moscow signed by nearly 50 Members of this House. Mr Cappato, Mr Beck and an ALDE Group official were violently attacked by hooligans and then arrested by the Russian police. Two of the Russian activists who were arrested are here today – Mr Nikolaj Aleksejev and Mr Nikolaj Khramov. The police equally failed to protect Ms Luxuria and myself from an angry crowd and the police stood by watching as other activists were beaten up by thugs, skinheads and even priests.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Members of Parliament not engaged in any illegal activity, we would expect the Russian authorities to protect us against violent criminals, and certainly not to arrest us on dubious grounds. Freedom of assembly is a basic human right that must be observed by Russia as well, being a Member of the Council of Europe and present at the G8 Summit today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I trust you will ask Mr Luzhkov and Mr Putin for an explanation on the way that Members of this House were treated.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0197/2007) by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the roadmap for the Union’s Constitutional Process (2007/2087(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-020" speaker_id="1352" name="Enrique Barón Crespo" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to present the joint report drawn up by Mr Brok and myself, two MEPs from different countries, belonging to different political groups, but expressing this Parliament’s repeated will for the Constitutional Treaty to move ahead and enhance our European Union significantly immediately after the Berlin Declaration marking its 50th anniversary.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we say essentially is that, for the first time, in a public debate and in a joint fashion, we have drawn up the Constitutional Treaty that was signed in Rome in October 2004. At the moment, that Treaty has been ratified by two-thirds of the States – 18 States – four more have stated that they wish to ratify it, two States have held referendums that have rejected it and three have yet to issue their opinion on it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we must continue our work following the period of reflection. Our proposal is essentially that we support the German Presidency’s efforts to call an Intergovernmental Conference at the next European Council, with a clear and precise mandate, which, on the basis of the current Treaties, of the Constitutional Treaty, can seek an agreement so that we can continue to work together.</p>
      <p sl="es">We, who have been committed from the outset, believe that the Constitutional Treaty is made up of two parts: one which consists of Parts I and II, or Part IV, which is the result of the work of the Convention; and then Part III, which incorporates and reworks the current Treaties and increases the number of legal bases for codecision from thirty-six to eighty-seven, something which is important to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, we believe that a formula can be achieved that enables us genuinely to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, bearing in mind that the period of reflection has been fruitful and that we are not living in a hermetically-sealed box, but rather in the real world, there are a series of issues that are current, such as climate change, solidarity on energy, immigration, the adaptation of our social model to an ageing population and globalisation, the fight against international terrorism, the dialogue amongst civilisations and strengthening economic governance in the euro zone, which can enable us to enrich and respond to the concerns of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is essentially the message that we are proposing. Furthermore, we believe – and this is a clear message to the Council – that, following the Convention, Europe's future cannot be debated behind closed doors.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have already taken the step of holding a political debate.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen – and I hope that the President will defend us, as he has always done in this field – we are asking to be able to participate actively in the Intergovernmental Conference and we are proposing formulae for providing precise information on what the Council, the Commission – which we hope will be very active – and also the governments are proposing and thinking with a view to moving forward. At the moment, Mr President, we believe that the important thing is not just to send a message of hope, but also to state that, as an old proverb puts it, ‘the path is made walking’, and that we must continue to move forward jointly, because that is what our public opinion demands, because that is what we have agreed and because it is also our duty, not just for ourselves, but for the rest of humanity as well, since we in Europe are currently building the first supranational democracy based on States and citizens, which has provided us Europeans with peace and prosperity — and we celebrated that in March — but it must also enable us to be a pioneering political organisation in democratic terms, which is looking towards the future of humanity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-021" speaker_id="1263" name="Elmar Brok" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for me to repeat what Mr Barón Crespo has said, as I agree with every word.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the Berlin Declaration also states, thanks to the European Union, Europe – the western part, to begin with – has experienced the most peaceful, free, social and economically successful period in the whole history of this continent. Following the events of 1989 and the EU enlargements of 2004 and 2007, we have the great opportunity of securing this for the rest of the continent, too. This Constitutional Treaty aims to ensure that the Union of 27 can also enjoy these achievements. This success story must not be endangered. The 27 countries must be capable of action and be on an equal footing, and we should avoid Europe disintegrating again into various groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">This must also be viewed in the light of the challenges we face, challenges that none of our nation-states can meet alone: such as globalisation and its economic and social consequences, the fight against terrorism, and the development of our foreign and security policy. We know that energy, and thus energy security, is not now within the area of authority of the EU, but we also know that the security of all our Member States is at stake and that we must therefore be capable of action in this field. The issue of the Minister for Foreign Affairs should also be addressed. We need a treaty organisation that, via a single legal personality, gives us the ability to act externally, too. Consequently, such matters concerning the substance of the Constitutional Treaty are vital if we are not only to prevent all war in Europe, as we have in the past, but also, in the interests of our citizens and nations, to increase our capacity for action in areas where nation-states alone cannot do any better.</p>
      <p sl="de">This must be done transparently and democratically if we are to have legitimacy with our citizens, too. Efficiency, transparency, democracy and civil rights are essential components of the arrangement to be decided at the Summit and the Intergovernmental Conference. We have to make clear that this arrangement must strike a reasonable balance between the institutions, including in relation to the national parliaments, which should assume a more important role under the principle of subsidiarity. We must ensure it is made clear that the EU neither is nor wants to become a state, but that capacity for action will be established in areas where Member States believe joint action is better.</p>
      <p sl="de">As part of this, we must accept and foster the identity of our peoples in future. Europe is not taking the place of the nation-states; instead it is a common organisation to make these nation-states stronger together. This is what the starting point must be. At the same time, the European Union must be based on equality between large and small, rich and poor. This is why double voting – whereby each country, large or small, has one vote – is so important.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also have to look at the distribution of powers and responsibilities and, with it, the principle of subsidiarity and the extension of majority voting. We cannot fight terrorism and organised crime successfully unless we have majority voting in the necessary fields, such as internal policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that our Europe must be based on values. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is an essential component as far as Parliament is concerned.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">All of this has to be incorporated – which is why the legal personality and the removal of the pillar structure are so important. The EU’s success story is based on our being a common body of law in the fields in which we have powers and responsibilities, and on our use of the Monnet method. The intergovernmental approach has always failed. The EFTA has failed, whilst the EU has been a winner thanks to the Monnet method. That is why we should not now fall back on methods that have failed in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, we should support the German Council Presidency. We should prepare the ground for the provision of the necessary substance, and win all 27 peoples and Member States over to this objective, so as to give this Intergovernmental Conference a clear and clearly delimited mandate. We must ensure that the substance of the Constitutional Treaty is present, so that negotiations are based on this Treaty alone. In addition, the Constitutional Treaty should be in force by the next elections to the European Parliament, so that citizens will be able to work with their new rights and, in future, to decide themselves at European elections who the new Commission President should be. This is a decisive contribution to strengthening the role of citizens. I would ask for the support of the House for this strategy, on which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs decided by a large majority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commission Vice-President Wallström, ladies and gentlemen. Mr President, I trust I may refrain from commenting on the ages of the two rapporteurs in favour of discussing the content of their speeches. I should like to express my particular thanks to the Presidency and Mr Barón Crespo, and also to Mr Brok, for the roadmap showing the way ahead for discussions on the constitutional process.</p>
      <p sl="de">The conclusions provide important support for further action by the Council Presidency in the run-up to the June Summit. The support of the European Parliament is also essential for success, and it is important to have Parliament’s full involvement in the discussions on treaty reform. As has been mentioned, Parliament must therefore have sufficient involvement also in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to express once more my very warm gratitude for the constructive cooperation we have enjoyed, which is also reflected in the report presented today. I consider this a balanced report: it strikes the necessary balance between an ambitious result for the European Union and the realism with which this issue has to be approached.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the one hand, we neither can, nor do we want to, ignore the public vote in France and the Netherlands; on the other, however, the majority of Member States does want to retain the substance of this Treaty. Therefore, I should like to highlight once more at this juncture the special role of the German Presidency as mediator. We want a result acceptable to all Member States – but also, of course, to Parliament. We must take account of the discussions held not only in the Netherlands and France but also elsewhere since the negative outcome of the referendums.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to take people’s concerns seriously; but, at the same time – as the discussions have also shown – there are numerous fields in which citizens want to see more Europe, more EU involvement. There has been extensive discussion recently of the issues of energy and the climate, and also of EU common foreign policy and the fight against terrorism and crime in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one fact confirmed by numerous surveys that I consider very important, and that is that the majority of Europeans do not oppose the European Union. They want to see an EU that is capable of action and efficient, that concentrates on the essentials, that really solves the problems it tackles.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is no secret that agreement has yet to be reached on a series of important issues; to begin with, there are discussions on the future architecture of the treaties. Nor would I be divulging a secret if I said there are proposals for a return to a classic amending treaty. Parliament, too, has expressed its readiness to think about the presentation of future treaties. I am counting on our finding a solution to this that all our partners can support and that also represents clear progress in terms of readability and transparency for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Mr Brok, too, has just reiterated, Parliament has always been an active champion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Therefore, Parliament’s support for retaining the Charter, and particularly its legally binding nature, has the agreement of the large majority of Member States.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The European Union, now with 27 Member States, must improve its ability to act and to take decisions in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century. As has been said, there is also a consensus on the desirability of a European Union that is more democratic and more transparent. That is why the large majority of Member States wants to retain the substance of the present Constitutional Treaty in its essentials. The majority view is that the institutional package, in particular, cannot be opened, as to do so would be like opening Pandora’s box, so to speak. The practical politics of moving forward are also important, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want a result acceptable to all Member States, but there needs to be a readiness to compromise on all sides for this to succeed. I am counting on there being the common will to move Europe forward together. In this situation, we set particular store, of course, by the support of Parliament for the endeavours of the German Council Presidency to achieve a consensus at the June Summit – which is highlighted in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to make some further remarks of a procedural nature and on the objectives of the German Presidency. As you know, the consultations have now reached the crucial phase. The dialogue is now mainly being conducted by the Council President, Chancellor Merkel, but also by German Foreign Affairs Minister Steinmeier in a personal capacity. Mr Steinmeier will be informing the House tomorrow about the preparations for the June European Council. As the high-level consultations are still going on, it is too early to present Presidency proposals with any specific content as yet. As I see it, the Council intends to, and can, present such proposals only at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aims for the June European Council are the achievement of clear guidelines in terms of content for the planned Intergovernmental Conference, and a very precise schedule. The Intergovernmental Conference is to be brought to a close in political terms in 2007 under the Portuguese Presidency. The Treaty is to be signed by the start of 2008 at the latest, thus leaving sufficient time for it to be ratified in all the Member States – and this before the 2009 elections to the European Parliament, of course, which is the important point. Previous talks have revealed a broad consensus on this timetable, for which Parliament’s roadmap, too, makes a call. If we are to keep to this timetable, it is also important that Parliament deliver its opinion pursuant to Article 48 before the summer recess.</p>
      <p sl="de">I repeat, however: the Presidency is acting as mediator. We need a result acceptable to all. We are holding talks with all the Member States, Parliament and the Commission. I know that much effort at persuasion and much mediation remain to be done, but I am confident. If all 27 Member States always speak of the common challenges, as they did most recently in the Berlin Declaration, I assume this means that all 27 of them want to see success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this report, and for your work, which adds a major contribution to this very crucial period that we are in. The Commission welcomes your report and shares its main thrust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two years after the launch of the reflection period, the world is still changing and the political context has kept changing. The European Union has been able to find a new consensus on some highly political dossiers and issues, such as agreeing a new financial package for the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the difficulties that the Constitutional Treaty was addressing have basically not been solved. The Union is still not able to speak with a single voice in the world arena. We still need to improve democracy, efficiency and the transparency of this Union. We have to ensure a better delivery on key policy areas such as migration or climate change. That is why we are deeply convinced that Treaty changes are still necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also believe that there is a strong need to communicate better with the citizens on a new Treaty review exercise. This exercise is not about building European construction for its own sake, but about being able to address the increasingly globalised political environment and deliver on policies that really matter to our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving towards a Treaty settlement will be the key issue of the European Council. The German Presidency has made a huge effort in the past months to build a new consensus among the Member States and the European institutions. We support those efforts and we hope that the European Council will be able to agree on the launch of a new intergovernmental conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we must be very careful: the Constitutional Treaty is a compromise which at this stage is difficult to improve but easy to unravel. Therefore, for new negotiations to be successful, the Intergovernmental Conference needs a to have a clear and stringent mandate and a clear goal in mind, i.e. a new Treaty to be in force before the 2009 European elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to play a central part in reaching a solution. If an intergovernmental conference is to be launched, we will be ready to bring forward our opinion in early July. A new solution should be able to command a true and durable consensus. It should be able to strike a balance between the voices of those who have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty and those who have not.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, keeping a high level of ambition is also essential. A lowest common denominator solution might bring short-term relief, but it could compound problems in the future. Simply introducing minor institutional changes in the Treaty of Nice will therefore not be sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Constitutional Treaty was the fruit of a detailed examination by the Convention; it is the result of a careful compromise agreed by all the heads of state and government and endorsed by the European Parliament. As far as the substance is concerned, the major part of that work remains valid. The innovations introduced by the Constitutional Treaty are still pertinent and they need to be translated into reality. The Community method must be protected, including the Commission’s right of initiative. The single-pillar structure and the single legal personality are tangible instruments to enhance the Union’s capacity to act in a global world. Advances in qualified majority voting and, in general, the enhanced role of the European Parliament should not be questioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Constitutional Treaty also provides a very good solution on how to involve the national parliaments and it strikes a good balance between the role of the national parliaments and that of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also remains deeply attached to the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to the substantial innovations on the policies set out in the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">There must be no dilution of the single market, but we are open to examining new ideas for developments in certain policy areas in order to face new or reinforce key policy challenges, such as sustainable development, migration or energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares the view that the European Parliament should be closely associated with the coming Intergovernmental Conference, at least matching the involvement it enjoyed in the previous IGC. Together we should also continue intensively our efforts to engage citizens and civil society in an effective dialogue about the future of Europe. Together we ought to explain to citizens what is at stake and why a new Treaty settlement is necessary to make the Union capable of facing the challenges of the age of globalisation. This will be even more important in the crucial phase which will begin on the basis of the European Council decisions, and I look forward to working closely with you to make this a reality.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, in a story by Hemingway — the Old Man and the Sea — the protagonist battles to bring a marlin back to port. It is a titanic battle. When he finally reaches port, however, the fish is no longer there, and only its bones remain. That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is what this Parliament does not want to happen with the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">We applaud the German Presidency for wanting to reach an agreement, but we wish to tell it clearly that, though we want an agreement, we do not just want any kind of agreement. In the report drawn up by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, therefore, we state clearly what we believe to be the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty that that agreement must take up: we state it in paragraph 9.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also say that we must listen to everybody, but we must not just listen to those people who want less Europe (because there are some people who only want less Europe). Do not just listen to them. Listen also to those who want to improve the Constitutional Treaty. Because all we hear about are reductions, as if the spring sales had arrived in the big stores.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is possible for an Intergovernmental Conference to improve the Constitutional Treaty: for example, by incorporating issues that were not on the table five years ago, such as climate change, energy or solidarity with regard to energy, or defining the duties of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator, a very important issue today, following ETA’s announcement that it will go back to killing. Those additions are possible, and we would urge you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to include them.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the President of Parliament said previously, what we want is to help you, and we want the European Parliament also to participate in this Intergovernmental Conference. We do not want to replace you, of course, but in paragraph 12 of the report we define the methods for this Parliament’s involvement.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament will judge the result of the Intergovernmental Conference in terms of the Constitutional Treaty, and we say this in paragraph 11. We shall have no hesitation in rejecting any agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Conference should it not meet our expectations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Richard Corbett will shortly address this matter in more specific terms for our group. I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Enrique Barón Crespo and Elmar Brok, because this report is an entirely accurate reflection of the debate we have been conducting since the double ‘no’ vote two years ago. The message of this report is unequivocal. The substance of what has been negotiated, signed and accepted over the past three years, in other words the substance of the Treaty, must be preserved, but it is incontestable that the presentation of the Treaty may conceivably be altered. To put it quite plainly, the European Parliament rejects a mini-treaty. We are also opposed to the emergence of a mere institutional treaty and to negotiations on a skeleton, on a quarry from which this and that stone can be extracted at will. What we are saying quite clearly is that this Parliament will not accept the outcome of consultations if it would mean less democracy, less transparency, less efficiency and fewer civil rights than the outcome we previously approved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The irony is that the citizens of Europe, whether in France, the Netherlands or the other countries, actually support change. The Eurobarometer surveys show that the public want more democracy and a more effective Union. They also want the new European policies on energy, health, disaster prevention and mutual assistance in emergencies. For this reason it is incomprehensible that governments should now discard something which parliaments and governments jointly produced. That is out of order, and we will not accept it.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is also a message to the Intergovernmental Conference. You cannot come up with a formula of your own without consulting this Parliament and without consulting our counterparts in the national parliaments and the general public if that formula differs fundamentally from the Treaty we have been forging over the past four years. We want a ‘Treaty plus’ rather than a ‘Treaty minus’. The view has been expressed here that these issues we have been discussing for two years ought to be put on the agenda. We should talk about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">We always speak of those who rejected the Treaty. We must also speak of the many who have already given their consent. It cannot be a matter of achieving an outcome at any price. We shall not support that. It must be an instrument of high quality. We wish the German Presidency every success in the pursuit of that goal.</p>

      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I think it is possible to draw two principal thoughts from the period of reflection. The first is that we have to strengthen democracy inside the European institutions in Brussels and between the authorities here and national, regional and local governments. The second is that we should devise cleverer and more flexible ways to change the Treaties in future. Countries that still wish to refuse the package may have the legal veto, but they will not have the moral and political authority to block progress for everyone else.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, who have tremendous experience. I thank them for their work with this own-initiative report. It comes at a critical time when the members of the Council need to be edged and pushed in a certain way. That requirement is not because of what we here in Parliament want to see with regard to the future development of the European Union, but because of the necessity to ensure that the voices of the peoples of the European Union are properly reflected at all levels of administration and operation of the European Union in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">If anything, the success of the European Union has been the uniqueness of the institutions predicated upon the basis of consensus, compromise and equality, and the need to maintain that kind of balance to ensure that it does not become a two-tier Europe; to ensure that Donald Rumsfeld’s notion of an old and a new Europe will never come to fruition. Rather, we need a Europe working together, le chéile, and cooperating together for the benefit of all the peoples.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our primary source must be the agreed text that we already have. Let us look at the uniqueness of the Convention that came up with that text. Let us ensure that we maintain the core of that text whilst at the same time making the necessary adjustments to guarantee that all Member States can agree and sign up to it and that none feel threatened by it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our task today is to ensure that the message goes out loud and clear that Parliament supports future developments of the European Treaty that rightly reflect the new Member States and rightly reflect the balances that must be maintained for the successful operation of a Europe of nations of equality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my group wishes this report a large and convincing majority, and we hope that it will indeed receive that level of support. We thank the rapporteurs for this excellent proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">This resolution can assume great significance if the House succeeds in conveying the message to our governments that it is truly prepared to champion the cause of European democracy, that it is truly prepared to defend the enshrinement of the fundamental rights and that it is truly prepared to fight for the dissolution of the pillar structure and the preservation of qualified majority voting in the Constitutional Treaty, even at the risk of having to say ‘no’. In the course of many years, I have experienced many ultimatums in this Chamber and many grandiose gestures and a great deal of shouting from the barricades and many promises to vote ‘no’ if this or that decision did not reflect the public interest. Not once have I ever seen this House actually take to the barricades, vote ‘no’ or act on a single ultimatum. If we do not stand fast on this present ultimatum, however, this House will have to face the judgment of history.</p>
      <p sl="de">After two years of the period for reflection – whoever might have done any reflecting – the governments have run up lengthy lists of sins. Indeed, we could speak of the Seven Deadly Sins of governments. Parliaments, including this House, have long been excluded from the constitutive process. The public have been sidelined. The process is now taking place behind closed doors. A kind of nationalism is manifesting itself ever more brazenly and blatantly in many Member States across Europe without meeting any real resistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The discussion on the amendment of the Treaty is a far cry from the referendums in France and the Netherlands, from the calls for more democracy, for more social responsibility for Europe, for a response to globalisation and for a more effective Union. None of the demands that are on the table today have anything to do with what people have been calling for. They have a great deal to do, however, with what the governments have been calling for loud and long, even in the Convention, namely the assertion of their own authority and the infringement and overturning of the consensus we wrung out of them in the Convention. No longer do we hear of the merits of Europe, of more social responsibility and more democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The governments are misappropriating the referendum results in France and the Netherlands. They are misappropriating them to diminish Europe, to create their own intergovernmental, socially irresponsible Europe. We should not take that lying down. This constitution is a guarantor of European democracy and hence the key to resolving the social issues of the future. I doubt whether the pivotal negotiating principle, which consists in the avoidance of referendums, represents an effective strategy. We shall not overcome this crisis of confidence in Europe if we bypass the people. We can only resolve it by winning them over.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in the report by our fellow Members, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, we read, in recital H, with regards to the French and Dutch rejection of the draft Constitutional Treaty, the following words: ‘many of the misgivings expressed related to the context, rather than the content, and the issues of major public concern have since been resolved’. That is what is called reassuring oneself on the cheap. The conclusion from such a diagnosis is obvious. It is stated in the first paragraph and I quote: ‘reaffirms its endorsement of the content of the Constitutional Treaty’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the report intends to take into account the difficulties that have arisen in certain Member States, but paragraph 6 makes abundantly clear the extent of the concessions that it could agree to when it reaffirms, and I quote, ‘its commitment to achieving a settlement of the ongoing constitutional process of the European Union, that is based on the content of the Constitutional Treaty, possibly under a different presentation’. The similarity of this approach to that suggested in one of the 12 questions that Mrs Merkel addressed last month to the Heads of State or Government is striking. Remember, I quote: ‘what do you think about the proposal to change the wording without changing the substance?’</p>
      <p sl="fr">These three extracts from Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok’s report sum up perfectly the reasons for my group’s disagreement with the text proposed to us. It is no service to Europe to hide from the increasing problems raised by a fundamental part of the acquis communautaire among our citizens, that is, some of the implications of what our Treaties call the open market economy where competition is free.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Three examples: on 22 May last, at the congress of the European Trade Union Confederation, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, was able to confirm the truth of this to his cost when his argument for pay restraint in the name of price competitiveness in an open economy was unanimously rejected. A few days earlier, Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner, had a similar experience, this time at the Council, where more and more government representatives asked for privatisation of postal services to be postponed in view of the general public outcry aroused by this draft directive. There again, also, a few days ago, 10 industrial associations that are very vulnerable to global competition accused the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, of showing free trade zeal with, I quote, ‘unacceptable consequences’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is, no doubt, this avalanche of protests that the German Minister for the Economy and Finance, Mr Steinbrück, must have had in mind when he spoke recently of, I quote, ‘a risk of the European economic and social model suffering a crisis of legitimacy’. That is why my group is arguing resolutely in favour of, first of all, a very open public debate about what needs to change in the orientation and structures of the Union, and then for a ratification of the future European Treaty by means of a referendum.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the report by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok is typified by considerable inner conflict and ambiguity. On the one hand, the rapporteurs recognise – albeit with the greatest reluctance – that the Constitution must be amended. I note with satisfaction, therefore, that even the European Parliament is starting to take this fact on board.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On the other hand, I was disappointed to establish that in paragraph 6 – as Mr Wurtz has already mentioned – it is evident to what extent, or should I say to what little extent, they are prepared to amend the Constitution: the substance of the Constitution should not be touched, just the packaging.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am the first one to admit that it is the members of the Council (including my own Prime Minister) who give reason to believe that a cosmetic change to the Constitution would be acceptable. Despite this, I would urge the European Parliament to change its strategy. Indeed, from the Council, there is increasing indication that it is actually the substance that will be the subject of discussion. If the European Parliament really wants to make a contribution to a successful IGC, as the rapporteurs have indicated several times in their report, it must be prepared to reach compromises regarding the content; if not, the European Parliament will continue to play a minor role in the forthcoming IGC. This is a scenario that does not appeal to me and will not appeal to either of the rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">says the Gospel according to St John: the truth shall make you free. What is this truth? The truth is that you want to create a European superstate, in spite of Mr Brok’s denials. After all, a political organisation with an international legal personality, with a presidency that is no longer a rotating presidency, with a Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a single currency, an indefinite extension of competences that are no longer allocated by pillar, and, within these competences, a decision by majority: that is called a European superstate!</p>
      <p sl="fr">I quite understand, ladies and gentlemen, that there are those among you, and no doubt they are the majority, who are in agreement with this development. In that case, however, you should be open and honest enough to say so to our compatriots. It is, however, a reality, as we have heard again just now in Mr Brok’s speech, that you are bent on covering it up, and that, I think, is not honest or decent. If you wish to remain within the framework of an international organisation, why not be satisfied with the existing Treaties?</p>
      <p sl="fr">There was the Treaty of Paris which established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). Then, there was the Treaty of Rome establishing Euratom and the European Economic Community. Later, we were told that we needed to merge the executives of these international organisations to give them more power. We merged them! Later again, in 1986, we were told that we needed the Single European Act so that Europe could really bear all its fruit and fulfil expectations. So we had the Single European Act. No sooner was this Single European Act adopted, than we were told that it was not enough, that we needed the Treaty of Maastricht from which would flow milk and honey. After Maastricht, there was Amsterdam. After Amsterdam, there was Nice. You are involved in a process which aims to create this European superstate. It is contrary to the spirit of Europe, which is the place that invented the freedom and independence of nations. That is the reason why we are resolutely opposed to it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, ‘no’ is really not a difficult word to understand. The continuing failure to accept the political reality of rejection is epitomised by paragraph 3 of this report. There it notes the concerns expressed by the French and Dutch people. France and the Netherlands did not express concern; they expressed rejection. It is the refusal to face that reality that has embedded the EU in the rut of the past two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report will do nothing to move us on because it still insists on everything which has been rejected, namely the apparatus of statehood for the EU and further diminution in national powers and vetoes. It is those who cannot accept that the Constitution has floundered who are pushing towards a two-speed Europe. If that is what you must have, then go for it. Just leave out of it those states that still want real national control and power. And, even as a quid pro quo, let us repatriate real powers, let us bring them back from Brussels. Then those who want more Europe can have it, and those who want less can have that.

      <p sl="el">The vision is to maintain basic elements of the Constitutional Treaty. The pragmatism is for us to be selective and to negotiate among ourselves in order to find a new compromise, but it must be a compromise that maintains the principles and values on which we relied in the Convention on the Future of Europe in order to create the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="el">You have quite rightly emphasised that human rights cannot be missing from this text, whatever the text decided, and that is quite right, as are the other elements you referred to.</p>
      <p sl="el">This Parliament must be at the vanguard of efforts to find a solution and way out of the constitutional crisis faced by the European Union. The European Union cannot continue at its present marked pace. The challenges of globalisation are such that, if it does not proceed, quickly and correctly, it will not be able to play the role it needs to play on the basis of our principles and values.</p>
      <p sl="el">Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about compromise. When we talk about compromise, we must be balanced and realistic. The 18 states and the 4 states which intend to ratify the Constitutional Treaty as it stands cannot be ready to come to a compromise, while the other states and the citizens of the other states are talking about an unyielding fight on certain points on which their argument is based. We must be correct and we must also be fair. That applies to everyone, both those who have approved the Constitutional Treaty and those who have a certain scepticism.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I believe that the European Union cannot carry on like this; it must go forward, it must give the citizens a future, it must give this Union a future, so that it can move forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Mr Allister has just said that the word ‘no’ is not difficult to understand, but equally the word ‘yes’ is not difficult to understand. We are in a situation where a large majority of Member States have said yes. Two have said no, some have a few reservations, but all 27 have agreed to embark on a process of trying to bridge that gap, of trying to find a solution capable of ratification by all 27. This report, which I commend and my group will be supporting, endorses that attempt. We think it is right to make an attempt to bridge that gap and to find a solution capable of ratification by all 27.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament, elected by the citizens of the European Union, approved the Constitutional Treaty in adopting by an overwhelming majority the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and myself two years ago. So it is quite natural that we side with the 22 Member States who wish to keep the text as intact as possible. I think that is quite logical. This Parliament would prefer changes of form to sacrificing the content. It would prefer to relinquish the symbols rather than the substance. That is clear and that will no doubt be part of the solution, but it is unlikely to be enough. The issues of the substance of the Constitution will have to be addressed in some cases, perhaps to improve, extend or revise it. But it is essential that we try to keep those practical reforms in the Constitutional Treaty, and it is a collection of very practical reforms – those reforms that make the EU capable of functioning as it continues to enlarge and that improve its democratic accountability. Those are essential and must be kept. The Constitutional Treaty contains such a package of reforms. Let us do our utmost to salvage as many of those reforms as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I hope she has taken and will take as her guiding principle what she herself proposed before work began on the Berlin Declaration. Then she hoped and made it a condition that the Berlin Declaration would be something which every European would want and could read. The Constitution should be like that.

The EU does not deserve, it cannot have and it will not have a constitution until it can be drafted openly, and not behind people’s backs.</p>

We must now have the courage to admit that this text is not clear: it is a vague and confusing package, and no amount of careful reading makes it sufficiently clear.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Madam President, it would also be interesting to know how many Members of the European Parliament or members of national parliaments have read the entire text of this Constitution: these rules which say how the EU will operate, what its policies will be, its competencies and way of making decisions.

The European Parliament is operating according to a logic that allows no room for compromise, and must therefore bear its share of responsibility for the failure of the Treaty reform process.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Instead of tightening up conditions we now need gestures of goodwill towards the countries that have expressed misgivings concerning the former text of the treaty. If the reform is to be brought to a successful conclusion, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and France must receive a new offer and a more flexible negotiating mandate at the intergovernmental conference as regards representation for Foreign Affairs, the division of competence and also the voting system in the Council. Exerting pressure to prevent this debate can only lead to the loss of further years.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the European Parliament is now adopting a position with reference to its committee’s own initiative report on something that is not within its competence, neither in terms of the content or the end result. Accordingly, the report is europropaganda in favour of a constitution in an area where the political elite are out of touch with the people. According to an opinion poll covering the whole of the EU, 75% of EU citizens would like a referendum on the Constitution, in which the people in 11 of the old Member States would reject it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">My own country, Finland, has ratified the defunct agreement, and that was done against the will of the people. A new opinion poll commissioned by our group in Finland shows that Finns are opposed to a constitution throughout the country as a whole: in all age groups, all professions and all political parties. The European Parliament is taking the side of the Constitution against the opinion of people in many countries. That will not improve its legitimacy or the legitimacy of the Constitution in Member States. One should have the courage to ask the opinion of the people.</p>

The process has therefore begun of expelling from the decision-making process one of its less manageable elements, in other words the citizens of the Member States. This idea was expressed in a secret questionnaire that the German Presidency sent out to the governments of the Member States. One point on the questionnaire openly includes the question: ‘what if we were to adopt under a different name a document with the same content and the same legally binding nature as the Constitution?’ It could not have been put more bluntly. Furthermore, in order not to sound so coarse, we throw in a little climate-related alarmism, and for the more stubborn ones an enhanced form of energy solidarity as a sweetener, so that they will have something to show to the folks back home. More importantly, we remove the right of veto from the small countries and secure a new majority for the big countries. Then we name it in such a way that we will no longer have to hold a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The authors of the report prefer to overlook the fact that Germany has yet to ratify the Constitution, and they do so because the President’s signature will be sufficient to ratify it. They also overlook the fact that the Constitution was ratified by just 16 of the 27 Member States, accounting for just 37% of the population of the EU. And they overlook the fact that the two year deadline has expired, by which at least 80% of the Member States were to have ratified the Constitution in order for the process to continue. And finally, they overlook the fact that this requirement was laid down in a Constitution that was forced on the new Member States as part of their accession agreements.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The report is ambivalent in that it emphatically supports the core components of the Constitutional Treaty, whilst also taking the developments of recent years into account, even though this could have been done to a greater extent. After all, the public is critical of the functioning of Europe, and this is not just in the Netherlands and France. It is very important that this Parliament, too, give due account to this criticism. Fortunately, there is now increasing support in Europe for the idea that things have to change. Out with the Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report can count on our support, even though we have problems with a few paragraphs. We support the report because it stands up for the core elements of the Constitutional Treaty. At the same time – and this is something which is being denied by some – it also opens the door to change: clarification of the term ‘subsidiarity’, no constitutional traits, no European state and, with regard to a number of problems we face in this day and age, more ambition at European level, and also the participation of the public and the role of the national parliaments. This role should, however, show due respect for the role of this House.</p>

Instead of quibbling over these legal subterfuges, Europe should focus on its practical problems and summon its energies to protect production, work and jobs, for instance by responding to the specific, weighty concerns of European industries with facts rather than with vague bureaucratic jargon, as Mr Mandelson has done. Our industries are demanding to be protected against the stop that our ultraliberal trade Commissioner has put on antidumping measures since the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our businesses and jobs are suffering on account of these wrong decisions, which have been further aggravated by today’s decision by the European Central Bank to increase minimum lending rates. The decisions made by Brussels are wrong because they slow down our journey towards progress, jobs and the welfare of Europe and are therefore divorced from the deeply-held feelings and opinions of European citizens who pay their taxes partly to maintain Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Presidency of the Council will have to square the circle at the summit. Since European integration will only succeed if all Member States pull together, I believe the only possible way out of the crisis on the constitution is to give the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference a mandate with clear terms of reference and a clear timetable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The only possible starting point for negotiations is the existing text of the Constitutional Treaty. It bears the signatures of all 27 Heads of State or Government. Two thirds of all Member States, representing a majority of the population of the Union, have ratified it in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. Let me express my firm support for paragraph 11 of the report, which states that any outcome of the negotiations which, if compared with the Constitutional Treaty, would lead to a diminution of the protection of fundamental rights as well as to less democracy, transparency and efficiency in the functioning of the Union will be rejected. This applies particularly to any erosion of the welfare state. The clause of general application of social policy in Part III of the Constitutional Treaty, for example, must be non-negotiable. The same applies to the values referred to in Article 1(2), in which the Union is defined as a community based on common values. It is a good thing that our Parliament is showing the red card to all those who seek to withdraw into the shell of national sovereignty under cover of the ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="de">The downright ridiculous shadow-boxing with the symbols of European integration must also be stopped. People in Europe do not want arguments about flags or anthems; what they want are bold solutions that bring progress. We therefore need a ‘Constitution-plus’ solution, especially for the sake of reinforcing the European social model.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, advocates of the European Constitution are making a consistent effort to transform the European Community and Union into a continental superstate. This is the main difficulty with the European Constitution. Such an approach is not in the interests of the nations of Europe. Despite the many democratic declarations made, it will amount to the first step on the slippery slope towards totalitarianism on our continent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The gradual elimination of the political functions of contemporary national structures is a very dangerous development. A take-over of the political functions of nation states by supra-national structures will be detrimental to the cultural heritage of individual nations. In the longer term, it will lead to the disappearance of sovereign nations. An end must therefore be put to the suicidal processes of building a European superstate. The European Constitution and all its replacements must be rejected. The free nations of Europe do not need the Constitution in order to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A debate must be launched immediately on how to guarantee the rights of nations in the contemporary world, notably in Europe. It is characteristic of the advocates of the European Constitution to avoid the use of the term sovereignty, as if they were horrified by it. In their mercy they offer us the right to an identity, but one can retain that even when one is deprived of freedom. The European Constitution amounts to an attack on sovereignty. It is a threat to the sovereignty of nation states, to their freedom and self-determination. I call on the House to allow nations to live in freedom. The nations of Europe wish to retain sovereign states!</p>

      <p sl="pt">At the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference the EU must look to the future, and must look into the very essence of its being. It was here in Europe that the enlightenment proclaimed the transcendent value of human dignity and prescribed a union of people to bring this value to life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As long ago as the 18th century, Kant set down the maxims for eternal life and said that the national constitutions of countries cannot accomplish their tasks without the appropriate external order. Modernity is built on anthropocentric politics, on flexible institutions and on power as a conduit of justice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Constitution is one of the tasks ahead of us that can enable us to accomplish, during our lifetime, the modernity of which Europe is the cradle. Do we not want a project of justice that is only possible if underpinned by political sharing? If so, then the Constitution is the answer. It provides the foundation for large-scale democracy, for strengthening Parliament’s power, for restoring the balance between the centre and the Member States, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, for political work within a network, and for rules on decision-making that confer governability and effectiveness, with a view to achieving a human and open Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The world is, with increasing frequency, confronting us with new realities. The political elites have a responsibility to build new paradigms and to define new ways of living. As we proceed along this path to consensus – and, at this point, I should like to pay tribute to the efforts of Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok – I am saddened by the devaluation of the symbols of Europe. It is not as though this responds to any real cause for concern among the citizens. Rather, it responds to spectres raised in random, extremist discourse. Europe is in a phase of re-establishing its foundations and now is not the time to do away with its symbolic dimension. Paul Valéry once said that Europe would be built only under the threat of decline.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Perhaps we could retort that Europe is being built by moral will and serene reason. One thing is for sure, when it comes to this odyssey, there can be no room for half measures.</p>

      <p sl="es">We shall not tire of saying that the European Constitution is not the problem, but rather the solution.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that those of us who were in the Convention can state that the Constitution that we drew up there is actually the best possible solution. For three reasons at least: because of the consensus it achieved, because of the significant advances it contains and also because it will enable us to complete the Political Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we now have to do — and this is the aim of the report by Mr Barón and Mr Brok — is rescue it; not mess it up, not confuse it, not turn it — to use a word from Italian politics — into the ‘cosa [thing]’. We need a constitution, not a ‘cosa’ that is indefinable.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end, I believe that we need to bear three factors in mind. Firstly, the message. I do not like the idea of stopping calling it a ‘Constitution’. I do not like the idea of getting rid of symbols. I do not even like the idea of changing its form in order to make it incomprehensible. If we have no choice but to do that, however, we must at least save its content. That content includes something that we forget to mention all too often: the extension of codecision and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, in view of the procedure, do we in this Parliament realise that we are talking about a process to rescue the Constitution that is too secretive, that is too intergovernmental? At the end of the day, we are talking about what we want, but we often do not know what we are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the European Parliament must address the governments clearly, stating what this report says, but it must also address the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we reject the result of the IGC, we shall also call upon those parliaments to act accordingly.</p>

Of course, we need democracy even more than we need light. We do not address the people. A worker in Poland or a farmer in Greece or a doctor in Belgium has no idea what is finally happening with this Constitution. We need democracy. We must not be afraid of the people. We must address the people and find out what their opinion is. All of them, on the same day, in a general referendum. We decide on behalf of the people.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have three points. Firstly, it is important that we do not let the problems with the new Treaty overshadow developments in the European Union and our achievements. In a way, our achievements are the best arguments for a new Treaty. They give us new responsibilities and underline the need for new power to make decisions. If the European Union were a failure, no one would have turned to us to deal with climate change or to contribute to stability in the Balkans. We would have had no new applications for membership. Let us not forget that achievements are the main arguments for a new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we must ensure that the new Treaty results from political challenges and not from different political symbols. We must be able to welcome new Members and to have clear, democratic control and accountability with regard to the common decisions we make. We must have the opportunity to make the necessary decisions in order to fight crime, to meet the challenges of environmental and energy policy and to secure stability in our neighbourhood and in other parts of the world where it is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we need to understand and make sure that it is more important to have a common foreign policy than a common foreign minister. It is more important to be able to make crucial decisions than to have an elected President of the European Council. It is more important to ensure that we are able to make decisions in all the areas where we face challenges today. That is more important than symbols are. We need a Treaty, not necessarily exactly the one under discussion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think that if this Parliament wants to do something worthwhile at this stage, it must defend the Charter of Fundamental Rights, because I think it will be the sick child of the outcome of the negotiations between the Heads of State or Government. I think too that the report presented to us by our fellow Members, Mr Enrique Barón Crespo and Mr Elmar Brok, opens, in paragraphs 12 and 17, a future way forward on which we must rely. These paragraphs say that our citizens’ expectations are about fundamental matters not institutional issues. Paragraph 17 calls on the Commission to modernise and to adapt, in return for certain modifications, the text which is before us today, taking those expectations into account. That is the issue at stake.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue is that the European Council’s conclusions on 8 March should be incorporated into our policies so that the Union is able to function in such a way as to realise the policies that our citizens expect. These policies are concerned with environmental coherence, with the ability to face up to the energy challenges that confront us, and expectations in social terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the reality of the issues at stake and that is the reason why what Mr Enrique Barón Crespo and Mr Elmar Brok are proposing to us is, in my opinion, acceptable as long as people are not being taken for idiots. Contenting oneself with proposing to them a change in the presentation of the text, imagining that it is only the context that could have made some nations say no, would not be in keeping with the reality of the vote of these nations. I hope that it is in this direction that the House will vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is clear that the starting point for any Treaty revision exercise must be the current text of the Constitution for a simple reason: it was signed by all Member States. Surely if a signature means something then they have to show commitment to it, and it was also ratified by 18 Member States. From that starting point we should seek a compromise that takes into account three factors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is the concerns of those countries that have rejected it, and the concerns of those countries that have still not ratified it. The second is that we should take into account some mistakes that we may have made – and yes, we may have made some mistakes along the way. For instance, we may have gone too fast and too far in signing a constitution just five months after the greatest and biggest enlargement of the European Union, or by appearing too ambitious not least by the designation of the Treaty as a Constitution when originally our mandate was a mere simplification.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly and finally, the point we should take into account is that the compromise must also take into account the new reality in which we live and the new challenges that we face and which may not have been sufficiently taken into account by the Constitution. I have in mind, for instance, a common immigration policy and a common approach to climate change. Yes, the Germany Presidency, and the Portuguese Presidency after it, have a fine balancing act to strike and we wish them luck. They certainly need it!</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you very much, Mr President. I want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for having put forward a well-balanced proposal whereby the European Parliament sticks to its views on the Treaty but, at the same time, is realistic and understands that changes will take place. These changes must not take place at the cost of only a mini-treaty, involving solely institutional issues, being adopted. Account must be taken not only of the two countries that have rejected the Constitutional Treaty but also of all those countries that have said ‘yes’ to it. A new Treaty must reflect those issues that people think are important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The climate threat needs to feature in it, as does social Europe, and it is important – as others too have said – that it be possible to implement enlargement. I do not, however, believe that the solution is to introduce the Copenhagen criteria into the Treaty. Instead, institutional reforms are required. Moreover, it is important that we not only talk about transparency in Europe. The process that is now just getting under way must be an open one involving dialogue with Europeans, so that we might conduct a debate while the process continues.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Next, I have something to say to the far right, which often makes a point of preaching intergovernmental collaboration as opposed to supranationalism. The far right has put forward the most supranationalist proposals of all and wants to force the Member States to hold referendums. The fact is, it is for the Member States themselves to decide how they are to deal with this Constitutional Treaty. The forces of the right have gone much too far in this instance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, today’s report has emerged during the German Presidency and I should therefore like first to thank our German friends for their considerable efforts in persuading the Council at its June summit to make a commitment to calling an intergovernmental conference and to implementing a working plan with the clear aim of reaching agreement by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Following its historic enlargement to 27, the EU needs a new Constitutional foundation. It needs instruments with which it can function effectively and democratically. It needs resources with which it can meet the citizens’ concerns on issues such as globalisation, illegal migration and the security of energy supplies.</p>
      <p sl="cs">These instruments and resources are, to some extent, contained in the draft Constitutional Treaty ratified by two thirds of the Member States. Four other states have confirmed their commitment to ratifying it and to retaining the fundamental principles and content of this document. This clear majority, this coalition of forces, should form the basis for further negotiation the outcome of which must not, under any circumstances, lead to reduced protection for human rights or limits on the democratic and effective functioning of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Lastly, I should like to call on the governments of the three countries that have not yet ratified the Constitution, including my own, the Czech Republic, to honour what they have signed up to and put the document to their citizens for approval. And if they are afraid of their citizens, then they should at least stop hindering those who are trying to deliver a constructive, quick and democratic solution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have received a great deal of advice in the constitutional debate over the past few months, some of it good, some well-meant and some that was not even well-meant. The weirdest of the proposals was surely the idea of removing the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the body of the Treaty and keeping it alive, at least technically, by means of a reference. At first sight, it might seem that this proposal was well-meant. It would certainly suit anyone who wants a simple, easily readable text. Having 65 fewer articles is perhaps quite important in view of the poor reading levels that the Pisa study identified in this Europe of ours. On closer inspection, however, the situation looks completely different.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is at stake when we speak of fundamental rights? It is about the protection of the individual from those who have power – no more and no less. That has been, and must remain, one of the most historically important missions of any community. This is precisely why the proposal to play down the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to make it small and as invisible as possible, is so disturbing.</p>
      <p sl="de">For years in Austria we have had a charity known as Licht ins Dunkel – ‘Light into the Darkness’. It serves to help the weaker members of society, especially at Christmas time but not only then. We also need a ‘Light into Darkness’ campaign for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I am glad that very many speakers in today’s debate have stressed the need to stay on the ball with regard to the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to ensure that we have a Constitutional Treaty as a cornerstone of our future Community law.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, only a new Treaty can make the EU more democratic and more decisive. The Dutch ‘no’ in 2005 was not a ‘no’ to Europe: 72% of the Dutch consider European cooperation to be valuable. This is why it would be a disaster for the Netherlands if we were to remain stuck in a ‘no’ without any alternatives, as the Dutch Socialist Party is at risk of doing. Hence my five-point plan for a new Treaty to do justice to the Dutch ‘no’ and to tempt the majority of the Dutch back to the ‘yes’ camp.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One: a democratic Europe, fewer vetoes, more codecision for this House, openness of decision-making, goodbye to Strasbourg, improved cooperation between the EP and national parliaments, but not a red card that jumbles up the powers of both.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Two: a more social Europe. Include a social clause that spells out that public and semi-public provisions are not inferior to the market but can be fleshed out according to the insights of national Member States and regions. Make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Three: a Europe of the citizens and the regions thanks to more decentralisation and enhanced subsidiarity. Give frontier areas and the regions the chance to test things out. Give European citizens the right to add items to the agenda by means of petitions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Four: include in the new Treaty more rigorous accession criteria in order to avoid cheating. In the case of any further enlargement, we must put our own European house in order first.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to the two rapporteurs who laid the foundations for today’s debate. I also welcome what appears to me to be broad support for this project for a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, on which we still have a fair bit of work to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Íñigo Méndez de Vigo began by citing Hemingway’s tale of the fisherman and the huge fish that was nothing but bones by the time it was brought ashore. Perhaps the fisherman lacked the technical facilities that would have enabled him to land the large live fish safely. We who face these formidable challenges today, however, have all the facilities at our disposal. We have recognised that this European Union must organise itself differently to improve its decision-making capacity and to deal with issues which differ from those that were on the agenda ten or fifteen years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be a pity if this work that has been done and approved over the past few years were suddenly rejected. Let me say quite explicitly, as someone who, until recently, had always been a back-bencher, that it is wrong to use words loosely in this kind of debate. No one is foisting anything on anyone. It was the will of Members of Parliament, following the experience of Nice, to convoke a Convention, on which many Members of Parliament wanted to serve, to create a new treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The wish was unequivocally expressed that parliamentarians from countries which were not yet members of the European Union should also take part. It is wrong to cite examples now to try and demonstrate that there was some sort of compulsion involved. The fact that there was a wish to involve those countries, so as to ensure that they did not have a treaty foisted on them, was a reflection of precisely that democratic will which distinguishes this European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent days it has been said time and again that the German Presidency wants success. Of course we want success, but not for ourselves. We want it for this European Union, because on 25 March we placed on record the challenges we face and the fact that we need new instruments to deal with climate change and energy problems. And anyone who demands more solidarity from the European Union on the climate and energy must naturally ensure that the means to achieve that goal are in place. I therefore thank you for your broad support. We hope, as one honourable lady said, that the Heads of State or Government obtain a clear mandate with a fixed timetable for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

This is what nobody wants to lose at the moment. We do not want to lose several years of discussions and negotiations and the time invested in this whole process, because we want to give the European Union a stronger voice on the global scene.

      <p sl="fr">This motion recognises, at last, that the European people and their representatives sitting in the European Parliament must be more closely involved in the institutional process. If we want to move from a technocratic Europe towards a political Europe, we must stop having a Europe concocted in Embassy drawing rooms and so pass from a diplomatic Europe to a democratic Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome also the perceptiveness of the new President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy, who proposes a simplified institutional treaty. That is the only way for us to progress and hope to change our institutions with the prospect of going to the European elections in June 2009 with new rules. We have to invent the plan B that has never existed and reason must prevail over dogmatism and other demagogic positions. The Europe of the people is on the move.</p>

      <p sl="hu">According to the Constitutional Treaty, the Union’s aim is to promote peace, fundamental values, and the well-being of the people of its Member States, as well as establishing an area without internal boundaries that provides freedom and security to its citizens, achieving balanced economic growth and enhancing solidarity among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The ‘pause for reflection’ has, with the German Presidency, come to an end. Berlin was given the task of laying the foundations for the creation of the new treaty at the June 2007 summit. If the June summit is successful, the Member States will give a mandate to the upcoming Portuguese Presidency to convene an intergovernmental conference with the objective of having the complete text of the new treaty ready by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Inasmuch as the Member States will be able to agree on the new treaty, the opportunity will be there for the new European Parliament and European Commission, to be set up in 2009, to begin working on more effective, transparent and democratic foundations. This encompasses more rapid decision making, an unambiguous determination of the competences of the various European Union institutions and of the Member States, respect for subsidiarity and the reinforcement of the equality of Member States. Furthermore, a solution will have to be found in order that more attention may at last be paid to the tools and community policies necessary for achieving our common goals. Joint success depends first and foremost on the political will to act in concert.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The first issue that should be raised in this debate is that we must not overlook the fact that the draft Constitutional Treaty lapsed when it was rejected by the referendums held in France and the Netherlands in 2005. Any amendment to the current Treaty therefore means restarting the entire process, and any proposal on a new Treaty should be put to the voters in referendums to be held in each of the Member States on dates to be decided by the national authorities concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This, though, is not what the rapporteurs have done. They have reiterated their support for the so-called draft Constitutional Treaty and are thus trying to influence the decision taken at the European Council of 21 and 22 June. This is something to which we are vehemently opposed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As far as we are concerned, we wish to restate our opposition to a document that advocates neoliberalism, deeper militarisation and even greater concentration of power, which will be achieved by enshrining an upper echelon of the major EU powers at the cost of reducing democracy and diminishing the influence of the people and institutions of the small and medium-sized Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are in favour of a more democratic, fairer Europe that is characterised by solidarity, a Europe that promotes peace and cooperation with people from all parts of the world, a Europe that complies with the principle of sovereign States with equal rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">When the European Council meets on 21 to 22 June, EU Heads of State will have quite a challenge ahead of them. In effect, they will need to hammer out a relatively conclusive compromise on the main points of contention regarding Europe's institutional and constitutional future. They cannot afford to fail in this duty and subsequently start to backtrack on areas where the various national interests had to give ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">If they are successful and manage to agree on the main political sticking points, thereby paving the way for a relatively short Intergovernmental Conference to sort out the details, the moment could be the high point in the European Council's existence thus far. It will have legitimised itself beyond any doubt and, in an instant, brushed off the inertia that has characterised top-level EU decision-making in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I sincerely hope EU leaders rise up to this challenge. Everyone knows what is necessary: retaining the large majority of the Constitutional Treaty and dealing with the concerns that led to the two failed referenda in 2005. It is time to mobilise this consensus with the appropriate political will.</p>

      <p sl="de">With regard to the discussion on the road map for the EU constitutional process, I welcome the express reiteration of support by the European Parliament for the substance of the Constitutional Treaty and the clear confirmation of that support in the draft resolution. I, too, would like to stress that two thirds of the Member States have ratified the Constitutional Treaty and that we, as representatives of the people, have a political responsibility to listen to the voices of all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, I call for the preservation of all of the fundamental principles enshrined in Part I of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe everyone will agree with me that the Constitutional Treaty contains major improvements in terms of consolidating the existing Treaties and merging the pillars, recognising the values on which the European Union is built, giving binding force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and guaranteeing public participation in political life.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, the Constitutional Treaty has sailed on troubled waters. We have the friends of the Constitution, namely the 18 who have ratified it and others for whom ratification would not be a problem. However, we also have friends in trouble: France and the Netherlands. Then we have sceptical friends, the UK, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore we need leadership. Fortunately there is Chancellor Merkel, whom I wholeheartedly trust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need to set up a clear mandate for the IGC leading to a solution before the 2009 elections. The report addresses this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we want the final Treaty to capture the essential substance of the draft Constitution. These are the institutional innovations, the legal personality, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Foreign Service. I do not care so much about symbols.</p>

Making such a request before the Knesset is something that takes a great deal of prior thought.

    <intervention id="3-078" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Javier Solana" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago, the Quartet was meeting in Berlin. Since I am sure that you will have read the document that was made public that same evening, you may be aware of our solidarity with the Members of the Palestinian Authority, of the Parliament, who have been detained and, as the President of this Parliament has quite rightly said, with the other people who have been detained against their will in Israeli or Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement. I have been asked to speak for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes – I shall try to do so I would like to tell you that I have just returned from a long journey throughout the region, and I have been able to meet with the most important regional leaders and to carry out an analysis of the situation so that I could report also to the Quartet, which met last Wednesday.</p>
      <p sl="es">I was pleased to make that trip at more or less the same time as the President of Parliament, with whom I spoke by telephone, and also a distinguished group of MEPs, who have written me a letter to which I have not yet replied. I would like to meet with them personally, because, please believe me, I have not been in Brussels for a single day since then.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall see if I can do so so that I can meet with you to talk calmly about the issues that you have raised, which I believe to be extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that this sitting is of particular importance. It is also being held on a very important date for Palestine, for Israel and for the citizens of the world in general, and of the Arab world in particular.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is currently the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 war, the many tragic consequences of which we are still suffering. When we look at the last forty years, it undoubtedly sends a shudder right through us.</p>
      <p sl="es">They have been forty years of occupation, of suffering on both sides, of violence, during which the citizens – both Palestinians and Israelis – have suffered greatly, and also forty years during which there have been an excess of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="es">Given this forty-year situation, we have two opportunities or ways to look at the situation: to look back in order to try to learn lessons regarding mistakes that must not be repeated or to look forward and try to see whether we can learn the most important lesson of all – that the only solution to this conflict that has now lasted for forty years is peace. A rapid peace process that leads rapidly to peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">There have been many processes, many opportunities for peace have been missed. I believe that we should now all have the will – the will to act, not just the will to think and speak, but the will to act – so that we can truly make peace a reality in those lands that are so dear to many of us and to Europeans in general.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to look forward, but I must make a brief comment on this journey, since the areas that I have visited are all areas which are unfortunately not enjoying the best of times at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the occupied territories, in Palestine, we are witnessing a difficult situation, with violence amongst Palestinians and also renewed violence between Israel and Palestine. The parties’ appeals for a ceasefire have not been heard, either in Palestine or between Palestine and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to send an appeal today to everybody with responsibilities in this area for a ceasefire as soon as possible, so that a favourable climate can be created for progressing towards peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">I had the opportunity to visit Gaza. So did the President of Parliament. Visiting Gaza at the moment is a truly significant experience. This is not the first time I have been to Gaza, but I believe that going there at this point in particular and meeting with the President of the Palestinian Authority was a moral obligation in order not to give the impression that the world has completely forgotten about what is happening in Gaza. Gaza is in a difficult situation, with violence between Palestinians, violence which will lead nowhere if it continues.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first thing we must do is therefore to try to quell that violence, to bring about a ceasefire, so that the Palestinians can finally begin to work together for a common cause, which is of course peace: peace with their neighbours and peace amongst themselves. We are doing everything we can in relation to that policy, both from my position and from the position of the Commission, which is helping generously.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to tell you that the situation in Palestine, from economic and social points of view, is a dramatic one. I therefore believe that, as soon as this period is over and we can meet again with the political leaders in a clearer and more transparent way, we shall have to think about drawing up a special plan of aid for Gaza. Otherwise we may be faced with a truly difficult situation in Gaza, and it will be difficult to recover for the purposes of a genuine peace process.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say that I believe that President Abbas’s solemn appeal yesterday, on the anniversary of the beginning of the 1967 war, deserves to be read and analysed by everybody, because it shows a moral courage that is worthy of note.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say that I was also in Israel. I met with the Prime Minister, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I was also in Sderot, the area suffering the most Kassam rocket attacks. I also felt it appropriate to express our solidarity European solidarity with all of those suffering any kind of violence, including Kassam rocket attacks.</p>
      <p sl="es">It was a difficult and tough place to be, but in any event, experiencing it on the ground gives us a clearer picture of what is happening.</p>
      <p sl="es">In our statement last Wednesday, the members of the Quartet called upon Israel to show restraint.</p>
      <p sl="es">Israel is also experiencing a difficult political situation. The primary elections in the Labour Party are not yet over — they are about to conclude — and we shall see what form the next government takes, if there are any changes, after the elections in the Israeli Labour Party.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say that the Quartet’s statement contains a clear – and vigorous – appeal for Israel to transfer resources to the Palestinian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">The international community can do a lot, and we are doing a lot in fact. We Europeans are probably doing more than anybody.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Arab countries have also started to give money to the Finance Minister, Salam Fallad, and today we can say that the possibility is beginning to emerge of creating a budget for the Palestinian National Authority.</p>
      <p sl="es">Without the transfer of resources from Israel to Palestine, however, there is little else the international community can do. Improving the economic conditions is essentially linked to a transfer of resources from Israel to the Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to make a few brief comments on the Quartet and then on Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the meeting of the Quartet last Wednesday in Berlin was, in my experience – and we have belonged to the Quartet for many years since I participated in setting it up – surely one of the most important meetings we have held so far. It was a Quartet in which we were able to give serious thought to how the peace process can be implemented. If you read the final paragraph of the Statement you will see that it truly looks to the future and commits the members of the Quartet to beginning to work hard, in cooperation with the parties – Israel, Palestine and Arab States – to initiate a peace process, to initiate a process with a political outlook.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to inform you that, for the first time in its history, the Quartet is going to make a joint visit to the region, it is going to hold a meeting over the coming weeks with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and it is also going to hold a meeting with the Arab countries, who I believe, with the Arab peace initiative, are also cooperating in the beginnings of a normalisation of life — or the beginning of the possibility of normalisation — in the territories between Israel and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that, at this time of dejection amongst many people, of dejection amongst the Palestinians and also within a certain sector of Israeli society, the international community, by means of the Quartet, is reacting in the opposite manner: It is reacting with hope, with the sense that, after forty years, we have the moral obligation to make every possible effort to make progress towards the formalisation of peace, towards a peace process.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to you that these coming weeks are going to be absolutely crucial in terms of setting in train a movement that can take us from the current situation to a peace process that leads to peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not so difficult to identify the elements that can lead this process to peace. Almost all of us have a notion of the parameters required in order to achieve peace. What we now need to do is to get to work on it in cooperation with all of the members of the Quartet. I would like to stress that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the US Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister were very cooperative with regard to our proposal, and they expressed clear support for the ideas that it was my privilege to present to the Quartet on Europe’s behalf.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore at an extremely significant crossroads, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of the situation on the ground, but also a positive crossroads in terms of moving towards a peace process that we can begin to see sketched out on the horizon.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot let this speaking time that the Presidency has allowed me to go by without saying a few words about Lebanon. Lebanon is once again in a situation of profound crisis. The honourable Members are well aware of this. These are moments of profound significance, and some of them have been going on for some time. From the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri, the whole situation that they experienced over the summer, the current situation of political paralysis, which has become even more serious with the movements that have emerged, with acts of terrorism, in the refugee camps, in two refugee camps, specifically: one in the north and the other in the south.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know, the Lebanese army has reacted in a way that I would describe as patriotic, and the support for the Lebanese army from all of Lebanon's political factions has also been patriotic, which is truly extraordinary given the differences that have existed amongst them over recent months, weeks and days.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also hope and pray that peace will also come to Lebanon, and that the special circumstances that have arisen over recent days — which were also accompanied by the United Nations Security Council’s approval of the International Criminal Court to try the crimes that were committed in Lebanon — will make it possible to reach an agreement amongst all of the political forces in order to unblock the political process in Lebanon. That is what we want, and we are cooperating in the best possible to way in order to see it come about.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I shall remain within the speaking time available to me and I would like to end by reiterating what I said at the beginning: we have a moment of hope, a moment that we must be able to exploit, which in one way or another must complete the circle that was begun forty years ago and which we hope to see completed by means of peace, by means of a life lived together by two States — Israel and Palestine. That peace must include the other countries — Syria, Lebanon — so that we can see the re-emergence of a Middle East that can offer more hope to everybody, which is prosperous and which makes a constructive contribution to peace throughout the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">We Europeans cannot close our eyes to this task and you may rest assured that mine at least will always be open.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we all know and as Mr Solana has just said, the atmosphere in the region is extremely tense. I would even say that there is even a sense of despair. My director is still there and he has just called me. Unfortunately, security has deteriorated and we are witnessing a vicious circle of violence, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in Israel and in Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the causes of this despair are not addressed, we may very soon witness the consolidation of more radical groups throughout the region. I think this is the great danger there. In Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said, fighting has now spread to other Palestinian camps. We are therefore deeply concerned that the confrontation between the Lebanese armed forces and the Islamist insurgents is there. This has turned out to be the most serious internal conflict since the end of the civil war and has already cost over 100 human lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress once again our full support for the legitimate government of Lebanon. I would, however, repeat our position that everything possible has to be done to avoid further casualties among the civilian population. The relief agencies must be able to carry out their work.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, I would also like to express my satisfaction with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1757, which secures the establishment of a special tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. I think this will allow the people of Lebanon to affirm respect for the law and the rule of law in their country and to turn a page on one of the most tragic events in Lebanon’s recent history.</p>
      <p sl="en">The meeting due to take place in Gaza tomorrow between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert has unfortunately been cancelled, but at least the leaders of the G8 will tomorrow be tackling the issue of the Palestine-Israeli conflict, as we did at the G8 Foreign Ministers’ meeting. There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel, but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and, on the other hand, to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even at this very delicate and difficult time, we believe that there is still some reason for hope, because the Israeli initiative is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive solution. We know that the Egyptians too are trying to broker a ceasefire with all the Palestinian factions. US involvement, particularly the involvement of Condoleezza Rice, is very valuable at this difficult time. Our EU Presidency is also very committed. The Quartet has done exactly as Mr Solana has said, I think it was a very good meeting and the idea is there for both the bilateral track and the regional track. Hopefully the meeting can come about in Egypt with Arab League interlocutors and hopefully also with the two parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Mr Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib, who is planning, with his Egyptian counterpart, to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June. We hope that this will help to further engage Israel and encourage it to respond positively to the Arab peace initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week I also attended a conference in Vienna on the role of women leaders as contributors to peace and security in the Middle East. Prominent women, such as Tzipi Livni, Hanan Ashrawi, Condoleezza Rice and others, discussed the potential contribution of civil society, of women in society, to peace. Even if it is a small contribution, this was the first time that Tzipi Livni and Hanan Ashrawi had held discussions at the same table. I must say that there was quite a lot of mutual understanding and there was even a friendly atmosphere. The initiative proved to be another useful part of this very difficult process. I plan to organise some sort of follow-up meeting in Brussels, perhaps next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">We very much appreciate the European Parliament’s involvement: the visit by the EP Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council was followed by your visit, Mr President, and by your very balanced speech in the Knesset on 30 May. It is encouraging that the speech, as you said, was quite well received by the Knesset. This is not an easy opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Palestinian people desperately need a political perspective. We, the members of the Quartet, are all clear on that. This is why we must press for negotiations on a final status issue, cooperating with the structures set up by the Arab League. The Arab League asked Israel to free certain measures also related to the occupation, for instance the settlements and the separation barrier. I was very encouraged by President Abbas’s call for an immediate end to this internal violence, because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all. The ceasefire should indeed be extended to the West Bank. I very much regret that tomorrow’s meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas had to be cancelled, but we apparently have to realise that the two sides could not reach agreement on Abbas’s plan for a ceasefire, in particular on linking the ceasefire in Gaza with the cessation of military operations in the West Bank. No agreement was possible, either, on unfreezing Palestinian clearance revenues withheld by Israel before the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit. We had hoped for some movement on this. The Palestinians decided that they could not risk this meeting, but of course we had all hoped that this would give a little more progress on the dialogue on the ceasefire, progress on the transfer of revenues and on movement of access.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the National Unity Government, in my opinion now is certainly not the time to give up on it. I can agree that it has not yet delivered everything we were hoping for, but there are no attractive alternatives. If we allow this Government to crumble, the implications for the institutions of the Palestinian Authority are very grave and radical splinter groups may be strengthened as a result. I think this is the last result we would want.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, within the limits set by the Council of Ministers, the Commission has responded quickly to the National Unity Government and to the increased needs of the Palestinians. In the first half of 2007 alone, we committed EUR 320 million of Community funds, which almost equals the total amount of funds committed last year. This exceptional effort shows that, since the formation of the National Unity Government, we have stepped up our emergency assistance to the Palestinians. But the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority is extremely grave, as Salam Fayyad told my colleague yesterday. They still need us to go on even with this mechanism. Israel must release the withheld clearance revenue to the Palestinian Authority. I think we therefore will have to go on encouraging them to do so via the temporary international mechanism or through the PLO account. We reiterated this request at the last Association Committee with Israel in Jerusalem on 4 June. The Quartet has also noted the importance of the resumption of transfers to improve economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza. As I said, movement is of course essential in any case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the formation of this National Unity Government, we have been working very closely with the Minister of Finance. Because the socio-economic situation is so dire, we will extend the TIM until 30 September and we must look for fresh funds for this new extension. I will soon ask the European Parliament and the Council to make another effort and to find additional resources in the budget. I thank you for whatever you have given as support in the past and do hope that this support will also be extended to us in the future, because our priority task should be to help restore the institutions of the Palestinian authority so that it can then deliver services to the Palestinian people. We are trying gradually to shift towards a resumption of institution-building and development projects, and to decrease our current concentration on emergency and humanitarian aid if we can do so – of course, this condition is still there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We look forward to new Palestinian proposals. They said they would come up with ideas for specific international support. The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities, particularly in Gaza, that we could support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that the financial deficit of the Palestinian Authority is so large that it would be impossible for the Community to shoulder the burden alone. Arab States also have to deliver on their commitments to help the National Unity Government. I was encouraged to see that the PLO account established now was at least used by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. This will help but it is not sufficient.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the High Representative for his tireless efforts in the quest for peace, and you yourself, Mr President, for your visit to the region, for its symbolism and the solidarity it demonstrated; and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for the immense job that the European Commission is doing in the midst of a serious political crisis, with the factions making up the Government of National Unity now in confrontation and in the midst of an extremely serious social, economic and humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">What can be done in this situation? Little more than what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana have told us, I believe: to redouble the European Union’s diplomatic efforts and to act on the basis of two premises.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is a halt to the internal fighting between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, which are waging a vicious battle for power, which is having a dramatic effect on the civilian population.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Mr President – and we must also state this very clearly – a permanent and explicit commitment from the Government of National Unity to democracy and the renunciation of violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">What can we do in the meantime, Mr President? Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has explained it very clearly: to try to apply the humanitarian aid mechanism as flexibly as possible, to increase the sums allocated to it and to redistribute it amongst the other priorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the maximum sentence according to my country’s Penal Code is thirty years and one day. Mr Solana reminded us today that it is forty years since the Six Day War, which led to the occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights. And the situation remains stagnant and bogged down. Forty years of suffering and death is more than a society – or two societies, as Mr Solana pointed out – can tolerate.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this Parliament must respond in a united fashion in support of the representatives of the Council and the Commission so that the European Union, within the international community in general and the Quartet in particular, can do everything possible to bring about — as Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have said — a new opportunity for peace for a society and a region that has already suffered too much.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, as has been pointed out, this debate is taking place on the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. What was supposed to be a lightning strike has turned into a never-ending nightmare: 40 years is such a long time that entire generations of Palestinians have never known anything but occupation, humiliation, checkpoints and then the wall and almost total imprisonment. Movement is now all but impossible in the occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="it">Over these 40 years, Israel has certainly not found the guarantees of security that it was looking for, either, and it has experienced worrying erosions of democracy and the rule of law. These are two peoples exhausted by endless war and violence. For our part, we would like to emphasise – as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly – that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peace-keeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further, to re-establish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected, and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">From Israel we expect gestures other than the murders and indiscriminate arrests that came in response to the Qassam rocket strikes on Sderot. The occupation, the settlements, the wall and the status of Jerusalem are making the prospect of a two-State solution more unlikely every day, as even United Nations sources are now saying. The United Nations, the United States, Russia, Europe and the entire international community have a responsibility to act before all chances of coexistence are gone for ever.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I would remind you that there is an Arab plan that offers Israel a prospect of peace, not only with the Palestinians but with Arab countries as a whole. That is something that needs addressing with more conviction. Prime Minister Olmert himself said the other day that that plan could provide a basis for negotiations. I hope he did not say so just because his government is particularly weak.</p>
      <p sl="it">The situation in Lebanon is equally serious, as you have pointed out. I believe that the UNIFIL forces on the ground should be supported and reinforced. Lastly, we should like to call on President Poettering to take steps to call an extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, around this time, we commemorate the Six-Day War, which, on the one hand, established Israel’s military supremacy, but which also ushered in the start of the occupation, confrontations, violence and endless bloodshed that have lasted 40 years. Anyone in Israel who was born in the Occupied Territories after June 1967, in other words anyone who is 40 years or younger, has known nothing but uncertainty and anxiety about the future of their own country, their loved ones and their own lives. After 40 years, it is really time to say enough is enough. Peace should now be brokered as a matter of urgency: sustainable peace, on the basis that two countries recognise each other’s right to exist and need to be left alone by their neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All previous speakers have taken great pains to explain how complicated, difficult and complex this is but, ladies and gentlemen, there is one ingredient without which it will never work, namely political will and political courage. Without the kind of political will and political courage that was evident at one time in South Africa, for example, in both camps, to end apartheid – a brutal regime – it will not work. The unfortunate thing is that nobody can have political will and political courage for the protagonists. It is they themselves who will need to muster this political will and this political courage. Tomorrow, a human chain of Jews and Palestinians will be formed around the Berlaymont building who will all say together: ‘After 40 years, we have really had enough. After 40 years, we must work on peace.’</p>
      <p sl="nl">Sadly, though, the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not the only one fermenting trouble in the region. Fresh violence has flared up in Lebanon, in which some see the hand of Syria, which wants to avoid an international Hariri tribunal at all costs. On behalf of my group, I should like to welcome the decision by the UN Security Council, which has had the courage to say that such a tribunal will be set up. As you know, this will be a mixed tribunal, involving both international and Lebanese judges and a mixed public prosecution, which will function according to the principles of Lebanese law. In Lebanon, too, though, political courage will be needed in all camps finally to give the Lebanese what they are entitled to as well: peace and security.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today. Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time, I shall concentrate on Palestine, because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967, after the start of the Six-Day War, it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a two-state solution. Forty years later, the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals: to bring people around to this way of thinking.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine, which sent out the wrong signal, allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say ‘There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money’. That is why it was so important, as the Commissioner rightly said, that funding was restored through the emergency mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">That work must continue, because only by building relations and building dialogue between the peoples can we guarantee that there will be a resolution. That resolution must be predicated on the same principles as 40 years ago: a two-state solution, a guarantee of secure borders and justice and equity for all peoples in Israel and in Palestine.</p>

      <p sl="es">Israel won the Six Day War, but it has lost the peace with forty years of occupation. We are now seeing a dangerous tendency towards the Iraqisation and tribalisation of violence in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="es">The emergence of Fatah al-Islam in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the increasing fragmentation of the civil conflicts in Gaza do not bode well for the future of the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are seeing the impact of the Palestinian problem spreading throughout the Middle East and becoming mixed up with the interests of the different players.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are running the risk of hitting rock bottom very soon. Are we going to wait around doing nothing until the Palestinian Authority collapses? As I have said, we cannot allow that to happen. How can we ensure that it will not? Is the chaos and violence of war by everybody against everybody a ‘death foretold’?</p>
      <p sl="es">Gaza cannot wait any longer. The European Union cannot carry on turning its back on the democratically-elected Government of National Unity. This European policy has contributed to the popular discrediting of any hint of moderation on the part of Hamas and Fatah, because it demonstrates that the acceptance of the Mecca Agreement does nothing to change the embargo or improve the terrible living conditions in the huge prison known as Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties, including Hamas, in order to promote a stable unity government.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, we must restore direct financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and ensure that Israel returns the money from Palestinian taxes that it is keeping.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, we must work to extend the Gaza ceasefire to the West Bank, with the creation of international guarantees, sending European and Arab troops under a UN mandate to Gaza and, if necessary, to the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, we are calling for the release of the forty-five Members of Parliament and of the Israeli Gilad Shalit and for a halt to the launching of Kassam rockets and Israel’s devastating responses.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, my group was very keen to hold this debate, particularly today, 40 years after the start of a war to which the international community, including the European Union, has shown itself to this day incapable of imposing the only just and lasting solution, that is, an end to the occupation, to the colonisation, to the oppression by Israel of the Palestinian territories conquered in 1967.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcomed, in their form and substance, the strong words you spoke about this in the Knesset on 30 May. I particularly remember three key sentences from your speech. You stated that, ‘international law is binding on us all’. You are right. We ask no more of Israel than that it should respect the Security Council resolutions, the Geneva Conventions, the opinions of the International Court of Justice and humanitarian law, as the United Nations Organisation (UNO) has just pointed out. The violations of the law are flagrant, constant and massive. They are in relation to settlements, refugees, prisoners, the wall and, primarily of course, the occupation of the territories and the annexation of East Jerusalem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have also pointed out, Mr President, that, I quote: ‘a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders is and remains the only way to a satisfactory solution’. It is a fundamental truth. The multiplication of settlements, the construction of the wall, the isolation of Palestinian areas of Jerusalem, however, serve precisely to make this solution impossible. The Israeli authorities’ disregard for the Arab League’s peace plan confirms this strategy of making things worse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have rightly reminded us, Mr President, of this obvious fact: there is no peace without justice. The famous Israeli historian, Tom Segev, recently echoed the thoughts of those of his compatriots who, for 40 years, have believed that, I quote, ‘in 1967, Israel laid the foundations for future terrorism’. Great men of State, such as Yitzhak Rabin, understood this, but the Israeli peace forces, who are a credit to that country, are marginalised by the current regime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The conclusion to be drawn from this tragic experience of 40 years of blindness is, in the opinion of my group, as follows: laisser faire amounts to us making ourselves guilty. Let us dare to stand up for truth. I quote your words one last time, Mr President, you said, ‘let us have the courage to make a new start together’.</p>

      <p sl="en">High Representative for CFSP. Mr President, I should very briefly like to reply to the contributions from the honourable Members representing the different political groups in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that most of the speeches followed a line which is in a sense the same one that we have been defending for a long time: namely, the time has come to move on from the policy of crisis management – which is very important, but it is not enough. We need policies, together with crisis management, to solving the conflict. We need to work towards a political horizon to really begin to get into the business of solving the conflict that started 40 years ago. That is basically the view everybody has expressed, and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days.</p>
      <p sl="en">I told you that last Wednesday the Quartet met in Berlin, and I said that for the first time the Quartet is committed to starting a debate with the parties in order to begin to work towards a political horizon. This means that, before the end of this month, the Quartet will meet with the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push forward the dialogue – which is still in its preliminary stages – that has begun between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. They are the two people who must find the way towards peace. It is our obligation to push and to provide a catalyst for this process. That is what we are going to do. It is written very clearly in the statement produced by the Quartet last Wednesday. I think that this is a profound change, and I would like to underline that, because someone asked whether we are going wait passively for a catastrophe to arrive. The answer is no: we do not want to do that; you do not want to do that; the people in the region do not want to do that. Therefore, under the leadership of the Quartet, we are trying to put forward this mechanism in order to move towards peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few other ideas were put forward by some of the honourable Members representing the political groups, including the suggestion of an international force. I would like to say that, for the first time in many years, the idea of an international force is not out of the question. As you know, the idea was brought up in the Knesset by two members of the parliamentary groups, saying that this may be the time to call for an international force, at least at the beginning, in a peacekeeping role or to control the border in the south – the so-called ‘Philadelphi Corridor’ – where the Rafah Crossing is situated. We are working on that, as you probably know, because information has already been published. The Israelis are also considering that possibility, as are the Palestinians. The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity. For the Egyptians it would probably be very difficult to have an international force there, as it may give the impression that they are not able to control that part of the border. However, I think that we can still begin discussions on these issues and perhaps eventually reach a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">This also ties in with what Mrs Napoletano said about the success of UNIFIL. The fact that the international force has been responsible for UNIFIL – i.e. for the application of the UN Security Council resolution on Lebanon – and the manner in which it has been perceived – i.e. the efficiency of the force, of which the backbone is European – have also caused some in the Israeli Government, the Knesset and Israel as a whole to think that it might be possible for a force of that nature also to be applied elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a way, we have to link all the issues together. It may be possible for us to use what we have learned from our presence in Lebanon in another place. That opens the way to a monitoring presence which will be absolutely necessary if we want the peace process to come to fruition.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress again that, as regards Lebanon, the resolution creating the tribunal is very important. The tribunal is not against anybody. There has been a very negative reaction in Syria, but I must stress that an international tribunal is not against anybody, any country. It is a tribunal that is organised in order to see who is responsible for the killing of a good man – a friend of many of ours, Mr Hariri – who was assassinated in a manner that has to be clarified if we want peace and reconciliation in Lebanon. Therefore we in the European Union have been working towards this, and last Wednesday the Security Council came to another important decision on setting up an international tribunal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say once again that what we have striven to do in taking the Quartet in the direction that we are now moving is something that has many fathers – or many mothers – as always, but you can be sure that the Europeans have been working very hard from the very beginning to arrive at this moment. Let us hope that we are able to continue working in that direction. It will be difficult, but for the future I hope to have the support, help and understanding of the European Parliament, as always.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, yesterday I met a delegation of Israeli citizens from Sderot who related to me first-hand the terror in their civilian population from 300 random Qassam rocket attacks launched at them from Hamas-controlled sites in Gaza, which clearly constitutes a war crime in international law, with two dead and many injured to date. Last week 33 people were detained by the IDF in the West Bank, including the Palestinian Education Minister Nasser al-Shaer, allegedly for their overt support for these rocket attacks. The detention of an education minister is interesting as it tends to support the repeated allegations in this House that the Palestinian textbooks and school curriculum supported for years by EU funds are still aimed at fomenting a climate of hatred and distrust for Israel and a glorification of terrorist violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of the Hamas ministerial components of the Unity Government – like the Hamas 1988 Charter inspired by Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood – still believe strongly that the State of Israel has no right to exist, that all terrorist violence is justified through so-called armed struggle, and that they are not bound by previous PLO-signed international agreements. Therefore, in my view at present the PA Unity Government clearly does not comply with the Quartet criteria, and the EU must not yet lift the ban on Hamas as a designated terrorist organisation, or directly fund the PA Government. Neither should the TIM be abandoned for the delivery of humanitarian aid, which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen over the last three years, contrary to popular opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I too support the Arab League’s new proposals for a negotiated solution, although the right of return is totally unrealistic. But again, and curiously, Hamas rejects their proposals for Israel’s recognition. Some hardliners on all sides reject peace or a two-state solution, but on the 40th anniversary of the six-day war it is clear that this is the only viable long-term solution for a lasting peace in the region. But first the PA must ensure law and order on its territory and stop the dissent into virtual Hamas-Fatah civil war in Gaza, which is also being stirred up in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again I would like to call upon the House and the international community to put pressure on all those responsible for the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston, who we now know is alive and well, and the kidnapped soldier Corporal Shalit. This will create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks.</p>

    <intervention id="3-091" speaker_id="22097" name="Véronique De Keyser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, at the time of the legislative elections in 2006, I asked a Palestinian: ‘Do you think that these elections will bring peace?’ He replied: ‘No, not peace, but democracy. And we are going to show the world that, even in the occupied territories, we are capable of holding free elections’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our response was pathetic. Our disregard for the aspirations of a people, including their right to make mistakes, introduced just a bit more chaos still into a region that is now in ferment. The establishment of a National Unity Government and the Mecca Agreement have not sufficiently altered the European Union’s hard line or its sanctions. Despite your efforts, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – and I appreciate those efforts – in spite of what you have said to us, and it is encouraging, Mr Solana, I believe that we have not yet radically changed our policy towards the Middle East and that we have not properly understood that we are damaging the very notion of democracy with our response to these elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is an attitude that has persisted for 40 years. I believe that we are partly responsible for having allowed, for 40 years, a situation of total lawlessness to take hold in Palestine, with extra-judicial executions, theft of land, kidnapping, now, of legitimately elected representatives and ministers, the existence of a wall considered illegal by the Court in The Hague and the Geneva Conventions flouted, Francis Wurtz spoke about it: more than 400 children still held in Israeli prisons, more than 400 young Palestinians. The United Nations Organisation (UNO) resolutions ignored the sealing off of territories and restrictions on movements. And what else?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, Mr Tannock, we condemn violence, we condemn the firing of rockets, we condemn the kidnapping of the soldier, Shalit, but there is at present an imbalance. Look at the figures. They are, alas, dramatically unfavourable to the Palestinian people and, I repeat, there is no equidistance. International law – that is not equidistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nothing today justifies our silence and I should like to salute, here, these new Just Men, those Jews who, in Israel and elsewhere, speak out and say ‘That must be stopped’. They say it amid the sniggering, the sarcasm, and sometimes the threats of their fellow citizens. I see myself as a supporter of all those people, as I see myself as a supporter of our Palestinian colleagues who, regardless of parliamentary immunity, have been imprisoned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say to you that in Belgium, all the leaders of the political parties are to meet tomorrow, at 1 p.m. at Berlaymont, to make a chain for peace and to ask the European Union to take on its responsibilities, not only humanitarian responsibilities, but real political responsibilities which are a credit to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us questions Israel’s right to exist. We are aware of our political responsibility. At the same time, I would like to remind the House of the message from a peace conference held in Palestine in the last few days. Women, who are, after all, part of civil society, Palestinian and Israeli women, delivered a clear message to us. You speak, they said, of the coexistence of two states. That is good, but please take note that our existence is threatened in Palestine and in Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the crux of the matter at this time is the existence issue. For this reason I am glad that Javier Solana said we had to consider whether we should not review the Lebanon experience as quickly as possible and possibly become involved in Gaza. We must act before the situation slides completely out of control, because there will not be many more opportunities. What you described as courage, Dr Solana, namely the hope we must have if we are to remain committed and explain our commitment to the people on the ground too, that hope has faded to a shadow in the region itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish to thank Mr Poettering on behalf of my group for having made that journey. You said that the situation in Gaza is intolerable. It is our duty to become more heavily committed than ever before to the right of people there to live in peace, and of course that also means criticising Hamas for its duplicity. The statement made by Hamas to mark the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War is unacceptable in our view. At the same time, however, we must cooperate actively with the Government of National Unity. We shall not get a second chance. I second the criticism voiced by Mrs De Keyser just a few moments ago. We in the European Union have indeed made mistakes in that region. We have bitterly disappointed people’s hopes and have failed to harness their willingness to look to the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the Middle East Quartet is now roused from slumber. I hope it will go into action, and I hope there will be trips to the region. It may be a last chance before we can no longer speak realistically of any hope of peace.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to begin with some quotes. On 2 April, Prime Minister Haniyeh said on Al-Jazeera: ‘As far as we are concerned, the issue of recognition of Israel has been settled once and for all. It has been settled in our political literature, in our Islamic thought and in our Jihadist culture, on which we base our moves. We will declare a truce, but never recognition of Israel’. On Al-Jazeera on 27 April, he said: ‘If the siege continues beyond a certain time, we will be forced to make a decision and there is no doubt that we will act’. On 5 May, in a prayer, he said: ‘I reiterate, on behalf of the Palestinian Government, that the security plan will not hurt the resistance. We will give Allah the opportunity to grant us one of the two mercies, victory or martyrdom’.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a fluent speaker of Arabic, I can assure you that the translation is correct. The situation is grave. We face not only the ‘Iraqisation’ of Gaza but the ‘Iranisation’ of the whole Middle East. This is not just a threat to the Middle East. This is a serious threat to our own security. Europe must be a player and we must be absolutely unified. Therefore Parliament should remain unified, supporting the Council, the Commission and the Quartet. The Temporary International Mechanism must go on. We have to continue humanitarian aid. We may even use the PLO account.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the key issue is to bring the Palestinian National Unity Government to renounce violence, to recognise Israel and to honour international agreements. Only then can we return to UN Resolution 242, clearly asking Israel to withdraw from territories, so that there are no ‘deterritories’ or occupied territories. I therefore ask the Council and the Commission whether they consider that the preconditions for the recognition and direct financing of the Palestinian National Unity Government have been met.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, when 40 years have passed since the Six Day War and the nations of the Middle East are still suffering now from its tragic consequences; when reports by Amnesty International and the United Nations now seriously question the viability of a Palestinian state because of the persistent Israeli policies of occupation and colonisation; when unbearable misery is rife in Gaza and on the West Bank, feeding the fire between rival Palestinian factions, and the National Unity Government, the last rampart against civil war, is hanging by a thread; when the whole region is in ferment from Iraq to Lebanon, we can say that compassionate speeches are no longer enough and it is urgent to bring about change, an upheaval, a revolution, dare I say, in our Middle East policy and to take on the full extent of our responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, by recognising the Palestinian National Unity Government on which we have pinned our hopes and which has declared willingness to respect all of the UN and PLO resolutions, all of the previous resolutions, as well as the demands of the Quartet to restore credibility to the two-state solution. Next, by reinstating our direct aid to this government, because it is unrealistic to count on the Israelis to release the tax revenues that were collected by right and which remain confiscated and because the temporary mechanism has fizzled out. Furthermore, by deploying an international interposition force at the border between Gaza and Israel, the only measure that is likely to bring about a ceasefire the effectiveness and endurance of which have been demonstrated in Lebanon. Finally and above all, by showing considerable ambition, perhaps, by taking the initiative for a European Camp David that has become necessary since the roadmap brandished by the Quartet comes down to nothing more than a pious hope.</p>

      <p sl="da">Thank you, Mr President, and thanks also to the Commissioner and the High Representative. Simply put, however, I have my doubts. We, in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have attempted to discuss amongst ourselves what it is we have learnt here. It is a top priority for us that we now recognise the Palestinian Government and that action be taken again. I am quite simply unable to tell whether that is what we have been told is to happen. It was not what Mr Solana told us; but was it what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said? That is – did she say that we would now grant recognition and go on from there? It seems to me that we need a clear answer to this question because what frustrates the whole system is the fact that all we get is endless talk and no action. The double standards and the paralysis of action are on the point of wrecking not only the Middle East but also the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">The other matter about which we need clarity is what is meant by the fact that we are now to support the Arab initiative. I was unable to conclude from Mr Solana’s presentation that this is actually what we intend to do. All I could make out was that it was said that we must now engage again in negotiation. We are well aware, however, of where we need to go. It is a difficult process to turn this into a reality, but we know what has to be brought about, and we cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for mentioning the Arab initiative over and over and then letting all the steam out of it by saying ‘now let us see what happens’. We need to say that this is the point at which we are making a start. We have, set out before us, the final result that we are all well aware is the only acceptable outcome if we are to make progress and that, to top it all, is what both the West and Israel have long been calling for. It has suddenly been put on the table. Can we not have clear answers? That would be nice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, the fact that the Quartet now intends to act jointly in the region is good news. That is an important message, because, as we have often said in this House, it is only through concerted action that the Quartet acquires the credibility it needs to be able to give all parties the essential security guarantees. In the eyes of the region, no member of the Quartet can do that on its own. May I congratulate you on this development and also on the fact that it can be combined with the Arab initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to advance – and we have discussed this so often – and avoid giving in to hopelessness and despair, we must be clear about one thing: the moderates on both sides must be able to create conditions in their own territories in which the foundations can be built for a peace process that will not be demolished by the provocations of the extremist minorities on the other side. This must therefore be the starting point. It is true, of course, that Israel must release the money. It is also true that this patchwork situation in the West Bank, with checks and settlements everywhere, which nips any economic development in the bud, must be ended, and that conditions must prevail in which economic development is possible again. We can pump as much money into the West Bank as we like, but the right conditions simply must be created there.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must also be said, however, that what is happening in Gaza is a civil war between Palestinians. The answer is not an international force deployed between Israel and Gaza but meetings between the warring factions to bring about a satisfactory end to the conflict. All of these issues are plainly interconnected, but please let us remember that everyone is responsible for his own domain. We cannot take over this responsibility. Accordingly, we must demand an end to the civil war. Anyone trying to resolve conflicts between the rival groups by military means is destroying the future prospects of his own people. For this reason we must take care to seek our starting points here and thus create a platform from which the Quartet can operate successfully and give us a genuine chance of progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, sometimes I get very dispirited when listening to the debates in this House on this issue, particularly when I hear Mr Tannock and Mrs Hybášková, who seem intent on laying down conditions in this House for a solution in the Middle East. It is not for us to set preconditions for the Israelis and the Palestinians in terms of how they will address each other in the peace negotiations. The only preconditions necessary for successful peace negotiations are a demonstrable commitment to peace on each side, a mandate to negotiate on each side and the capacity to deliver on the commitments made in the negotiations. All other preconditions which MEPs in this House seek to apply to Israelis and Palestinians are so much hot air. They have no effect and there is no possible likelihood that they will be met in a situation in which the Palestinian Authority, in particular, is at the point of collapse. If that Authority, that Unity Government, collapses, then nothing we say and nothing the European Union does will prevent the appalling bloodbath that will follow, for the Israelis and for the Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="en">The role of the international community is to ensure that the patrons of each side in this conflict – the Quartet and the Arab States – set aside their immediate short-term interests and put the interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis first. We must seek to ensure that they come to the table and address the outlines that are already there, and which have been for some time, as regards the possibilities and conditions for peace. It is time we stopped talking and started to act in the interests …</p>

      <p sl="sk">() As Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have told us, the situation in the Middle East is indeed critical. The situation is critical in Lebanon, and it continues to be critical in Palestinian-Israeli relations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The very notion of 'critical', however, is dramatic, since it implies a situation of financial, economic and social decline, accompanied by terror attacks and activities, kidnappings and the death of civilians. The mounting resistance and attacks against the state of Israel and her citizens breed fear and concern, resulting in measures which we find incomprehensible. The region is a mess, conflict is intensifying and the ceasefire is not being abided by. The meeting of the Quartet last week pointed out that our active involvement in the peace process was essential. However, the degree of frustration on either side, be it Palestinian or Israeli, is just as great as our endeavours to further the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is imperative, therefore, to beef up our diplomatic efforts, to make them more dynamic and, in particular, to make them balanced. Our activities should not generate the impression that we stand on one side of the conflict. It is our duty to demand that Israel release the funds; by the same token, it is our duty to ensure that the funds are indeed invested in economic and social development. It is also our duty to guarantee for the citizens of Israel basic protection of their lives and the basic defence of their state.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This issue of the Middle East, and in particular the tragic situation in Palestine, has resurfaced several times in recent plenary sessions. This should come as no surprise. We have all seen on the ground what goes on there. We have all seen the same thing, we have come to Parliament and reported a terrible and explosive humanitarian situation. We have all seen Israel’s illegal retention of some EUR 700 million in taxes – money that does not belong to Israel and that is generating interest by the day. We have all seen in the eyes of those people – human beings with the right to justice and dignity just like us – the hope for a future in which they can live in peace. This is a hope that remains alive despite the constraints, a hope that every day is severely put to the test by a lack of mobility and by the wall. This is a wall that puts paid to any kind of local economy, either in its purest meaning of subsistence through farming, or in terms of something more ambitious like having enough produce to run a small shop.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the face of the continuous erosion of that hope, despair takes hold and, as members of this privileged club of countries that won peace after enduring the bitter taste of war, we must not think that we can solve problems by throwing money at them. Helping the Palestinian people is very important, crucial in fact. Much more important, though, is helping them realise that their voice makes a difference in their country and that the credible manner in which they ran their elections and sought a solution to present to the world counted for something. Authority must be restored to the Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us hope that Finance Minister Salam Fayad can become one of the main spokesmen on matters of financial help to the people. It is therefore vital to normalise institutional relations. We must demonstrate that we are actually prepared to resolve the conflict. We Europeans have a vital part to play in bringing peace to the region and to the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we must give peace a chance in the Middle East. We know how difficult it is and we all know about the challenges, but we all know about the new hopes and we have clearly explained the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is necessary is, on the one hand, to achieve a certain level of security, and a better security situation first to the Palestinians within Gaza, but also in the West Bank. That is very true. Both we and Americans are working with the Palestinians to come to such a solution, but unfortunately we are not yet completely there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, there needs to be greater economic freedom in order to improve the daily lives of the Palestinians. This is also what we are trying to do. We also said very clearly that we want to engage with this national Unity Government according to the actions and the programme. Salam Fayyad is, therefore, our preferred interlocutor to see what else can be done. I have very clearly said what could be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to repeat to you that in addition to from our continuous work with the temporary international mechanism – that I would have liked to phase out as soon as possible, but I cannot do so because there humanitarian assistance is still necessary – we offered Salam Fayyad technical assistance in the area of audit, revenue collection and customs. We are currently working with the Ministry to define the delivery of assistance, but we are also resuming institution-building where it is important.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are trying to go for development assistance in order to give more hope to the population, but it is true that a lot of political courage and political will is necessary, first and foremost on the part of the parties to the conflict. we members of the Quartet can only support them, we can push them, we can encourage them and this is what we are trying to do, but we cannot, unfortunately, take the decision for them. That is the limit of our action. I hope that the next meeting in the region will be a positive one and will be the trigger to this political vision and political horizon that we all have so much in our minds.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope and plead for the release of all the political prisoners. That means the abducted Israeli soldier and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston, but also all the members of the Palestinian government and all the others that are still imprisoned. I think this would be very good momentum that could be brought about in order to find the next steps towards this two-state solution that we all so clearly wish for.</p>

      <p sl="en">High Representative for CFSP. Mr President, I am not going to repeat what I and others who have contributed to the debate have already said.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would first of all like to thank all the Members of Parliament who contributed, those who are still here and those who have left. I think it has been a very interesting debate, and I would like to make an observation on it. When I come to the European Parliament to discuss the Middle East, I have the feeling that emotions run high, starting with my own. But I think that our debates have to be about the events which are important at a given time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we are in a very difficult situation, but at the same time, as has been said, it is a time of hope, which did not exist for a long time. I have been involved in the Middle East for many years. I was at the Madrid Conference and at the last Conference at Camp David. Not since Camp David have I perceived us to be any closer than I feel we are today to the beginning of real, meaningful communication and exchange and therefore the beginning of a political horizon, and a debate and negotiations about that. There are three reasons for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">One is that the Arab League Initiative is something that was missing at the time of Camp David. We have it today, and we have the engagement of the Arabs to embrace whoever the Palestinian negotiator is going to be, in order to sustain him and to give the support which, as you know, was not there at the time of Camp David.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, 40 years have elapsed. I think everybody is exhausted: psychologically, physically and politically. Out of this exhaustion I think that we have to muster new psychological and political energy in order to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we have a mechanism – the Quartet – and sometimes we do not realise how much effort goes into that. For the first time we have the United States and the European Union at the same table negotiating with the parties, which has never happened before. We have to recognise that. This is the first time that the European Union has been at the negotiating table. The Russian Federation was in Madrid and then disappeared. There was also the Secretary-General of the United Nations – imagine for a moment what that means – the United Nations negotiated in this conflict. It was impossible to imagine at that time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that to a certain extent all these elements change the horizon of what can be done now. We must now try to move on, try not to falter and try to continue working in that direction. Conditions have changed and therefore we have more hope that it can be achieved. Will it be achieved in 24 hours? No. If you think that we will find the solution to all the problems by the end of this month, you are wrong: we will have to wait a bit longer than that. But let us see whether we have the opportunity to move the process forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a final thought, I would like to stress that we are Europeans here. Everyone here is a member of the European Union. Sometimes we have to be a little proud of what we do. If you go to Palestine, as you do, you hear the criticism. But probably, if you really talk in depth to the Palestinians and Israelis, you will find a growing sympathy and understanding – you have to agree with me about that – for the way in which Europeans are doing things. I think that we Europeans have to recognise that every now and then. Otherwise we will never move forward collectively, as we need to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving this process forward is not an effort for one or two: it is an effort for everybody. We have an opportunity. Let us see whether next time we meet we see progress. We will not see the solution, but let us see whether we make progress.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Six Day War took place in 1967 and it had its winner. In the last 40 years the loser has been human dignity. The humanitarian crisis in the Middle East is one of the most tragic in recent history. There is a vicious circle of violence in the region which no one has yet been able to break. Generations of Israelis and Palestinians have lived with instability, violence and war.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Crisis management has been the tool used in practice to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict. Step by step the aim has been a move towards permanent peace. A ceasefire has been reached which will soon have collapsed and a new conflict begun.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is difficult to believe in a successful path as long as the parties fail to understand that each act of violence destroys the future of a section of its own people. There is also a lack of comprehension among the Palestinian groups. There is a civil war going on in Gaza. Scores of Palestinians have died in clashes between Fatah and Hamas.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Israel’s military actions and human rights violations are to be condemned. Each country must comply with international obligations and international law and should respect human dignity, something that can never be surrendered. We cannot demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal from the Palestinian territories, however, as long as the Palestinian authorities do not recognise the state of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Quartet, the United States of America, the United Nations, the EU and Russia, must obviously continue with their efforts to achieve a lasting peace. Parliament’s job is to demonstrate European consistency and support the Commission and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council which will take place in Geneva on 11-19 June 2007.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-108" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset the European Union welcomed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006 but has always emphasised that it expects the Council to be an efficient and credible body making a genuine contribution to the global protection and promotion of human rights. At the previous sessions of the Human Rights Council, the European Union has also attached importance to substantive debates on human-rights issues as well as to dialogue and close cooperation. During the fourth regular session, the European Union and the African Group succeeded in securing the adoption by consensus of their resolution on Darfur. This was the result of sustained efforts on the part of the European Union, and the outcome reflects not only the mandate of the Council but also the level of responsibility it should be expected to exercise.</p>
      <p sl="de">The capacity of the Human Rights Council to fulfil its mandate is inextricably linked to its composition. Allow me to recall once more that the General Assembly of the United Nations expects the member nations of the Council to observe the highest standards of human rights. It has also called on all UN Members to elect to the Council only those nations with good human-rights records. Although this ideal is still far from having been achieved, I should like to express the satisfaction of the European Union that the election of Belarus to the Human Rights Council was successfully thwarted in May. This success was due in no small part to the opposition of the European Union to the candidature of Belarus. Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player.</p>
      <p sl="de">In spite of some encouraging developments, such as the adoption of an International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, more action is needed to equip the Human Rights Council with the working practices and instruments it needs to live up to the expectations of the international community and particularly those of the European Union. The European Union attaches top priority to the institutional establishment of the Council. It is therefore making strenuous efforts to ensure that this institution-building process is successfully completed by the end of the first year. The forthcoming fifth session will therefore be crucially important. At that session the Council will take its concluding decisions on the establishment of the institution and will thereby ultimately determine its own efficiency and credibility for the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is currently cooperating closely in Geneva with all participants in order to achieve an outcome that will enable the Human Rights Council to make full use of its mandate. In the Presidency’s contacts with the President and the other delegations of the Human Rights Council, we are trying to establish a central role within the United Nations system for an efficient and credible Council. To this end the European Union wishes to insist on the creation of an effective and universal periodic review process and on the preservation of issue-based and country-based mandates. The planned code of conduct for special rapporteurs must not impair their independence; on the contrary, it must guarantee that independence and focus on the obligations of the states with which the rapporteurs cooperate. Moreover, we are pursuing the aim of establishing a suitable process for the selection of national representatives which will ensure that they possess the requisite expertise as well as guaranteeing their independence.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are aware of the difficulties involved in the pursuit of these objectives. Let me assure you that we will not relax our efforts to achieve them. It also remains the firm hope of the European Union that the Human Rights Council, with its sessions held at regular intervals throughout the year, its new and improved set of instruments and its continuing commitment to the present dialogue with special rapporteurs and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, will develop into a cornerstone of the human-rights system of the United Nations. It is now up to all members of the Human Rights Council to act responsibly and to work towards the achievement of these goals.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-109" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Benita Ferrero-Waldner" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office Günter Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, since it was founded, the European Union, as you know, has been one of the main driving forces for the protection of human rights and has therefore played an active role in pursuing the aims of the Human Rights Council and ensuring that the new body represents a real improvement on the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The initial aims have therefore been to ensure that the Council sessions deal with urgent human-rights issues in the context of actual occurrences, to improve coordination within the EU and to step up the Union’s outreach efforts, in other words its attempts to sensitise non-EU governments to human-rights issues. In these respects real progress has been made, allowing us, on the one hand, to make a coherent and credible stand in the Human Rights Council and, on the other hand, to enhance our cooperation with partners in other parts of the world through bilateral meetings as well as in multilateral forums and through a broad-based campaign to raise awareness in many of the world’s capitals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Among the priority tasks in the course of the first year have therefore been the safeguarding of the mandates and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council in the framework of the review process and the establishment of the new system, known as the universal periodic review, for the monitoring of the human-rights situation in all countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The general compromise package presented only yesterday by the President of the Human Rights Council certainly points in the right direction; while it needs improvement, from our perspective it is nevertheless a very good initial basis for negotiation. Next week’s fifth session of the Human Rights Council therefore assumes very special importance as a key to the future of that body. This is another reason why I am particularly pleased that a delegation from the European Parliament will be attending the session as part of the delegation from the European Communities.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the verdict on the performance of the Human Rights Council to date? It is impossible to provide a clear-cut answer, but in my view the Council should be an ongoing project, a kind of work in progress, as it were. Let me make a few brief comments. The first Council sessions were certainly rather disappointing. The old behaviour patterns resurfaced. We were already familiar with them, of course, from the Commission on Human Rights. The sessions on the Middle East in particular were truly marred by an uncooperative attitude on the part of the very states that had convened them. The result was unbalanced draft resolutions which we in the European Union were unable to support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me therefore make it clear that, while confrontation on human-rights issues may well be necessary on occasion when people’s fundamental rights are at stake, it is a different matter when human rights are used as a cover for the pursuit of a primarily political conflict. Just like the Council Presidency, however, we too have observed that the very good resolution on Darfur which was recently adopted there has mitigated these unfavourable impressions. I firmly believe that it is the most important resolution the Council has adopted. It was closely coordinated with the African Group in very protracted negotiations and was ultimately adopted by consensus. That was a considerable achievement when we consider what a sensitive issue it addressed, coupled with the fact that the EU can now be easily outvoted in the Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">The monitoring body of five independent UN rapporteurs that was established by the resolution will present its first report to the Council in the next few weeks, most probably next week.</p>
      <p sl="de">And let us not forget that the International Criminal Court recently indicted two Sudanese suspects. In short, there is at least movement on that front in Darfur. We very much hope that this will set an example as well as setting standards for the future work of the Human Rights Council. Lastly, the interactive dialogues with the High Commissioner and the UN’s special rapporteur have proved to be a very useful development. They have enabled us to approach the human-rights situation in individual countries – often in connection with more general human-rights issues – in a highly visible as well as far less confrontational manner. Our next step, however, is to find more ways of ensuring that these dialogues can be followed by practical progress on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">However impatient we may be for rapid progress in the UN Human Rights Council, I would warn anyone against snap judgments on the Council at this stage. All we can say so far is that there have been bright and dark sides. We are convinced that the EU will continue its efforts to build on the encouraging developments that have undoubtedly taken place and to nurture, in the framework of an intensive dialogue with its UN partners, an effective UN Human Rights Council and above all one that acts in the interests of the people concerned. It remains the main international forum for the treatment of human rights, and we in the EU have a responsibility to make active use of it to reinforce our values, our ideals and our interests.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all I would like to thank Council and Commission representatives for their reports about the first working year of the United Nations Human Rights Council and for the fifth United Nations Human Rights Council session. Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on a resolution concerning this issue, which sets out all the basic problems, such as our aspirations for the Human Rights Council's modus operandi, its mechanisms, special procedures, special rapporteurs, universal periodic review, and the role of the European Union. The European Parliament has undoubtedly expected and still expects a lot from the Human Rights Council for the simple reason that human rights are a matter of particular importance, since respect for human rights and their defence are a fundamental part of EU ethics and statutes, and in general they are the foundation of Europe's unity and integrity. The United Nations Human Rights Council can provide excellent possibilities for effective action in defending and safeguarding human rights, and for promoting them on behalf of the United Nations. In this regard the fifth session is particularly important, since one year of activity of the Human Rights Council has revealed problems and shortcomings, which can and must be fixed straight away. This is necessary so that the Human Rights Council can become a truly reliable structure – able to react adequately and, when required, quickly to breaches of human rights in any country of the world, and capable of finding effective means to influence the governments of those countries where human rights are being crudely violated. The first year of activity of the Human Rights Council has permitted us to ascertain whether, in applying its planned procedures and mechanisms, the Human Rights Council will be able to implement the ambitious programme that it has adopted for itself. The first year's experience, resolutions on Darfur, Iran and Uzbekistan, the application of confidentiality requirements when human rights abuses in the latter two countries were being discussed, as well as other decisions, have demonstrated that the procedures of the Human Rights Council must be maximally transparent, and that the special rapporteurs and experts need to be truly independent. Furthermore, it is essential to apply clear criteria when choosing members for the Human Rights Council: simple logic indicates that countries, in which there are gross violations of human rights, should not be chosen as members of the Human Rights Council.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that we can be pleased with the consensus that has been achieved amongst the groups in the House in relation to the text that we are going to put to the vote tomorrow for the fifth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">Since this Council was created, it has not had a very easy time. It is therefore important that the European Parliament should once again show consistency in terms of how to proceed with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and, specifically, how to facilitate and improve the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">On assessing its activities, it appears that there are certain deficiencies that need to be resolved and which are based on two fundamental problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the one hand, the weakness and insufficiency of the responses to dramatic and urgent situations that require much more vigorous action. I am referring primarily to the dramatic situation in Darfur, something to which everybody should be paying the greatest possible attention.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, the need substantially to improve the Council’s internal mechanisms and to improve the dynamics of the relationship between the member countries for the sake of more effective and ambitious work.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a fundamental problem underlying both issues, and Parliament and the European Union can do significant work in this regard. I am referring to political differences, which must not hinder the crucial common efforts to substantially reduce the vulnerability of the world’s peoples to abuses and violations of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">This aspect is vital, since Europe must be at the forefront in terms of treating all countries equally when it comes to dialogue on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that this philosophy must be extended to the Council and that the next Romanian Presidency of the United Nations Human Rights Council can offer a good opportunity for these essential improvements to become reality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, respect for human rights is of universal value and importance and is of course a fundamental principle of the EU. This House, not surprisingly, pays particular attention to this principle, as shown by the regular production of reports and resolutions dealing with human rights violations around the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was with great sadness that for years we watched the rather ineffective work of the Human Rights Commission, and it was with much relief that we welcomed, approximately a year ago, the replacement of the Human Rights Commission by the Human Rights Council. In the words of a Human Rights Watch representative, the Human Rights Commission in effect became the abusers’ club, because abusive governments were eager to be part of it in order to block action on themselves and on countries elsewhere. Unfortunately, our hopes for changes for the better were somewhat shaken after the Council elections, when Angola, Egypt and Qatar gained seats. Those three countries have a well-known, atrocious record of human rights abuses. The non-election of Belarus to the Council was a relief, although this occurred only by a tiny margin.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the Human Rights Council’s first year, we have seen some changes which have improved its function, but it has to be said that these changes were not spectacular. We expect and hope that more promising improvements are on the way. The Geneva-based Council has so far shown eagerness to deal with worldwide problems promptly and repeatedly if necessary, but the effectiveness of its work has to be looked at more critically. An example is the fact that last year the Council adopted no less than eight resolutions criticising Israel for its military actions in the Palestinian territories in Lebanon. These resolutions had some, but not much, usefulness in practical terms. This is not the fault of the UN Human Rights Council, but that Council has to assume some responsibility for not finding ways to make its voice heard more seriously. Other examples include the Council’s problematic dealings with Uzbekistan and Iran.</p>

At the World Conference on Climate Change last November, for example, the Union's delegation sat in Finland's place, as Finland held the Presidency at the time. We need to be able to occupy our rightful place as the EU to ensure our voice is heard clearly as we deal with the many problems in our contemporary world.

      <p sl="es">The Human Rights Council was created as a replacement for the Human Rights Commission and was faced with the by no means easy challenge of not falling into excessive politicisation and governmental interference in such an important area as overseeing universal respect for human rights. Nevertheless, the progress made so far, at least in this field, is worrying to say the least.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just yesterday we heard Jody Williams — the Human Rights Council’s special rapporteur for Darfur — complaining about the immense pressure upon her to make her report acceptable to everybody.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all know what that means. It means removing, or at least toning down, the criticisms as far as possible in order not to upset anybody.</p>
      <p sl="es">The most serious thing, however, is that these requests were made in order not to jeopardise the continuity of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">Things are going badly if a structure such as the Human Rights Council puts its own survival before what should be its primary and main responsibility: to ensure the protection of human rights in the world, which involves, amongst other things, identifying the people responsible for violations, even if they are governments, or particularly if they are governments.</p>
      <p sl="es">During this first anniversary of the Council’s existence we must bear these risks very much in mind if we do not want this Council to become just one more structure whose only purpose is to hide the shame of those who constantly violate the most fundamental human rights inside and outside of their borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">By means of this resolution, on which there is consensus in the European Parliament and I am pleased about that, we call upon, and encourage, the Council to take on a strong leadership role at the fifth session of the Human Rights Council, and we know that that will not be easy. But there are at least two issues that we would like it to prioritise.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the guarantee that special rapporteurs are selected on the basis of their independence and abilities and that they are able to continue operating as independent rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, that the periodic universal reviews also include the participation of independent experts.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the results of the work of the UN Human Rights Council in its first year are under scrutiny. The expectations of the international community have not yet been met. The most regrettable example is probably the resolution on the situation in Darfur, whose content was watered down partly as a result of the continuing compromises. The work has, understandably, been hampered by the fact that the operation and practices are still being developed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Our proposals for a resolution highlights, as it ought, the problem areas in the work of the Human Rights Council. Two matters in particular need to be paid attention to. Firstly, we have to learn from history. The work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), as the representative of the Human Rights Council, lost credibility, as sitting on the Council were countries which have glaringly violated human rights. The EU must continue doggedly to push through the condition that membership of the Human Rights Council is based on an objective criterion and that requirements for membership are sufficiently strict. The concept of human rights covers a very wide area. Certain fundamental human rights must be unconditionally incorporated in the conditions of membership. I think that the countries where Sharia courts are part of the judicial system are especially problematic. The EU must fight to ensure that this Human Rights Council does not become a club for abusers of human rights, in the way of the body which precedes it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other matter relates to the relationship between the Universal Periodic Review mechanism and the special procedures employed in individual countries. The EU needs to insist strongly that the work of the special experts in individual countries in the UN will in future be kept separate from the UPR and genuinely independent of governments. I regard it as worrying that Member States could use the indirect right of veto in the UPR in connection with a debate on the situation in a country, so that they fail to produce their country-specific report.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I understand the limitations the Human Rights Council assembly puts on the EU’s powers of influence. Just the countries of Africa and Asia together can, with their 29 seats, steer the Council’s work in a direction which differs from the aims of Western countries in the area of human rights. The EU must now demonstrate real leadership and a strong will. We should try and use the talks to break any regional blocs. I wish to thank the German Presidency, which has shown exemplary firmness in its call for prohibiting the death penalty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is now more than a year since the European Parliament cautiously welcomed the creation of the UN Human Rights Council to replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights. We hoped that the new Council would become an institution that would help reform the UN and that it would make a determined effort to ensure greater respect for human rights the world over.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union, the Member States and European Parliament delegations have all been actively involved in the work of the Council. It is now time to assess the first year of the Council’s operations. Unfortunately, it has to be recognised that so far the creation of this new Council has not marked a turning point in the UN’s activities in the area of human rights. The interests of various countries still take precedence over the defence of threatened fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This can best be illustrated by the Human Rights Council’s inability to respond appropriately to the situation in Darfur. A report on the tragic situation in that region was adopted in March, yet the Council as a whole was unable to draw logical conclusions from that report and deal with the problem of the Sudanese authorities' political responsibility for the political situation in that country. It is also the case that the Council has condemned Israel eight times. This demonstrates the imbalance in the Council’s work and its political bias.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fifth session of the Council is due to commence in a few days’ time. A European Parliament delegation will be present. The Netherlands, Slovenia and Italy have now joined the Council. Another European country to become a member is Bosnia-Hercegovina. Belarus, currently governed by Mr Lukaszenko’s authoritarian regime, has not been elected to the Council in order to avoid controversy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should ensure that Member States of the European Union become more involved in the work of the Council so that the latter is transformed into a body truly devoted to achieving respect for fundamental freedoms. At stake are an effective human rights policy in the contemporary world and UN reform. So too is the credibility of the European Union itself, and we would do well to remember that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has always followed the United Nations reform process constructively as an advocate of effective multilateralism. We want a strong UN, we want security and stability, we want an incisive war on poverty, and we want effective protection of human rights. As chair of the working party of the European Parliament on relations with the UN, I also have a very personal interest in the achievement of these aims.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the Human Rights Council was established as a new UN instrument, we warmly welcomed its creation, because it came with a set of very enticing promises: genuine election of members, rational working methods and the universal periodic review of all members. And today? Our resolution is highly critical: Angola, Qatar and Egypt have come on board to join nations like China and Cuba, and elections with a choice of candidates are virtually non-existent. We only just managed to prevent the election of Belarus. Members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries are in the majority in both the Asian and the African regional groups. This means that they control and effectively block the activities of the entire Council, from country reports to the universal review. I am on tenterhooks, Commissioner, regarding the fate of the package that was presented yesterday. I hope we have grounds for optimism.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of your remarks was particularly significant. You said that the European Union can easily be outvoted. This raises the question whether the West has done its homework. This is a question for the Council or, even better, the Member States. They were short-changed at the negotiations and did not even notice. This was clearly down to a lack of work on the part of our governments. But we parliamentarians must also ask ourselves whether our scrutiny, and that of our national counterparts, was strict enough. I believe it was not. This further reinforces the point that we parliamentarians must not leave the United Nations to our governments. We must strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the UN.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I am delighted by your critical appraisal of the first year of the Human Rights Council, because that body did not fulfil the hopes which were placed in it. But the fact is that the institution exists and is still the main international forum. We must work on that basis, and I hope we shall succeed in backing the Council out of the present dead end. Lastly, I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.</p>

I urge us not to drive a wedge now between parliaments and governments. That is not helpful – quite the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Even though there is room for improvement in this or that area, the European Union – and the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the governments and the Commission are all part of the Union – must stand together and send a clear signal that we are too firmly committed to human rights to let anyone sow division among us. I can only hope that progress can be made in one area or another during the second year, even though a sobering interim assessment is in order after one year. But I am spreading the word that we shall succeed together with you, who so fervently champion the cause of human rights.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the Human Rights Council as a body in its infancy that is still experiencing certain growing pains. It is not easy for the European Union to achieve any real progress in asserting our human-rights standards in the UN framework today. Why? Because we have few permanent allies. The support we receive usually comes from Canada, Switzerland, Norway, the countries applying for EU membership and individual countries covered by our neighbourhood policy, to name a few of the main sources. This list is not exhaustive, but we are often faced with a united front of G77 countries, and we can rarely achieve anything if a confrontational approach is adopted.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must draw our own conclusions from this. Where does the problem lie? What can we do? We could, for example, strengthen the Special Rapporteur, support the High Commissioner for Human Rights and introduce universal reviews, but we could also condemn the most serious cases and denounce the most flagrant violations. In other words, in specific instances we must continue to do some very plain talking on behalf of the victims of abuses.</p>
      <p sl="de">I often wish we could respond and react more quickly to developments. From the very beginning, for example, I have been calling for a kind of warning mechanism. I very much hope that we can move gradually in that direction. In the longer term, however, the achievement of the aims of the Human Rights Council will depend on the establishment of a new approach to human rights within the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="de">The transition to this new approach, indeed, was at the heart of the resolution on the creation of the new Council. The resolution states that the work of the Council ‘shall be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation’. We must also be aware, of course, that there will never be an apolitical UN forum. It therefore goes without saying that we must not only promote our values but also defend all of our interests.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, may I, on behalf of the Presidency, state very clearly that the latest reports on migrants who have lost their lives when their boats have foundered in the Mediterranean, the reports of tragedies that have occurred there, remind us of the responsibility that we as Member States have in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regardless of all the tenets of immigration policy, when there is a real and present danger to life and limb, the protection of human life, as the supreme value, must have absolute priority. This principle is not only enshrined in a number of international conventions; it also accords with our common understanding of the values on which the European Union is based.</p>
      <p sl="de">Irrespective of the question of legal jurisdiction, the European Union undoubtedly bears political responsibility, and we should shoulder that responsibility together. This is why the Presidency, by agreement with the Commission, has decided that the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers should debate this issue at their next meeting on 12 June.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there have been problems in the past in the interpretation and application of international conventions and that these problems still arise today. We as Member States must recognise the responsibility we have to prevent such human tragedies, and the Hague Programme rightly and explicitly emphasises the need for close cooperation among all states as well as for solidarity and shared responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">Besides the need to save human lives, the decisive message is that we must not let it come to the point at which unscrupulous criminal organisations put these people’s lives in danger by trying to transport them illegally to Europe. This is why it is important that, as part of a general strategy for the resolution of the migration issue, we also achieve better cooperation with the countries of origin and transit. It is essential to step up this cooperation in the framework of the political dialogue on migration issues with the governments of these countries, especially in the context of the Euromed partnership and the follow-up process to the EU-Africa migration conferences in Rabat and Tripoli.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that our efforts of the last few months and the debates at all Council meetings during the Finnish and German presidencies have been a first step towards ensuring that the European Union will be able to deal with these tragedies more effectively and convincingly in future for the sake of the people concerned.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Altmeier, has said a great deal and I agree with the position he has taken. I shall certainly emphasise one essentially political aspect of it, which is the requirement to tackle the immigration issue by combining the need to stop the traffic in human beings and any kind of illegal activity with the absolute need for solidarity, and solidarity means first and foremost saving human lives in danger.</p>
      <p sl="it">When we are faced with the risk of losing even a single human life, as has quite rightly been mentioned and as we emphasise in our joint statement, strictly legal questions concerning the implementation of international conventions on maritime law – which also needs to be done rigorously and thoroughly – take second place. Human lives in danger need to be saved first. Of course, solidarity is not just that.</p>
      <p sl="it">Solidarity lies at the basis of the global approach that the Commission is taking, in the wake of the unanimous support given by the European Council last December and in strict collaboration with the German Presidency of the European Union in this first half of the year. First and foremost, there must be solidarity among the EU Member States, which means that every State in the Union, even those that are convinced that they are less affected by the daily immigration tragedy, must understand that the problem is also theirs and concerns the whole EU, with no exceptions. It would seem to be an obvious decision, then, to provide patrols in the Atlantic Ocean to support Spain, which would otherwise have to face the enormous flow of migrants to the Canary Islands all alone, or a patrol in the Mediterranean to meet the demands of countries like Malta or Cyprus, the smallest Mediterranean members of the EU, not to mention the larger ones.</p>
      <p sl="it">All the Member States must play their part in the patrols, and I shall very amicably tell all the ministers next week that not enough has yet been done or is being done, after the commitment to make equipment available. That is the first aspect of solidarity among the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is a financial aspect to solidarity. The sums needed to introduce the patrols and to offer people in difficulty protection and a decent reception need to be shared. In that respect, ladies and gentlemen, I am forced to appeal to you as well, with my usual sincerity. This Parliament is still holding in reserve EUR 12.7 million that is vitally needed right now, not in a week’s time, if the Frontex missions are to continue. I respect this Parliament's decisions, but I must say quite frankly that if the reserve, which is due to be examined on about 24-25 June, is only released at the end of this month, we run the risk of having to stop the Frontex missions in the central Mediterranean and the Canaries owing to lack of funds. Immediate steps are needed to release the funds, which are available but have been put on one side.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is another matter that has to do with solidarity: our commitment to the other countries involved. We have promised to work more closely with the countries of origin and of transit. We have said very clearly that we want them to contribute effectively and that we are ready to help the countries of origin through a system of legal, regular and monitored immigration. We put forward a clear proposal on this subject two weeks ago.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time we are asking for support from the countries of origin and of transit to prevent human trafficking and to explain very clearly to all those who want to set off across the Atlantic or Mediterranean that they will be embarking on a journey not to riches but into serious danger. What is needed before anything else, therefore, is political cooperation, not police cooperation, so as to create the conditions for providing even clearer information on this issue in the countries of origin, information that is currently lacking. Conversely, Europe is ready to welcome people who want to work honestly and within the law. As we all know, such people are needed in many Member States where there is a shortage of labour. That is another aspect of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is an important form of solidarity in receiving immigrants, including illegal ones. It is my conviction that every Member State has a duty to do all it can to save human lives at sea, but it is also necessary for the other Member States to realise that we cannot leave Malta, for example, to bear the whole burden of receiving all the immigrants saved in the middle of the Mediterranean by Maltese vessels. The situation requires solidarity and also a politically based outline agreement to determine where we can receive the immigrants that arrive in the most exposed countries. This is another face of solidarity: offering to receive immigrants in a broader range of Member States, and not just in those that are in the front line. That is another point on which we have to find an agreement in principle, which sadly has not yet been found.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think we will have to address a further issue at the Council of Ministers next week: who is responsible for patrolling the search and rescue regions on the high seas that come under third-country responsibility? The case of Libya has been mentioned. According to international conventions, every country has a region of the open sea where it is responsible for search and rescue on the high seas. What happens if a non-EU country like Libya does not carry out its search and rescue duty at sea? What can we Europeans do to intervene in that region? Who should take responsibility? These are rules that need to be established and do not yet exist. The problem concerns the implementation of international conventions, not of European laws. The time has come, however, to address this subject within the EU, and I think it will be a good idea to start debating this as well at the Council of Ministers next week.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, where does the responsibility lie and what kind of solidarity is needed for the initial reception of immigrants when they first arrive and have to be received in conditions commensurate with human dignity, which are inalienable and non-negotiable? Who should take the responsibility and how should we share out the tasks among the Member States? Again, can we expect a small country in the middle of the Mediterranean to do it all alone? That would not be an example of solidarity among the Member States, so that is another aspect with which we should be concerned. The European Union can do a great deal in that respect: it can help to fund and organise repatriation operations in the countries of origin in compliance with the rules that guarantee the absolute dignity of everyone being repatriated. Of course, all immigrants, even illegal ones, have every right to respect for their human dignity, but we cannot impose our views if there are any Member States that refuse to play their part.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is the solidarity to which I am referring, and those are the guiding principles to ensure that the tragedy that occurred a few days ago – it is not a question of accusing or blaming anyone for it, but of learning a tragic lesson – can never happen again.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President the worst thing we could do would be to point the finger at one another instead of working together to find a solution to this serious problem, a problem that, as has been said, does not simply pertain to one country, but to all countries. To point a finger at Malta in connection with the incidents that occurred in Libyan waters and therefore not under Malta’s responsibility is wrong and unfair. Malta is well aware of its obligations and is honouring them while maintaining full respect for human life. So much so that the majority of immigrants who arrive in Malta every year and who are picked up from the sea are saved from death’s door. However, the burden Malta has to carry is already disproportionate. To cite an example, Mr Altmaier: the maritime area that Malta is responsible for monitoring is about two thirds the size of Germany or almost three quarters the size of Italy. We are responsible for the whole of that area. Until now Malta has patrolled this area single-handedly because Frontex has not even begun its rounds as yet. Commissioner, this Parliament is so eager to get Frontex’s operations started that it has doubled the Frontex budget. However, up till now Frontex has proved to be completely ineffective in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the fact that Malta has to shoulder the blame for incidents that take place in Libyan waters is unjust and unfair. Instead of accusing one another, we must work together to come up with a solution. Indeed, the solution, if we want it, is a clear one. Seeing as this is not the problem of solely one country, the burden constituted by the immigrants rescued from Maltese waters ought to be distributed between everyone: - yes, between the 27 Member States of the European Union. This is perfectly clear. What is not clear, Mr President, is whether national governments are willing to shoulder this responsibility and share out the burden. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is absolutely intolerable that, every summer, we witness human tragedies on the borders of Europe. In spite of our indignation, every year these tragedies are repeated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can the European Union leave these people alone faced with their despair at the gates of Europe? The Commission must ask for commitments from Member States at the next Justice and Home Affairs (JAI) Council: we must ensure that no events of this kind can ever happen again. It is intolerable that we should be debating the responsibilities of individuals while there were people in danger at sea and they were not rescued.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Malta bears a large part of the responsibility, that is sure. Giving assistance to people in distress is a duty and not a choice, but they were left to die. I believe, however, that we are all responsible for this tragedy. I received messages from many Maltese who are people who care and who are distressed at seeing immigrants treated in this fashion and their country in this situation. At the same time, however, they are aware that their little country has been abandoned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say here that these events demonstrate the lack of European solidarity in relation to the management of borders and the reception of emigrants. It is intolerable that the burden should rest essentially with the countries of the South and East of Europe. Europe must show its solidarity and take action so that costs and responsibilities are shared by all Member States. That is why I call on Member States to grant more resources to Frontex so that maritime missions can begin before the end of June and be broadly developed, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was satisfied to learn that the evaluation of the Dublin II regulation is to be presented to us in the days to come. That is what we have been told recently. We have been asking for it for several months, even though now it is no longer an evaluation that is needed but a swift revision. The Dublin II regulation is obviously not appropriate, especially for a small country like Malta.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we ask the Commission where the discussions with Libya have got to concerning immigration. Recent events have shown Libya’s inability to give help to migrants and people in distress. We have already said it and we repeat: the European Union must not shrug off its responsibilities and pass them on to a country that does not apply appropriate standards in relation to the protection of fundamental rights.</p>

Staggeringly, it appears that not everybody takes the moral and lawful duty equally seriously. Of course, as Mrs Roure pointed out a moment ago, Malta has a difficult job where the large influx of illegals is concerned. This is beyond dispute. We should therefore get this so wished for and much-discussed solidarity underway as quickly as possible. It also strikes me that the swift introduction of a burden sharing-mechanism is called for.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This reality, though, does not in any way justify the way in which Malta thinks it should handle its moral and lawful duty. After all, we are talking about an EU Member State, which means that we as a Union are responsible. While Malta and Libya cannot agree on the precise location of 27 people drowning, they hang on to fishing nets for three days. This is not an isolated incident, unfortunately. Absurd. We all know that Libya is not exactly renowned for being the paradise of human rights or humane opinions, far from it. The fact that the Union is at risk of adopting the same view on these drowning people is an outright scandal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yesterday in my discussion dossier for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I came across a study on illegal immigrants at sea, the actions proposed in which should be implemented as a matter of priority. Commissioner Frattini will need to join forces with Commissioner Barrot in this. Money alone is not enough. You know very well that it is precisely the Council that has the key where the conditions regarding the return of illegal immigrants are concerned. Let it at the same time and above all be clear that nobody, yes nobody, should hide behind so-called legal loopholes in international maritime law, for example. Where there is a political will, there is definitely a way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off with a comment to the Council. Presidents of the Council, you can include Berlin declarations, in which European values are central, until the cows come home. If nothing at all is done in practice, however, then reality gives us a totally different picture and you as President of the Council are putting the EU’s credibility in the balance. Translate the fine words you so like to proclaim, and which you did a moment ago, into action. I would urge you to fulfil the ambitions you enshrined in the Tampere and The Hague programmes, among others. Deliver on your promises. With all due respect, a debate next week is fantastic, but is really not good enough. The issues are not new. Action is what is called for right now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think many of the recent incidents and the shocking pictures that we have seen of a small boat towing people in its net, are the result – as we have been hearing – of a catalogue of failures, many of them absolutely avoidable with a bit of forward planning. We assume that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will be doing some of that. It would have been avoidable if Member States had delivered on their promises regarding logistical and other support for Frontex and other measures promised in the wake of the experience in the Canaries, Lampedusa, Malta, Cyprus, etc. It would have been avoidable, as Commissioner Frattini said, if Member States had prepared a plan B for when Libya fails to carry out its obligations. Indeed, it appears that Libya has not clearly defined its maritime rescue area, so why are we negotiating in an emergency when we know there is already disagreement and we could have planned ahead?</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Mrs Roure: we need to beware of the agreements we negotiate with a country which has such a poor record on human rights. That covers many of the transit and origin countries too. Such agreements have to be in the public domain, whether multilateral or bilateral, and this Parliament has yet to receive documents promised by the Italian authorities after our visit to Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group believes we need an asylum agency to organise expert teams to help countries under stress assess claims. With reference to Dublin II, we are also aware that the fear of consequences makes some states reluctant to act and assume responsibility because they feel they are on their own. But there is also an issue about the reception and procedures directives and the quality of their implementation. The EU must again provide support to ensure a quality procedure: another task for an asylum agency.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we also have to provide back-up in other countries to deal with the processing of arrivals. We also need to be clear that we do not penalise those who carry out rescues, so we have no more Cap Anamur-style prosecutions. We are told that the law of the sea is clear: people in distress should be rescued regardless of their status. I am absolutely certain that, had those people pictured in our media been cruise-line passengers, they would have been picked up far more quickly than was the case.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini was right to talk about solidarity, but for us the first solidarity that we should show is to the families of the people drowned in the Mediterranean, solidarity to explain to ourselves as well that we should stop calling them illegal immigrants but should probably refer to them as shipwrecked people. That is in fact what they are: people – men and women – who drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe and who were not even given a chance of being saved or rescued at sea, but were actually left for three days clinging to a tuna net. It has to be said quite plainly: someone has to take serious responsibility for that!</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Frattini said so clearly in an interview to an Italian newspaper, when he mentioned the serious responsibility of the Maltese Government. That needs to be repeated here in this Chamber, as well as the fact that they did not even have the decency to bury those people; even the idea of taking them in after death was rejected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore we ought seriously to consider the fact that, although Frontex may have a specific task to perform, its priority must be to rescue people at sea. That is something we said a short while ago when we were debating the Rapid Border Intervention Teams. This, sadly, was by no means the first tragedy; over the last ten years more than 9 000 human beings have drowned while trying to reach Europe, but this was the worst tragedy in the last ten years.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should also carefully consider the need to expand the legal channels for people to enter legally and also the possibility of reviewing the Dublin II regulation in order to prevent what has been happening.</p>
      <p sl="it">Look, in my view something serious is taking place: we are losing sight of the guiding principles of Western civilisation, which is based on hospitality and the right to burial. As the great tragic playwrights of ancient Greece taught us, we ought to start afresh from that point, not least so that we can develop a new idea of reception and hospitality for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, it is important to recall today the pictures we have all seen in the newspapers and on television. A boat would be spotted from the air, and by the time the local rescue operation was launched, the boat was no longer there, and 53 to 57 people had drowned. We are talking today about other cases too, in which almost everyone found on these boats was dead. We are talking about children, about babies, about many unknown people – in short, about an appalling tragedy which must surely horrify us. Allow me, therefore, to say first of all on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that this issue goes right to the heart of Europe. It is about fundamental rights, about the very foundation stone of our values, namely the right to life. Today’s debate is not about the immigration argument, about whom we let into Europe and whom we exclude, but about quintessentially humanitarian matters. I must therefore stress that values do not stop at borders; we Europeans believe that values are indivisible, and we must apply them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to emphasise that, as many of my honourable colleagues have said, there is now a pressing need for European solidarity. Leaving a tiny country like Malta and other countries along our southern rim to their own devices and then pointing an accusing finger at them is not the way to act. No, this is a European issue. I find it a great pity that this tragedy has had little media impact in central and northern Europe and that people in those parts have shown no interest in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Action is needed now. For that reason, Commissioner, I gladly embrace, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, the idea that we should discuss a spending freeze if funds are needed for this purpose. I ask the Council through you, Peter, not only to adopt decisions but to take long-overdue action now. Decisions will not save people’s lives; only practical measures can save lives. That is why I am calling quite specifically for this humanitarian disaster to be one of the main items on the agenda at next week’s meeting of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again had pictures shown in our homes of desperate situations and deaths of emigrants. These pictures once again show the most dramatic and visible face of illegal immigration. They once again illustrate a repeated humanitarian emergency that requires an immediate and vigorous response.</p>
      <p sl="es">This situation will not come to an end on its own. More than 9 000 people have already died trying to cross the Mediterranean and, with the arrival of the good weather, this figure will continue to grow.</p>
      <p sl="es">Last week, the authorities of a Member State failed to comply with their fundamental international obligations with regard to the rescue and reception of shipwrecked people. Well, it is not sufficient to condemn that State for its unacceptable attitude and ask it to take on its responsibilities in order to ensure that that situation does not arise again. Nor can we delegate the fight against illegal immigration to captains of fishing vessels. We are not talking about a Maltese problem. It is a European problem that requires a generalised response based on solidarity amongst all of us. I shall insist: all of the Member States, shared responsibility, transparency and mutual trust.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Council, the Commission and this House immediately to adopt specific measures to put an end to this unacceptable situation. Frontex must cease to be a mirage and it must be provided with the resources necessary for joint monitoring patrols to operate permanently throughout the year in the high-risk areas.</p>

      <p sl="es">It is absolutely intolerable that we should leave a group of human beings to die while the governments and bureaucracies of various Members States argue about who is obliged to rescue these shipwrecked people who are dying from starvation, from drowning, from exposure to the sun …</p>
      <p sl="es">Malta has its obligations and its attitude has been intolerable and deserves to be condemned. The Union, however, must of course be in a position to support Malta today, Spain, in the Canary Islands, yesterday, and wherever else tomorrow, when it comes to saving the lives of people who wish to enter the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The summer is beginning and, with it, we are once again seeing the human flow of people who wish to live out their dreams in London or Hamburg, but who are destined to die on the beaches of the south.</p>

      <p sl="es">We are currently in the midst of a debate on the future of Europe, on what we want and what we can do together. Well, it is in fields such as this that the European Union can find its legitimacy. I am not just talking about credibility. I am talking about legitimacy. The European Union can also lose its legitimacy in this area, however.</p>
      <p sl="es">What kind of Union do we have amongst us that can organise and regulate all sorts of things — some of which many of our citizens consider to be absurd, and even idiotic — but which is incapable of organising things in such a way that people who are trying to reach our borders do not die, that people trying to reach our castles are not doomed to die at the castle gates?</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Vice-President, you have an historic challenge, a political and historic challenge. You have the responsibility to promote solidarity, but if solidarity does not emerge, you have the responsibility to impose it. You have the power to do so. If solidarity does not emerge, you will have to impose it. Impose it politically, shaming those States that do not take on their responsibilities, and impose it by force by means of legislative proposals so that everybody assumes their responsibility towards the present and the past, with so many deaths attributable to governments that do not play their part.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, every day more would-be illegal immigrants try to reach the European continent, and every day we experience intolerable situations and intolerable tragedies in southern Europe. The European Union has created Frontex. The European Parliament was prepared to double the annual budget for border surveillance. Frontex now has a budget of 35 million euros. Nevertheless, more illegal immigrants are entering the European Union daily. The plain and simple fact is that border surveillance is not working. The assistance to Member States and the coordination that Frontex is supposed to provide are not working.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the coordination is defective, the work of Frontex invites criticism. If, however, the Member States do not deliver the manpower and equipment they promised to provide, it is they who must be held to account and made to honour their obligations. In no circumstances should we put the entire onus on the countries of southern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context I have a question to put to our Commissioner. In a press release on 24 May, the Commission reported that the number of aircraft, ships and other items of equipment made available to date had been satisfactory. Today, in another report from the Commission, we learn that it is criticising the Member States, which have delivered only a tenth of the promised aircraft, ships and helicopters. So which version is correct? Can you please put the record straight, Commissioner? If the Frontex agency has been set up by us and is so well funded, it must perform. If that is not the case, let us please abolish it and explore other avenues.</p>
      <p sl="de">One way or the other – and I appeal here to everyone in a position of responsibility – the European Union, as well as monitoring our own borders, must provide assistance for the establishment of a functioning system of border surveillance in the transit countries – that is a form of local assistance which will help us in turn – as well as granting stabilisation aid and conducting local information campaigns in the countries of origin. It is certainly high time we took action instead of continuing to discuss an intolerable situation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse what Mr Frattini has said here today and in the interviews he has given in recent days, but someone who does not endorse them at all is the Maltese Minister for Foreign Affairs. In a statement this afternoon he explained that Malta cannot take charge of illegal immigrants who legally do not come under its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="it">Twenty-one people who drowned are not a legal matter, and somebody at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers, either the Presidency or the Commission, needs to explain to the Maltese Government the difference between illegal immigrants and shipwreck victims. Somebody needs to remind the Maltese Foreign Minister that a fishing boat flying the Maltese flag decided to leave 27 people clinging to a tuna fishing line because they thought it was more important to save the tuna they had caught than human lives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Somebody needs to explain to the Maltese Minister and all the rest of our ministers that humanitarian law has nothing to do with legal obligations or the conventions signed by our countries. Since I believe that it is important to put words into deeds, I agree with you, Mr Frattini, that the Frontex funds need to be released and that all countries need to take this requirement on board but, at the same time, allowing Frontex or the European repatriation fund to receive these funds must be made conditional on fulfilling their duty to assist anyone in distress at sea, in whatever circumstances and no matter what the legal status of the shipwreck.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, it is a disgrace that, once again, so many people had to lose their lives before the European Union’s lack of concrete action on immigration was exposed. Although I believe that all the Member States must shoulder their burden of responsibility, especially when it comes to life or death situations, the Commission and, especially, the Council must also share part of the responsibility. In my opinion, the Commission and the Council are not treating the situation with the urgency it deserves or giving it the commitment it merits. Looking back at what has been done during these past four years, it is easy to see that, if you eliminate the meaningless buzzwords of ‘solidarity’ and ‘mobilisation’, few measures have actually been taken to address this alarming situation. We expect immediate action to be taken on the burden-sharing principle, on the revision of Dublin 2 and on logistical and administrative assistance in order to effectively coordinate the joint patrols, which up till now have been practically ghost-like and which were promised to us long ago by Frontex. Until now, it seems that Frontex has simply been an agency that has been too stunned to take action, due to the enormity of the crisis facing it. Yet, no country can go on trying to cope with this tragedy alone, especially one as small as Malta and one that is already carrying a far greater load than it can bear. At this stage the priority should be the actual crisis and not identifying those who are to blame. We have to carry out an emergency Marshall-type plan before we find ourselves obliged to repeat the same speeches again when another tragedy takes place. We have no time to lose; too many lives have been lost. I hope that the definition of solidarity given by Commissioner Frattini will in fact be implemented. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who have said that we need action rather than mere words. And the Council has indeed been taking action in recent months. The Council ensured that the centralised record of available technical equipment, the Frontex toolbox, was stocked up and that Frontex, at least in principle, has more than 100 ships, aircraft and helicopters at its disposal. With the support of this Parliament, the Council ensured that the Regulation on the RABITs, the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, could be adopted. There will be a Frontex operation in the waters around Malta, where we shall try, with the assistance of experts from the Member States and the support of helicopters from the Member States, to put an end to this human tragedy. I must say, however, that it would have been better if we had been able to launch these operations a few weeks earlier. That is a responsibility we must all accept collectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past few months we also agreed, in response to a proposal from the Commission, to implement regional protection programmes in countries of origin and transit. We took positive action by agreeing on the conclusion of partnership agreements and by discussing incentives for legal immigration and circular migration. We are engaged in negotiations on the subject of readmission agreements with countries in Africa and elsewhere. All of these things are taking us in the right direction. It is nevertheless true that many of these measures have come too late and that it would have been better for the people concerned if more rapid and efficient action had been taken.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, I think this is also attributable to the lack of efficiency in the Council’s decision-making procedure. It is unfortunate that the European Constitution has not yet entered into force, because the European Constitution and the reforms it provides for would enable us to take the necessary decisions much more swiftly and much more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the coming days and weeks we shall have to ensure that we live up to our humanitarian responsibility for the people in distress. We shall also have to ensure that we do not leave Malta in the lurch. Malta is a small country with a great responsibility in the area in question. For this reason Malta is entitled to the solidarity of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, we shall have to ensure that none of the action we take creates new pull factors that lead to more and more people trying to make their way to Europe, because we shall otherwise run the risk of multiplying rather than alleviating the human misery. This is why I firmly believe that the Council will summon up the strength to send out a clear signal at its meeting next week.</p>

    <intervention id="3-140" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse what Mr Altmaier has said. Next week the Council of Ministers will certainly address this issue candidly in a truly political debate. I shall not, therefore, repeat the references to the many positive measures that have already been taken. All of you will remember that just two years ago there was not a single document on joint European action on immigration; today we are talking about how to apply the documents and principles that have emerged from a political consensus that used not to exist but now does. Steps forward have been made, but not everything has been done as quickly as it should have been.</p>
      <p sl="it">As somebody mentioned, we have had a major increase in funding for Frontex: EUR 35 million for 2007. However, EUR 13 million of that has been withheld and therefore cannot be used, and the corresponding spending cannot be undertaken. I am grateful for what has been said about Parliament’s commitment to getting this sum released to Frontex straight away. The toolbox made available to Frontex has been sufficient. I said the same thing a few weeks ago, after reading the commitment statements by the Ministers for Internal Affairs of at least 19 European countries. What I said then, at the end of May, was that for this summer we have over 100 boats, over 100 patrol vessels, 25 helicopters and 20 aeroplanes. What I have said today, however, is also true: since the formal commitment was adopted until now, we have only received one tenth of the equipment promised.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall tell the Ministers and their colleagues in the Council quite amicably that what they committed themselves to providing needs to be made available straight away. Had we had not five but 50 patrol vessels, perhaps a vessel might have arrived sooner to save those people from drowning. An Italian vessel could have intervened, and then a French one to recover the bodies of the victims and take them to France. Perhaps if we had had a greater presence we could have dealt with it sooner. That, you have to admit, would be solidarity in practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also have to remember that in the areas where Frontex has operated – I mean in the Canary Islands last year, for example – it has had a positive effect overall. I cannot forget that the Spanish Minister for Internal Affairs stated at the end of autumn last year that migration to the Canaries had fallen by about 30%, thanks to Frontex patrols in collaboration with a third country, in this case Senegal. When the operations work, the results are obvious.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the central Mediterranean, Libya had a visit from us a few days ago. A Frontex mission went to Libya to explore the possibility of providing aid to Libya to control its southern desert border with Niger. We told Libya quite clearly that we expect it to carry out more controls and above all to observe its territorial search and rescue region on the high seas, which Libya is bound to observe, like any other country.</p>
      <p sl="it">The mission will be called Nautilus II and will be sent to the central Mediterranean; it will depart as planned within a few days, and of course I hope as many Member States as possible will take part in it, not just the Mediterranean countries. The German Government has indicated that it will take part in the central Mediterranean mission, even though it is not a Mediterranean State, and then there will be some Mediterranean States too. I would like to see my country, Italy, take part for example, although so far it has not given any indication that it wants to take part in this mission, which is going to operate precisely in the area between Sicily, Malta and Libya. This is a concrete example of the appeal for solidarity that I shall, of course, make to the Ministers, but I am also appealing to you.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final topic is the Dublin regulation, which was mentioned by Mrs Roure, among others. The report was published today and has been adopted by the Commission. It shows how well the Dublin regulation mechanism has worked. The regulation has worked properly, but the Commission suggests certain additions. It suggests considering whether the principle whereby only the country of initial destination is required to receive immigrants can be the only fair solution or whether a better way of sharing the burden could be incorporated. That is also the subject of a proposal adopted today by the Commission, a Green Paper on asylum policy from now to 2010, as this Parliament requested. The proposals are there, and I am still expecting a gesture of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Clearly, if a large majority of the Member States says that the system is working well as it is, that means that the country of first destination will still have to bear the whole burden, and that is not solidarity. That is another example of how even the Dublin regulation needs to be interpreted correctly, not to point the finger at anyone, but to ensure that everyone works together.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In September 2006, Parliament launched an appeal to Member States and to the Commission in a resolution adopted by all the political groups. We were insisting on the need for strengthening partnerships and dialogues with the countries of origin.

It is of the utmost urgency to establish a fair mechanism for solidarity and for sharing responsibilities between all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, we have to recognise the lack of results from Frontex. Genuine political willingness is fundamental if Member States are to give adequate resources to this agency to enable it to function effectively in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">In this way we laid the foundations for a modern information exchange for police forces in Europe while applying high standards of data protection. This Convention that was concluded by some of the Member States is now to become an EU-wide instrument. It is to be incorporated into the legislative framework of the European Union, and its core provisions will apply in all 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are thereby contributing to the security of the people of Europe, because DNA-matching among a small number of countries has already resulted in the identification of criminals and in convictions for serious crimes. We are also helping to enhance the capacity of the European Union to act, for it is only right that this Convention should no longer be treated as an instrument of international law but as part of our common European legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to thank all Member States, as well as the European Commission and the Members of the European Parliament, for having helped to clear the way for the replacement of the Convention in spite of a very tight time frame. In converting the Convention into a Council Decision and in implementing that Decision, we shall also take due account of the opinions of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">We shall decide next week on the visa-information system on which we reached political agreement with the European Parliament back in May. Now that an agreement has been reached in Coreper, there is a good chance that the Council will confirm the decision on access next week. A formal agreement will then be concluded once the wording has been checked by the lawyer-linguists.</p>
      <p sl="de">The visa-information system is a particularly important means of consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice. It will mean that alphanumerical and biometric data can be stored and retrieved during visa procedures. This will help to ensure that we are able to combat multiple visa applications, identity frauds and other forms of deception more effectively than hitherto.</p>
      <p sl="de">The decision on access to the VIS will also enable security authorities to search the VIS for the purpose of preventing, discovering and investigating terrorist crimes and other serious offences. These new research facilities for the security authorities will be a vital step forward in efforts to protect the public, especially from terrorism and organised crime. Let me stress that the agreement we reached with the European Parliament is a very balanced and sound agreement which reconciles the diverse arguments that have been advanced.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we manage to improve police cooperation in Europe as these two measures are designed to do, thereby creating more security for our citizens, we must also ensure that data protection is given a high profile in the European Union and that the abuse of data transmitted between Member States is prevented and effectively combated.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason I am delighted that major progress has been achieved in recent weeks on the assignment of the framework decision on data protection to the third pillar, that we were able, with the agreement of the rapporteur of the European Parliament, to deal with a new draft in two readings within the Council working group and that we have sharply reduced the number of the reservations which have been a barrier to rapid progress in the past. This new revised draft guarantees a high level of protection. The protection level prescribed by Council of Europe Convention No 108 of 1981 and by the additional protocol of 2001 will be fully guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the issues of the scope of the decision and the rules relating to non-EU countries, we shall also find sound solutions. The European Parliament has made a very important contribution in this respect, and I should like to thank you most sincerely again on behalf of the Presidency for your extraordinarily rapid treatment of the revised draft. Particularly with regard to the adequacy of the protection afforded by states outside the Union and the inclusion of a provision on the forwarding of data to non-public bodies, we are on the way to finding effective solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that the evaluation clause proposed by the European Parliament with regard to the scope of the decision is a thoroughly constructive solution, and we shall use the remaining term of the German presidency to achieve further progress. With his fifteen principles for data protection, Commissioner Frattini helped to ensure that we were able to frame the key provisions in this area. At the Council meeting we shall propose a Council statement and press for due adherence to these principles in subsequent deliberations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-146" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have much to add after the considerations put forward by Mr Altmaier on behalf of the Council. Concerning the first of the topics being debated, we have from the outset supported the German Presidency’s initiative to transfer most of the third-pillar provisions of the Prüm Treaty into European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">That will facilitate and strengthen cross-border cooperation among police authorities and will certainly facilitate one factor that is absolutely essential if we want to enhance security in the European area, and that is the exchange of information needed to prevent and suppress crime. This exercise is of course also based on the fact that the provisions of the treaty have been shown to be useful where they have already been applied. We have had the opportunity to read an interesting report supplied by the Presidency on how application of the Prüm Treaty between Germany and Austria has produced some positive and surprising results. It has led to the detection of serious criminal acts precisely because certain provisions of this treaty have been used.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is an important aspect to this: the application of the principle of availability – that is, the exchange of information, which promotes a flow of information – has to be accompanied by adequate protection of personal data. In the event of improper use, there need to be clear rules on prevention that can stop all that happening once and for all. In my view, it is vital that the Council’s decision, already given by the Presidency, is confirmed, and I strongly hope it will be. I am confident that it can be adopted in Luxembourg next week. It contains a clear reference to personal data protection, because unfortunately we do not yet have a framework decision on data protection in this area. This Council decision transferring the articles of the Prüm Treaty into the European acquis therefore clearly has to deal with data protection, as a precondition for making the exchange of information compatible.</p>
      <p sl="it">A final aspect of the decision concerns periodical assessment. This will be an important assessment of both operational effectiveness – in other words, how this series of measures will work – and the operation of the safeguard clauses. The assessment will also be useful for Parliament, which will of course receive a copy of it.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the Visa Information System, I have to congratulate the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, and the Presidency, and also commend them on their joint efforts to reach a good agreement. A good agreement may in any case be useful to ensure that both the security requirements demanded by many governments and the demands for personal data protection are met. These are non-negotiable rights for the European Union. In our consulates and at our border posts we will have better instruments that will work more effectively and will be made available to honest travellers, while they will also enable the police to detect serious infringements of the law. Data protection rules have been firmly incorporated into the VIS. These rules, including those on fingerprints, were absolutely crucial. Thanks to this agreement the Commission can now develop the technical application that will be needed, because, as you know, our aim is to have the VIS up and running by the spring of 2009 as planned.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a specific requirement regarding the operational management of the system, which is that the operational management should be entrusted to a technical body, after an impact assessment has been carried out. This technical body may be proposed operationally within the first two years of operation of the VIS, either because of the economic implications that are yet to be assessed or because of the technical impact assessment that is to be performed. I can give you my personal assessment now: if there is going to be an operational management body, it should not be limited just to the VIS, but there should be a single operational body managing both SIS II and VIS together, so as to make the best use of the resources and its capacity for work.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third topic is the framework decision on data protection. Here again I must thank Mrs Roure for her report, which gives the Council some encouragement. I put forward the proposal way back in 2005; since then I have appealed to the ministers in Council on several occasions; and today we are getting close to a joint solution. On one aspect, I shall repeat my views, which are well known: I would have liked these data protection rules, which are under the third pillar, to apply to the Member States’ internal legal systems and not just to cross-border exchanges of data and cross-border cooperation. I therefore agree with Mrs Roure's proposal that, no more than three years after the framework decision is adopted, we should re-examine the purpose and scope of these rules and therefore perhaps also the possibility of extending them to the countries’ internal legal systems. Three years is a long enough time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Roure mentions an assessment, precisely the one that we are talking about, in order to harmonise the rules on data protection even more. One thing does not rule out the other: both can be done if we use the report which, three years after the system enters into force, should say whether the mechanism is working, where it can be improved and where further harmonisation is possible. We all ought to agree on one thing, which is the need to rule out any use of the data for purposes not specified in advance; in other words, personal data may be used for police and security purposes only if the categories of purposes for which the security authorities may use them have been set out first. That is a key principle, on which we should stand firm.</p>
      <p sl="it">A debate has yet to be held on the data protection supervisory authorities. Some very careful consideration will certainly be necessary, because the current authorities and the future European authority will have very different attributes, and so more thorough deliberation is probably needed. I have put forward an idea of 15 basic principles to help facilitate agreement. I am very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council considers the exercise of examining the 15 basic principles that I have proposed to be useful. To conclude, we can make up for lost time, but on this topic we are a long way behind.</p>

    <intervention id="3-148" speaker_id="28309" name="Fausto Correia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to make a few brief personal observations on the Prüm Initiative, which Parliament is debating and scrutinising today and tomorrow, and on which I was rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Council’s proposal, presented by Parliament three months ago in almost forensic detail, was debated and analysed with bewildering speed by the committee. To this end – with the constant and total commitment, skill and dedication of the Committee’s secretariat – the idea of a public hearing was proposed, involving all public and private actors, in order to gain a suitable understanding of their concerns. This is a process that seeks to strike the right balance between the demands of effective police cooperation and the defence and promotion of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This exercise in reflection is extremely important given the nature of this proposal, which establishes mechanisms facilitating action on criminal matters and criminal investigations, but which is potentially damaging to the citizens’ rights and freedoms, an aspect that cannot and must not be overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As rapporteur dealing with an initiative of such importance and visibility, my main concerns were, accordingly, to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the demands of effective policing in the fight against the main threats to the very foundations of the EU, namely terrorism and crime, and, on the other, the protection of people’s fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Clearly, striking such a balance and transposing it into a text to be accepted by an overwhelming majority of MEPs represented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who come from a range of political backgrounds, was no easy task, but was certainly a rewarding one. I honestly believe that the proposals to be put before this Chamber substantially improve upon the draft submitted by the Council. I therefore welcome the fact that the amendments we agreed on, which were the result of a broad consensus among the various groups represented in Parliament and of close collaboration between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, were adopted almost unanimously by the committee, with just one abstention. I now hope that they will receive a similarly positive response from this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Among the amendments that have been tabled, I should like to highlight the following amendments for their importance to the economy as distinct from what I feel should be subject to a formal framework decision: greater harmonisation of the conditions of access to biometric databases, ensuring that such access is limited to investigations, and, in the case of fingerprint data, to the prevention of serious criminal offences; clear definition of rules applying to joint operations; establishment of strict necessity criteria so that the transmission of personal data is legitimate, especially when it comes to the most delicate situations, major events and preventing terrorist attacks; extending the scope of the chapter on data protection to all forms of processing data, ensuring compliance with all recommendations put forward by the European data protection supervisor; implementation of a maximum period for keeping personal data; establishment of specific safeguards prohibiting the processing of sensitive data that may be used for the purpose of ethnic profiling; strengthening Parliament’s role in following up the proposal for a decision, in particular when implementation and assessment measures are adopted; and lastly, clarification of the relationship between this proposal for a decision and the proposal for a framework decision on data protection under the third pillar, the latter always being a general regulatory framework in the matter, in any situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, I should like to acknowledge the importance of integrating intervention mechanisms introduced by the Prüm Treaty – undeniably important mechanisms in the fight against terrorism and organised crime – into the EU’s body of law. I must say, however, that I am worried about how the Council will vote on Parliament’s opinion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to conclude by saying that the adoption of the framework decision aimed at stepping up cross-border cooperation, in particular in the fight against terrorism and crime, will clearly lack democratic legitimacy if Parliament’s role is either partially or totally ignored. That would do nothing to enhance the citizens’ trust in the Union when it comes to the process of building the Community; in fact, it would have quite the opposite effect.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I would like to point out that a group of guests have been in the gallery, a group of men and women who are known in my country as ‘war children’. They were children who, between 1936 and 1939, fled Spain, the fascist bombardments, who were evacuated and who found solidarity and care in families in Belgium and the United Kingdom. Today, with all of them over 75 years old, they have come to visit Parliament, to be amongst us, and it is very important and very moving for us to pay tribute to them and, in particular, to pay tribute to the solidarity of the British and Belgian people, who took them in and provided them with the families that they had been denied in their own country.</p>

    <intervention id="3-152" speaker_id="4529" name="Sarah Ludford" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, perhaps I could start by endorsing your welcome to those very important visitors. Before I turn to my prepared remarks – and I will try not to take ten minutes, I am sure to your fervent relief – I am afraid I just wish to start on a slightly negative note, which is that this is billed as a joint debate on cross-border cooperation, combating terrorism and crime. Up on the screen it just says that it is a debate about terrorism. In his introduction, Mr Altmaier said that we were going to talk about three cross-border policing projects. Well, the major part of what I want to speak about is the regulation setting up the Visa Information System, which is a border-management system. Its principal purpose is not combating terrorism and crime. I am sorry, but I take severe objection to the labelling of this debate, because I think sloppy thinking like this is what leads us into the idea that you set up a border control or immigration control database – and let us remember that 99.9% of visitors to the European Union are legitimate travellers who do not have any connection with criminality whatsoever, nor indeed do illegal immigrants or unauthorised entrants. It is not itself a criminal offence to be unauthorised on a territory. I am sorry to take up rather a lot of time making that point.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is two and a half years since the Commission made its proposals on the Visa Information System and we have had nearly a year and a half of often intense negotiations. So I am very pleased indeed that we have reached a strong and balanced agreement on these two highly complex legislative proposals, a regulation and a decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the German Presidency, in particular Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, but also Mr Altmaier, for their strong political commitment to these dossiers, as well as previous presidencies, in particular the Finnish Presidency, which also worked hard towards an agreement. In my long list of thanks, I also want to thank the Commission, in particular Vice-President Frattini, who was very hands-on in accompanying us throughout the process and in facilitating the final agreement. I also know that this result would not have been possible without the support of all the shadow rapporteurs – Mr Cashman, Mrs Klamt, Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Ždanoka – to whom I would like to express my gratitude. Finally, I should like to express my warm thanks to the Parliament staff who put a huge amount of work in and were invaluable. My own assistant, Alexandra, deserves special thanks. She has been absolutely superb.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make an important institutional point. We have dealt here with two proposals, one in codecision and the other in consultation, but in reality we managed to treat them as a package, so we achieved quasi-codecision on the third-pillar measure as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement shows that Parliament is a valid partner in codecision on highly complex justice and home affairs matters. It also shows that the separation between the first and the third pillars is simply inefficient and absurd. Involving the European Parliament on an equal footing in deciding legislation in police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters cannot but increase the legitimacy of the measures decided in this area. So I would take this opportunity to urge leaders gathered for the Summit on 21 June to agree on lifting national vetoes in this area as a general rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the content of our agreement, I think we have managed to achieve what were my goals from the beginning: to have a system with clear purposes, rules and responsibilities and one which represents first and foremost a significant contribution to secure and well-managed borders. It will also deliver real facilitation for lawful travellers, who are the majority of those issued with Schengen visas, as well as an improvement in internal security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has introduced much more clarity and rigour into the VIS, limiting the risk of abuse or malfunction and giving citizens the right to receive redress for mistakes. I am confident the system we have built will deliver both proper security and respect for people’s rights and civil liberties. Many other improvements have been introduced in terms of data protection and data security, fall-back procedures for the use of biometrics, strengthened rules on access, use and transfer, and monitoring powers for data protection authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">One new element represents a very positive achievement by Parliament and should be seen as a precedent. It concerns access by law enforcement authorities to the VIS database. After quite difficult negotiations, Member States did recognise that the VIS is not primarily a law enforcement tool and that therefore any access by police or intelligence services cannot be direct on-tap access, but must be indirect and supervised through filtering by central access points. These will check the legitimacy of each request, though since Parliament is just as concerned as Member States to have adequate tools to tackle crime and terrorism, we have agreed on an urgency procedure for emergencies of ‘request first, justify later’, which will cover exceptional cases of imminent threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">The VIS will become the largest biometric database in the world, with details of around 20 million applicants, at any one time holding 70 million sets of fingerprints. Biometrics can enhance but also invade privacy, and the same rigour that has been applied to the VIS has to be applied to building safeguards for other existing or future biometric systems. This is even more important when it comes to possible future interoperability or even interlinkage, which could put privacy severely at risk, as data protection authorities – including the UK Information Commissioner Richard Thomas – have said.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must make sure as legislators that we do our best to maximise the benefits and minimise the risks of the new technologies. Codecision means co-responsibility, and therefore an important part of the project will be implementation-monitoring and evaluation. Parliament must be kept fully informed on the testing of the system, which I hope will be positive and allow the smooth entry into operation of the system. In EU legislation we are rather too fond of putting in review clauses that remain a dead letter. This must not happen with the VIS.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to finish by highlighting two other important issues. The Council has committed itself through two political declarations to coming up soon with a satisfactory agreement on two crucial pieces of legislation. The first of these is the framework decision on data protection that we are talking a lot about this evening: bringing in proper rules for exchanging the security related data, including that which police will get for accessing the VIS. The second is the so-called ‘return directive’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unnecessary to say why these instruments are so important for Europe and its citizens and I would just urge the Council to keep to its political commitments.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-153" speaker_id="4313" name="Martine Roure" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, police and judicial cooperation is a priority for the European Union in order to fight more effectively against organised crime and international terrorism. We are in agreement about that. More police cooperation, however, entails an increased exchange of data between the competent authorities in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must, however, allow a level of protection of the right to privacy that is at least comparable to that guaranteed in the context of the first pillar. That will make it possible to strengthen the principle of mutual confidence which is the cornerstone of police and judicial cooperation. Indeed, if all the competent authorities know that the data they receive is completely reliable and that the data they transfer is protected in the same way as in their own countries, they will not hesitate to exchange information. This joint discussion is therefore positive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I regret, however, that the Council has not included the need to link the adoption of the framework decision on data protection and the tools for sharing data such as the second generation Schengen Information System (SISII) or the Visa Information System (VIS). In fact, as we have said on numerous occasions, for the European Parliament, it will be impossible to take further the discussions about new exchanges of data without legislation at European Union level regarding data protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I deplore the way in which the Prüm Treaty was negotiated and concluded, outside of all the existing instruments at European Union level. We are, of course, very pleased that the German Presidency has allowed it to be incorporated into the competences of the European Union in order, particularly, to ensure democratic monitoring by the European Parliament. Even so, it is not acceptable for consultation with us about this Treaty, which has clear implications for the protection of the right to privacy for European citizens, to have been rushed. The Prüm Treaty includes some provisions concerning data protection, but these are still not sufficient. The adoption of the Prüm Treaty should also be subject to the adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I should like to thank the German Presidency for its efforts to overcome the deadlock over the framework decision on data protection within the Council. I very much appreciated the very constructive contacts I had with the Ministers, Mr Schäuble and Mr Altmaier, and I should like to thank them. I wish also to thank the Commissioner, Mr Frattini for his helpful support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we can agree on is that the framework decision is a first step for data protection in the third pillar and must not, under any circumstances, allow a level of protection less than that guaranteed by Convention 108 of the Council of Europe and its protocols.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that the Council will emphasise our compromise proposal concerning the scope of the framework decision. In fact, an assessment in three years will, as Mr Frattini has said, enable us to give practical evidence of the need to extend the scope to data processed at national level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I recall also that it is absolutely essential for Parliament to tackle the issue of access and management of data by private persons. We are absolutely committed, also, to the need to establish an adequate level of data protection for all transfers to third countries. To be more precise, it is not a matter of setting up a list of countries where the level of data protection is appropriate. It is not about that, but rather about establishing the adequacy of data protection case by case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The German Presidency recognised our legitimate concern through the adoption of a policy statement attached to VIS. This specifies that the Council is continuing to give priority to the adoption, as soon as possible, of the framework decision on data protection, by the end of 2007 at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I wish to remind the Council that it made a first political commitment for the swift adoption of this text in December 2005 during the discussion about the retention of data. Today, I can say that the European Parliament has great hopes: the Council will keep its promises.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs was required by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to examine the legal basis of the proposal for a Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposal drawn up by the governments that have taken this initiative was based on two articles: Article 30(a) and (b), on operational cooperation, and Article 31, and also Article 34(2c).</p>
      <p sl="es">The reference to Article 34(2c), and the other previous references, implied that cooperation measures could be adopted, but not the approximation of laws, and in reality the text of the proposal involves the approximation of laws.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Legal Affairs took the view that the applicable article would not be Article 34(2c), but Article 34(2b), which allows for the approximation of laws. This proposal, which was approved unanimously within the Committee on Legal Affairs, has been accepted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, and I therefore believe that the proposal is correct and that it should be approved by this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the general public cannot raise much enthusiasm for the European project often casts a shadow over our debates on the future of Europe. What we are initiating now in connection with the Prüm Convention is a major contribution to the bid for a little more support from the people of Europe for this European project. That has something to do with the fact that, by virtue of this Council offensive and the cooperation between ourselves and the Commission, we have managed to take an important issue, namely the public threat emanating from terrorism and organised crime, and go beyond mere speech-making to achieve tangible improvements. We have discussed this on various occasions here in Parliament and in the competent committee and have established that there is an urgent need to act on the question of cross-border police cooperation. Time and again we have expressed regret at not making more rapid progress or indeed any progress at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that, in the domains of DNA-matching and fingerprint-matching, exchanging information could increase people’s security. I am therefore extremely pleased that a degree of success has been achieved with the proposal to bring parts of the Prüm Convention into a European legislative framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me also say in all honesty that I would have hoped for more. In our preceding debates, we had already gone further. May I also say that, at some points, our group would not have gone so far on the detailed weighting of the data-protection structure, because we believe that these additional decisions would not have been necessary, given that the matters in question are already covered by the Prüm Convention. On assessing the instrument as a whole, however – and the rapporteur has already made this point – we ultimately decided to support the project in its entirety, despite our remaining reservations on one or two provisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that this project should have an impact and that we should register a success in this sphere. It will serve to enhance the public image of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is always good to see you in the Chair when we are discussing fundamental freedoms and human rights. I am speaking on the VIS regulation and decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say that after two and a half years it feels as though it is the end of an unrequited love affair. I have admired this dossier from afar; I have wrestled with it, I have caressed it, but I have never felt that it has really returned my passion. I would nevertheless like to thank Baroness Ludford and the other shadow rapporteurs for the close cooperation that we have had.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, two and a half years is not really good enough. We should not be patting ourselves on the back. It is a first reading deal, but progress has been slow. We have before us a good package, but nonetheless if we are to be efficient when we are working in codecision, we need to work more quickly and more efficiently. I have to say that this is a call for greater resources, not only for the Commission, but for the Parliament, both within the committee secretariat and within our own delegation secretariats.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, we have a text which represents a balanced position. It does not include everything that the Socialists would have wanted, but my Group feels it does contain the major elements: limited and proportionate access; data protection rules; the right of appeal, which is absolutely essential; sanctions for misuse and the principle of non-discrimination, which I am proud to say was set in the precedent of my report on the Schengen border code. We are also pleased that the German Presidency can agree to the package of the VIS regulation and the VIS decision, again equally important for us. We also welcome the Council’s willingness to reach agreement on the third-pillar data protection framework decision. This is of prime importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to finish perhaps on a somewhat controversial note: the issue of biometrics and in particular fingerprints. Here we need a change of mindset if we are properly to enhance civil liberties, in particular freedom of movement, and, essentially, the protection of minors who are travelling unaccompanied. I believe this will help us to prohibit the trafficking of minors. Will privacy be invaded or at risk? I do not think so. The risk to privacy is dependent upon the use of biometrics and the storage of biometrics.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Altmaier, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very detailed briefing on the VIS, and anything I might add to that would only water down the good things that have already been said.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, I would like to concentrate on the Prüm Treaty. I agree with my honourable colleague, Mr Herbert Reul, that a sound instrument has been created here. The fact that the data I used to request through the system of official and judicial assistance can now be exchanged digitally makes thoroughly good sense. There is not a great deal to be said on the aim and the idea. I do fear, however, that we are making three cardinal errors – one in the field of internal security, one in the realm of justice and home affairs and one with regard to the third pillar. We believe that speed, per se, is a virtue. We no longer take time to consider whether certain things are actually working or how they could be improved. As far as the third pillar is concerned, we have heard one or two comments today about transparency and democracy, at least with regard to the involvement of Parliament and its right to receive information. The main point I want to make is this: of course exchanges work well between Germany and Austria. We know that successes have been registered there. But now imagine the situation with 27 Member States. Work out the sheer number of possible combinations, what that will mean in terms of the volume of data exchanges and also what a database has to be able to deliver in this context. We do not know whether it is even technically feasible in its present form.</p>
      <p sl="de">My other point is that data, particularly the likes of fingerprints and DNA data, are stored in the various Member States for different reasons. The United Kingdom, as my honourable colleague Sarah Ludford is probably all too well aware, is currently establishing a database that will eventually cover the entire population. At what point does the exchange of such data become legitimate and workable in these circumstances? Cost is another matter. The Member States still have to foot the bill, although I believe that, at a pinch, parts of the cost could be transferred to the community budget – we would have to see what agreement is reached; I know that Poland, for example, takes a different view. I seem to remember reading a document from the Presidency of the Council, which estimated that Germany would incur costs of around EUR 900 000. This makes me wonder how, in its study, the House of Lords could estimate the cost of the project for Britain at some EUR 35 million. Surely there cannot be such huge differences in the way these figures are assessed!</p>
      <p sl="de">Had we not had such an excellent committee secretariat and such outstanding staff, we should not even have reached page 2 in our assessment of the Prüm Treaty and the accompanying parliamentary opinion. Finally, I have a request to make. You have heard often enough that the procedure has come under heavy fire here. It certainly does not accord with the principle of better lawmaking or with the democratic involvement of a third institution. Let us cooperate properly and reasonably in future rather than proceeding in the way that was done with the Prüm Treaty – even if you do have a formal right to exert pressure on us through the three-month limit. It is not entirely conducive to a good working climate either if a senior civil servant from the Council Presidency, when asked in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs what is happening with the parliamentary amendments on Prüm, replies, ‘Well, if we took them into account at this stage and reopened the package that has been sealed with the Member States, we would never make any progress’. That is no way to cooperate. In all other respects, Mr Altmaier, you know that I hold you in high regard!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, terrorism and crime are currently amongst the most serious threats to the daily lives of the inhabitants of the European Community. Clearly, greater cooperation is needed between Member States of the Union concerning the exchange of information on individuals representing a potential threat. It must be borne in mind, however, that sensitive data on Union citizens cannot be made available to police and border guard bodies in the course of standard checks. Of course, as far as possible, the aforementioned services must have access to such information with regard to citizens of third countries. This is particularly true of those countries where criminal activity may be widespread.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Making sensitive data available to the special services and investigative authorities of Member States in cases where it is likely that certain individuals are involved in criminal groups is quite another matter. I endorse the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, namely that this issue should be regulated on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, as some of the provisions of the resolution relate to the sovereignty of European Union Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to speak briefly on the visa-information system. It is undoubtedly something we need. At the same time, I must say that I still have several concerns about the actual structure of the VIS.</p>
      <p sl="de">These concerns relate primarily to the extensive introduction of biometrics. We still have no specific impact assessment, and it is totally unclear whether it is even administratively possible to handle such large volumes of data. That, however, has crucial implications for data security and, above all, for the fundamental rights of every single registered person.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also envisage problems with regard to the access of security authorities to the VIS in the framework of police and judicial cooperation, for there is still no appropriate harmonised mechanism for the protection of data within the third pillar.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, the draft that has now been presented by the German Presidency of the Council is a far cry from the text that was originally approved by Parliament in September 2006, and it falls far short of the level of data protection applicable to activities within the first pillar. For these reasons I cannot support the regulation or the decision in their present form, and I shall abstain from voting.</p>

      <p sl="de">President, the purpose of the Prüm Treaty clearly states that it is to play a pioneering role in the integration of the EU. We all know that talk of combating crime and terrorism is secondary to the real purpose. As a framework decision of the Council, it will become part of the EU body of law, its provisions set in stone and not subject to any real democratic scrutiny or approval. The British Parliament will have no opportunity to prevent the implementation of this Convention, and even this Parliament only has a consultative role.</p>
      <p sl="de">Britain faces a particular danger. For example, it has the largest DNA database in the world with samples collected from over 4.2 million people, many of whom are entirely innocent and have never been charged with any offence. These people are suspects in waiting. This is the creation of a Big Brother Europe by the back door in pursuit of further political integration.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the legal basis for the visa-information system on which we are to vote tomorrow is one of those dossiers that has been finally brought to a successful conclusion after intense wrangling on all sides and lengthy negotiations. It is therefore to be hoped that an important European instrument for the acceleration and supervision of the visa-issuing process will be on its way to the statute book before the summer recess. Exchanges of data on visa applicants from non-Schengen countries between the asylum and immigration authorities and between the border and security authorities will considerably speed up the processing and checking of visas. That will help those bona fide travellers without criminal records who enter the European Union, including those who travel frequently to and from the Union, because they will now obtain a visa more quickly and with fewer formalities, whether they are travelling as tourists or on business. At the same time, it will facilitate surveillance, which is indispensable in a European Union with open internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of the political groups can be satisfied with the outcome. On the one hand, the European Union seeks to ensure that visas are dealt with speedily and hospitably. On the other hand, it seeks to protect its citizens by preventing illegal entry and the associated forms of organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the German Presidency deserves our congratulations for having at long last stirred up the stagnant waters of data protection under the third pillar. However, the same cannot be said for the procedures followed in the case of the Prüm Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="el">The history of the Prüm Treaty is that it got off on the wrong foot, continued on the wrong foot and I hope that it will somehow end well. It was wrong for seven Member States to proceed initially with this Treaty by circumventing the European institutions. It was wrong for another 10 to hasten recently to declare their readiness to join this extra-institutional cooperation. The German Presidency was right to decide ultimately to integrate the Prüm Treaty into the European frameworks, but it is wrong to promote it all of a sudden, without so much as a serious evaluation of its efficacy. It is very wrong to promote it without any valid and adequate data protection framework under the third pillar and it is very wrong to promote it with such haste, thereby undermining in practice the facility for Parliament to play its advisory role in an integrated manner.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite the problems, Parliament has managed to draft a very good report and Mr Correia naturally deserves our warmest congratulations. A series of albeit few but serious safeguards will be adopted tomorrow on the legal and limited exchange, use and protection of DNA and data files.</p>
      <p sl="el">I hope that the Council will adopt our amendments, in order to rescue the credibility of what is, all other things being equal, the necessary – I repeat necessary – cooperation between police forces. This cooperation has over recent years tilted dangerously towards surveillance and repression, without adequate safeguards for fundamental rights. This slippery slope is often tempting in the short term to police forces and governments, but in the long term it is extremely dangerous to the functioning of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very satisfied with the package of proposals that Parliament is going to adopt tomorrow. In recent years we have stepped up efforts at European level to encourage cross-border cooperation in combating terrorism and crime. Ensuring effective exchange of information between national police services is essential in a Europe without internal borders, but I believe that this should automatically imply a higher level of data protection. This is why I also warmly welcome the adoption of the decision ensuring protection of personal data used for security purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Undoubtedly, these instruments will be extremely useful, but the Prüm episode also demonstrates that we now need a global vision for policymaking in judicial and police cooperation. I believe that it is time to stop piling up new laws. Instead, the Commission would be inspired to make an evaluation of the existing legislation in this area. This would allow us to eventually start adopting a coherent approach. In that perspective, it is also crucial to adopt the Constitution that provides for better decision-making in the justice area as it exclusively gives the Commission the right of initiative. In an era when the most exciting hobby seems to be collecting mountains and piles of data, perhaps we should stop for a minute and wonder: is it really used, useful and necessary?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we are taking a stand today in principle on an agreement concerning exchanges between the security services of the Member States of information of a strictly personal nature, on a Treaty which includes joint action by foreign and domestic special services on the territory of the Member States, on the pretext of maintaining public order.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Treaty also includes the provision for joint action by the police and special forces of two or more states at events of international importance – both political and sporting – where demonstrations and gatherings are planned. At the same time, a third Member State is entitled to hand over DNA profiles, fingerprints and other personal data on suspects. However, most dangerous of all is the legalisation of the presence of foreign agents and their action in a third Member State. Services are granted the right to enter and invade the territory of a contracting state in an emergency at any time, even in the absence of any local authority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are good times for those of us who work in the realm of home-affairs policy. On the one hand, we can see progress being made in pursuit of the area of security and justice with the Prüm and VIS instruments, while on the other hand we can also see progress on civil rights with the framework decision on data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to focus on data protection. In the third pillar we have taken a real step forward. I must stress that we in this House, including my political group, have great faith in the public authorities. When we speak of protecting data, this is not intended to sound like distrust. Much progress has been achieved, and the successes connected with the integration of the Prüm Convention in particular are there for all to see. To my honourable colleague Alexander Alvaro I have to say that I am less worried about the anticipated high volumes of stored data; on the contrary, I am delighted that they will enable us to solve thousands of serious crimes in Europe and to give people security.</p>
      <p sl="de">The data-protection framework restores the balance between the existing and necessary powers of our authorities on the one hand and people’s civil rights on the other. There are still many unanswered questions, but we are now taking a step forward. I would like to emphasise that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support a clearly defined data-protection framework, which we regard as a very important objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the end of the day, it was a hard nut to crack. I should therefore like to express my appreciation to everyone involved in the effort: the German Presidency, without which this progress would have been inconceivable, Martine Roure, who negotiated magnificently on behalf of Parliament, and, of course, our Commissioner, Franco Frattini, who lent us suitably vigorous support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would still point out to the Council that a few objections, albeit far fewer than before, are still surfacing in the discussion of the data-protection framework. We hope that a result can nevertheless be achieved and that we can sign, seal and deliver the whole package.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the procedure, let me say that my own personal view is that, in the area covered by the Prüm Convention, we would not have progressed so far in the domain of police cooperation by today if certain Member States had not sailed ahead as flagships, for it took their success to enable us to achieve these present results in the Council. For that reason I have no problems with the procedure. All I would say – and this is also addressed to the Council – is that, when it comes to incorporating the Prüm provisions into EU legislation, the European Parliament must be involved. During today’s proceedings it was noticeable that Parliament occasionally comes in for praise, even though its Members are sometimes recalcitrant. They are ultimately very sensible people, however, and will support sound compromises.</p>

      <p sl="et">The Treaty of Prüm is an excellent example of how the European Union can take rapid and effective action. The need for the treaty is shown by the doubling in the number of states that have joined, or shown interest in, it during the last three months, in other words during the period in which we have been discussing this report.</p>
      <p sl="et">As a quick fix, the partial integration of the Treaty of Prüm into the framework of the European Union is a welcome development. Yet the fact that such an important treaty had to be snuck in through the back door is a worrying symptom.</p>
      <p sl="et">Most Member States did not have the opportunity to have a say in shaping cooperation that is of importance to internal security. This is yet another step towards a two-speed Europe.</p>
      <p sl="et">A two-speed Europe can, however, only be a temporary solution. It is only when the European Union is united that it can be greater than the sum of its Member States. When divided, we cannot even organise a stable energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="et">We did not have enough time to do thorough work to create a stable basis for cross-border cooperation in the area of internal security. That is very unfortunate. In discussing this report, it became clear how poorly the Member States’ practices match each other.</p>
      <p sl="et">We require a common set of rules, especially in the area of data protection, but as long as important problems in the area of internal security fall under the third pillar, there is no cause for optimism.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for the amendments that greatly compensate for the institutions’ unfinished work.</p>
      <p sl="et">Naturally, Parliament cannot simply be satisfied with what has been achieved. Europe must awaken from its period of consideration and move forward decisively.

      <p sl="en">President, I am very pleased that the German Presidency has made data protection in the third pillar one of its priorities. However, I am less pleased if I look at the various proposals that have been circulated. I would urge the Council to take on board not only the recommendations of the European Parliament, but also the criticisms and concerns expressed by the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I am a bit mystified by the fact that we still seem to have 27 different regimes, which creates a lot of uncertainty for citizens and businesses. Secondly, there are so many vague and open definitions, for example on purpose limitation; there are so many exceptions to citizens’ rights and to safeguards, that in the end it seems that this proposal will undermine the position of citizens rather than strengthen it.</p>
      <p sl="en">To give an example, Article 7 on the exchange of sensitive data such as political preference, medical data or data on sex life are supposed to be exchanged ‘only when strictly necessary and with adequate safeguards’. What does that mean? Who is to define what is strictly necessary? What are the criteria? What are the adequate safeguards? That is dangerously open.</p>
      <p sl="en">And a final question to which we have never had a straight answer: we know that the Council and the Commission are having talks with the US on a transatlantic regime for data protection. That in itself is a good thing, but right up to now and despite repeated questions, it is not clear to me what the basis is for those talks. If the basis is the low standards in your proposal for EU data protection in the third pillar, then I am very concerned about the rights of European citizens in our dealings with the US.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise to speak in this debate on one issue only, and that is the Prüm Treaty. In my view, this issue has been rushed through by the Council with what can only be described as indecent haste. The implications of this Treaty are far-reaching and will affect all EU citizens. To give just one example, the provisions of the Treaty could mean that data is shared and exchanged on all EU citizens regardless of whether they are suspected or convicted of a crime. Indeed, the European Data Protection Supervisor, as was mentioned by our previous speaker, has highlighted this and is gravely concerned. In a recent report, he said that the circle of data subjects that can be included in this system is not limited to data on persons suspected or convicted of specific crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Union, where we promote civil liberties and data protection, why are we allowing this to happen? Also, there is the issue of hot pursuit, where foreign police are free to enter other Member States without permission and with powers of arrest, thus negating civilised extradition procedures. In my view this is unacceptable. The system used in the recent World Cup in Germany, where foreign police were sent to assist the local forces but without the powers of executive action, worked perfectly well. To use the English expression, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, this Treaty is a classic example of where a few Member States are trying to impose their system on all other Member States. In this case only eight countries have signed up to this Treaty and we are now trying to foist it upon the rest. We should not be going in this direction and I would prefer to see Member States being given the option to opt into the parts of the Treaty where it suits their national interest and not to seek to have opt-outs or derogations. Unless this is the case, I could not support bringing such a provision into the EU acquis. It is a dangerous and ill-thought-through measure which does little to inform public safety, but does much to shatter public confidence in due process.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it would appear from the debate, both today and on other occasions, that we all agree that everything possible must be done to combat terrorism, organised crime and immigration. We also all agree that there must be police and judicial cooperation in order to achieve results in this sector and we also all agree that information needs to be exchanged between the competent bodies in each Member State for the purpose of the cross-border combating of crime, terrorism and immigration.</p>
      <p sl="el">Where do we disagree? Where is our disagreement focused? It focuses on the point that we must take care of the human rights chapter. We must take care of the personal data protection chapter and there is, I think, no one who disagrees with this position. The question is, where must we draw the line in order to strike a balance between the general public interest and private interests? I am of the opinion that, because we are all sensitive to the issue of human rights, there is no need for an auction; the auction which some people are trying to create or present in this chapter is an insult. I would, however, say this: that academic debate is not needed in the face of reality. The ancient Romans said, 'Primum vivere, deinde philosophari'. Crime, terrorism and illegal immigration are there and we must therefore find ways of addressing this situation without infringing the principle and the right of protection of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, increasing security and fighting cross-border international crime and terrorism entails not only strengthening our common external borders but also rapid and efficient exchange of information regarding border controls and judicial cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Establishing closer police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters and setting up a visa information system (VIS) are similarly important. I therefore support the reports presented to us by Mr Correia, Baroness Ludford and Mrs Roure, and special mention goes to Baroness Ludford for finally achieving an agreement after two and a half years of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The proposal to step up cross-border cooperation includes some of the main provisions of the Prüm Treaty, in particular as regards the fight against terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration, whereby the most substantive requirements of the Hague Programme can be fulfilled. It also contains some improvements on the exchange of information and on the provision of personal data, the protection of which is a fundamental right.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the proposal and support Mr Correia’s view that this initiative should take the form of a framework decision, given that its objective is to bring together the Member States’ laws and regulations. On the other hand, the VIS should be the third major system supported on computer technology to be created as part of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the fact that agreement has finally been reached, in such a way that we can press ahead with setting up such a vital system, which will improve the administration of the common visa system, consular cooperation and consultation between the central consular authorities, will help prevent threats to internal security and visa shopping, will facilitate the fight against fraud and checks at the external border posts and in the territory of the Member States and, lastly, will contribute towards identifying and returning – I stress the word ‘returning’ – illegal immigrants, thus facilitating the implementation of the Dublin II Regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has succeeded in adopting a unified stance on the Prüm Treaty. The compromise amendments indicate that certain issues still remain to be considered by the Council, however. In this way, the European Parliament is making it clear that the chosen method of negotiation in a small group and the attempt to introduce provisions adopted earlier into Union legislation is not an appropriate way to proceed, and this should be emphasised. This method fails to afford equal treatment to Member States, bypasses Parliament and gives rise to serious legal, organisational and political concerns. It should therefore be the exception not the rule, and also serve as a warning not to proceed in that way with regard to other third pillar issues in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Everyone is agreed on the need for a visa system to ensure better implementation of the visa policy. It is important to understand that adoption of the legal basis is only the beginning. We are all aware of the history of SIS II. Pressure was applied to ensure swift adoption of the legal basis and then serious problems regarding technical implementation emerged at a later stage. An effort must therefore be made to put this legislation into practice and implement specific actions so that the visa system can come into operation in the spring of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, concerning Mrs Roure’s report I should like to say that surely we are all now hoping that it will prove possible to reach agreement with the Council on this issue. The protection of what is very often highly sensitive personal data under the third pillar should not be weaker than the protection of such data under the first pillar. I am aware of the legal limitations we have to take into account, and I trust that the compromises reached in Parliament will become binding legislation at the earliest opportunity. I also hope that they will no longer be an obstacle to the introduction of SIS and a single visa management system at the agreed time.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Therefore, I consider it highly significant that at the informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held in January 2007 in Dresden under the leadership of the German Presidency, an initiative was announced regarding the transposition of the Prüm Convention into EU law.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Important elements of the proposal are developing reciprocal access to special databases, the development and operation of national contact points, and the high level of data protection. I would like to emphasise police cooperation in border regions, and carrying out joint operations as well as cooperation in cases of events that draw large crowds and in the event of catastrophes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I consider it regrettable, however, that the proposal omitted the scope of actions that can be taken in the event of immediate danger, as well as the issue of air marshals, the struggle against illegal immigration, as well as the broader range of rules for police cooperation along border areas.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Every person must be guaranteed the right to live in safety. At the same time, in the interest of protecting personal data, I consider it to be necessary to specify, in relation to the rules for the transmission of data, to which crime-fighting body the data requested may be submitted via the central contact points. It is, moreover, necessary to develop the good practice of achieving the requisite level of data protection, while the automatic use of the latter does not impede the desired exchange of information among the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">I will abstain in the vote on this report mainly because the UK is not a part of the Schengen agreement and as such I should not be involved in determining policy in other Member States. However, I also recognise the difference in jurisprudence in the UK in contrast to other Member States. This issue of compatibility has broader implications and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. I will be interested in the outcome of the court rulings on this issue. I recognise the positive aspect that this system will bring to security; however, the dangers are also relevant and need to be taken into account. Thus the broader implications of the Visa Information System make me hesitant to approve or denounce its implementation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Institute for Gender Equality is currently being established in Vilnius, and it should begin operations this year. As you know, Slovakia and Slovenia also wanted this institute to be founded in their capitals; the decision adopted was favourable to Lithuania, though, and it was also endorsed by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, then came an incident when the city managers of Lithuania's capital Vilnius refused to issue a permit for the promotion of the anti-discrimination campaign – in other words, they did not allow the entry of the ‘Euro Truck’, which is already making its fourth trip across Europe distributing information about the campaign ‘For Diversity. Against Discrimination’ and about the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. When the European Commission issued a statement about the decision of this city's administration, there was some speculation that the European Commission might be having doubts about whether it is worth establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I am absolutely certain that Vilnius, which has since antiquity been famous as a city of tolerance, truly deserves to be the headquarters of the European Institute for Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would also like to stress that not one country is beyond reproach when it comes to the subject of human rights and freedoms, and every Member State of the EU has much to do in the fields of tolerance and the struggle against discrimination based on race, ethnic background, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion and so on. Let us work together.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, for some years jellyfish have been invading the Mediterranean shores. Many people have to be treated for stings, which cause pain, inflammation and other disorders. There are even some places where the authorities advise against swimming in the sea. This plague is a symptom of the imbalance being suffered by the Mediterranean ecosystem.</p>
      <p sl="es">The abuse of certain fishing practices is leading to the disappearance of species such as bluefin tuna – which compete with jellyfish to consume zooplankton — or the loggerhead turtle, which are their natural predators.</p>
      <p sl="es">The warming up of coastal waters – a result of climate change – and their higher salt content – as a result of a lower intake of fresh water due to drought – also contribute to this over-abundance of jellyfish. The experts warn that it is necessary to tackle the problem immediately; otherwise it will increase year on year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The government of my country – Spain – is implementing studies and action plans. We are faced with an environmental problem that affects all of the coastal States and that needs to be tackled at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="es">This problem is having an extremely negative effect on the tourist industry throughout the Mediterranean basin, and this Parliament and the other Community institutions must therefore pay more attention to it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to some measures taken by the Romanian Government this year aimed at improving the fight against corruption. Romania is now the first country in Europe to adopt a law that allows monitoring of the wealth of all high-level government and public officials, conflicts of interests and incompatibilities. Reforming the judiciary is not an easy task that can be tackled from one day to the next, nor can it be done by one person. Such a challenge requires strong political will, determination and collaboration between the government and the parliament. The current government is determined to continue the judiciary reform process in Romania by guaranteeing a total independence of the judiciary in full accordance with the commitments made towards our EU partners and most of all towards Romanian citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that the Commission report on Romania to be presented at the end of this month will acknowledge the progress made by the Romanian Government in the judiciary reform process and in the fight against corruption.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there has been much discussion today about recognising Kosovo as an independent state on the basis of the will of the population living there. I do not believe that argument provides sufficient justification for independence. This is because account should be taken firstly of historical circumstances, secondly of the interests of the nation as a whole and thirdly of international order. We should recall that Kosovo is the cradle of the Serbian nation. We have all heard of the Battle of Kosovo Field.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we now proceed to recognise the independence of Kosovo on the basis of the will of its population, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdinistra will soon follow hot on Kosovo’s heels. We might also have to deal with the creation of an Islamic Republic of Southern France in 2020 with its capital in Marseilles, as some predict, and with the emergence of a Paris Emirate in 2050. I feel bound to warn against the adoption of a rash decision on the basis of the will of the majority of the population resident in a particular area.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as a medical doctor, I set great store by transplant surgery, which saves the lives of many patients who would die if they did not receive a transplant. It must be said, however, that Mr Kyprianou’s statement on the introduction of the directive laying down minimum standards and the European organ donor card, notably as regards the deletion of ethical amendments from a range of Union documents, may well lead to various kinds of abuse, particularly in view of the fact that euthanasia is legal in several European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European organ donor card and especially presumed consent in an environment of moral laxity carries with it the risk that no effort will be made to heal the sick, and that their lives may even be terminated in order to obtain organs, as recently stated in the press. In such circumstances, consent to organ transplants after the donor’s death should be confirmed with the consent of the deceased family and those closest to them once they are in receipt of a document confirming brain stem death. This would go some way towards preventing abuse.</p>

In proceedings that have been pending against me, there is a quite unequivocal opinion of the Director-General for Finance with crystal-clear conclusions. Mr Rømer denies its existence. That is what he is saying officially; internally, he is saying the opposite. Lies are being told.</p>
      <p sl="de">I demand that this investigation be made public and accessible. Moreover, in these proceedings, in which I am trying to defend myself judicially, Mr Rømer is denying me access to translations of various documents held by the Secretariat-General, again on the flimsy pretext that there are allegedly no definitive official translations.</p>
      <p sl="de">My work is also being severely obstructed by the fact that a personal assistant, who had already received a written acceptance, is being denied me in the grouping of non-attached Members.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, three weeks have now elapsed since the EU-Russia Summit in Samara, at which Poland once again refused to consent to the adoption of the Union’s mandate, a sine qua non to opening negotiations on a new agreement. The reason was that Poland believes the Finnish proposals on support and involvement in resolving the trade dispute with Russia are inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It has now become abundantly obvious that the Polish embargo is not just a problem for our country, but for the European Union as a whole. We are therefore pleased that the Union has strongly supported our decision, emphasising the value of the principle of solidarity. It should be borne in mind, however, that the embargo on Polish meat and plant products has now been in force for over 18 months, and that Polish entrepreneurs are those most affected. How long can such a situation be tolerated?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ongoing and intensified dialogue is essential for a successful resolution to the conflict. Failure to make any progress so far at a bilateral level indicates that the support of Union diplomats is needed to achieve a solution. The transition from theory to practice should be made at the earliest opportunity and a way out of this impasse must eventually be found. Unfortunately, the length of time elapsed suggests we are still treading water as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">On 9 May 2007, the Romanian Senate adopted a law setting up the National Integrity Agency. This agency will carry out verification activities in the following areas: wealth, conflicts of interest and incompatibilities. Furthermore, the Romanian Government has modified the law on the establishment of the National Integrity Agency in order to make it more drastic. The new Justice Minister supports this project and considers the agency to be an efficient instrument as a result of its investigative power, its civil sanctioning power and the guarantees for its independence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, an interesting meeting between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Horst Seehofer, the German Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection took place on 5 June. Mr Seehofer is the current President of the Council, and he made a clear presentation on the need to depart from the common agricultural policy and speed up the European Commission’s work in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the things we learnt was that milk quotas will cease to exist after 2015 and that temporary difficulties may ensue. What all this amounts to, therefore, is that the common agricultural policy is most likely to remain in place only until the new Member States are in a position to receive full payments. A host of questions spring to mind. One of the most important is: why were we not informed of this in the course of negotiations on accession conditions? Another important question is: why was preparatory work on changing the common agricultural policy started without first reaching agreement with the Member States and the European Parliament in view of the fact that the consultation formula is supposed to apply?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in 2005 one of my constituents, Mr Michael Davidson, had a quantity of cigarettes and alcohol and his motor car seized by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs when re-entering the UK at Dover. Their justification is that, purely in their opinion, he intended to use the goods for commercial purposes, something he strenuously denies. Such seizures are illegal under Council Directive 92/12/EEC.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2006, Commissioner Kovács postponed proceeding against Her Majesty’s Government in the European Court of Justice on the understanding that it would comply with the law. However, HM Revenue and Customs are still illegally seizing goods and refusing to restore the monetary value of goods previously seized. The British Government has subjugated British citizens to EU law, but choose to ignore it when it applies to them.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a particularly dangerous phenomenon that has arisen during work on the directive on consumer credit, and which significantly diminishes the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process as laid down in the treaties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament was heavily involved in work on the document. Many requests were made to the Commission and to the Council to undertake studies on the impact of the directive on the Union’s economy, including banks and consumers. Despite all this, the Council and the Commission consistently refused to undertake such studies. Parliament therefore undertook its own studies, believing that such a directive should not be adopted without the certainty that it would be beneficial, to prevent it becoming one more bureaucratic imposition on Member States. The Council and the Commission took no account whatsoever of Parliament’s studies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is therefore worth considering why Parliament’s voice went unheard. More importantly, it is also worth asking the question as to why a draft directive that will have such a great impact on raising costs for banks, and which might not necessarily improve the situation for consumers is supposed to be adopted without the relevant investigation into its appropriateness and impact on the Union’s economy.</p>

That is how we do our business in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is now three years since the new Member States acceded to the European Union, but they are still being discriminated against in terms of budget appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector. Amongst the many instances of such discrimination one stands out, namely the size of the payments allocated per hectare of land devoted to cultivation. In 2005, the old Member States received EUR 560 per hectare, whilst the new ones only received EUR 20 per hectare. The poorer countries therefore receive 28 times less support than the richer ones. Sadly, this is how solidarity and the opportunity to even out economic levels translate into practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Discrimination against the new Member States in the fruit and vegetable sector also has a negative impact on consumers and agriculture across the entire Union. I therefore appeal for a vote in favour of the adoption of the amendment to Mrs Salinas García’s report tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. This amendment does at least partially reduce discrimination against the new Member States, and its rejection would be damaging to the common agricultural policy, and to the principles and aims of the latter. Rejection would also indicate that the old Member States are incapable of building a strong European agricultural sector.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Claire Gibault, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the social status of artists (2006/2249(INI)) (A6-0199/2007).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as Mrs Gibault is not available this evening, she asked me, first of all, to convey to you her apologies and her regret for being unavailable and then, to present this important report in her place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there exists a universal bond that brings all of us together, as European citizens, beyond our differences, it is indeed culture. Europe is today on the way to achieving its goal, as it has managed to play its role in facing up to globalisation in order to preserve its identities and cultural diversity. The European ‘cultural exception’ is, today, on the way to becoming universal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Gibault made a commitment when she was elected to this Parliament, to intercede with the European authorities on behalf of all European artists. This report has given her the opportunity to do so, through my speech this evening and all the work that she has done. She wishes me, in this connection, to thank on her behalf all the shadow rapporteurs and all the many colleagues, who have worked alongside her and taken part in the final drafting of this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The choice of the theme of the situation of artists in Europe imposed itself upon her: it was something she felt very strongly about because of her profession and her occupation as an orchestral conductor. Like Albert Camus, she is convinced that we have to choose to put culture at the centre of our model of society, that we must make creative activity and free access to culture one of our European priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Contrary to generally accepted ideas, most of the difficulties encountered by artists are not solely of a cultural nature, but they are linked, often, with their mobility, with visa policy, with health, with social security, with problems of unemployment and pensions. Mrs Gibault considered practical measures to improve the daily life of artists and she proposes, in particular, the introduction of a specific visa which would make their mobility easier. She thought of a European professional register to combat illegal employment and, also, a European Social Security card with an electronic chip to make it easier to piece together artistic careers. Mrs Gibault proposed also the publication of a practical handbook for artists which would contain, in a parallel text, the welfare provisions relevant to them laid down by European institutions and their application in different Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">She stressed the need to promote formal artistic education, since for all of us, that is an issue that poses a real European cultural challenge. Therefore, without the willingness of the European Union to put in place specific policy in relation to artistic education, it is easy to see that there will be no progress in gaining audiences and making access to culture more democratic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Her report was, therefore, voted for unanimously on 7 May, in the Committee on Culture and Education. It is innovatory and represents real progress for artists, as it takes into account both their precarious situation and the need to retain flexibility in their activities and proposes solutions giving artists the prospect of more continuity in their future and, therefore, of greater peace of mind.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tomorrow, some amendments will be put to the vote, in particular two amendments that Mrs Gibault feels strongly about, because they would give a new impetus to creative artistic activity and would stimulate risk-taking in the sector, which is very much in need of it today. As her report says, moreover, in order to make progress on these aspects, it is a matter of analysing above all the results of the relevant survey by the Commission, taking into account the advantages and the drawbacks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Community law, when looked at more closely, has not been as indifferent towards culture as one might imagine. Mrs Gibault has included in her report an idea already developed, in their time, by Victor Hugo and Alfred de Vigny, according to which artists, after their death, can continue to contribute to the support of their contemporaries. The international provisions to which the Union has subscribed authorise Member States to take the measures necessary to protect their cultural heritage,which is built up, among other things, by works that are free of copyright, that is, those that become out of copyright 70 years after the death of the author and 50 years after the first performance of a work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Gibault looked into this idea. She proposes the view that it would be sufficient, in a spirit of cultural solidarity at European level, for Member States to examine, each one for what concerns it, a way of deducting a part of the revenue generated by the commercial exploitation of works and using it to fund artistic creation and improvement in the social circumstances of European artists. That would enable the emergence of new support to foster innovation and pluralism and to encourage new forms of cultural expression. That is a very fine vision of intergenerational solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I should like to quote these words, which Victor Hugo, once again, spoke at a public meeting before French Members of Parliament: ‘We are all one family, the dead belong to the living, the living must be protected by the dead’. What finer protection could you wish for?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Gibault, an artist herself, for preparing this very important report, and Nathalie Griesbeck for introducing the report tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">When celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, I think we realise how much culture is at the heart of the European project. We have programmes and projects at EU level that encourage artists’ mobility in Europe and thus strengthen intercultural dialogue in the European Union. For example, in 2006, which was the European Year of Workers’ Mobility, we co-financed three projects focusing on artists’ mobility out of a total of 41 projects funded over the year. These projects led to better acknowledgement at EU level of the various obstacles to artists’ mobility. It is a first step, and I know that if we are to improve the situation of artists in Europe, many challenges still lie ahead of us concerning lifelong learning, work permits and social status.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last month, I proposed a communication on culture with the title ‘A European agenda for culture in a globalising world’, which was adopted by the Commission. I presented this communication to the Committee on Culture and Education and to Ministers at the last Council meeting. The objective is to involve all stakeholders – Member States, European institutions and the cultural world – in a shared agenda of priorities for the years ahead. Improving the status of artists, which is linked to improved mobility and the circulation of works of art in the European Union, is one of the strategy’s key challenges. It is a prerequisite if we want to succeed in having a European cultural space. Therefore I am looking forward to working closely with you on this issue, and especially with the Member States, because responsibility in this regard is primarily at national, regional and local level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning back to the report, I particularly welcome the emphasis on lifelong learning and retraining. Initial education nurtures the first spark of an artistic vocation, but continuing to retrain is the key to ensuring artists’ social situation in a rapidly evolving economy of the arts. As you know, strengthening the links between education and culture is also one of my objectives because I propose to designate 2009 ‘European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. Work is under way to prepare a Eurydice survey of cultural and artistic education at compulsory school level in Europe. This is one step towards improving our knowledge base and I hope that the Year will stimulate research and the development of a stronger and wider evidence base and evidence-based policy and practice in relation to education in the arts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to stress that the issue of the status of artists in Europe is a very broad topic, which cannot be dealt with in isolation by only one Commissioner responsible for culture. Therefore, within the framework of the communication we proposed last month, I will work closely with my colleagues responsible for employment, justice and the internal market in order to ensure that the specificities of the cultural sector are duly taken into account in other EU programmes and policies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Gibault for all the work that she has put in to this report. The Commissioner, Mr Frattini, has recently announced his draft directive concerning the European green card to attract highly qualified foreign workers and allow them to live for five years in the Union and to move about in it without a visa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last November, we learned by means of a survey ordered by the Commission, that there is, on European Union territory, a professional category of about 5.8 million European citizens, representing 3.1% of the working population and with a turnover of EUR 654 billion; these professionals work quite legally and are, nonetheless, treated as illegals in many Member States: I am talking about artists and professional performers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of us enjoy going to a concert, to the theatre or to the circus but, as our leisure time finishes, the artists’ work continues, for some applause, often a meagre wage and almost always difficulties with the tax and social security offices. I congratulate our rapporteur, therefore, for getting to the bottom of what goes on backstage. Having said that, this is not our first attempt because, in 1992, Doris Pack already drew up a very full report, as did Mrs Vaz da Silva in 1999. And what about the initiatives of cultural organisations to encourage mobility and recognition of the status of artists? This report is not an outcome but a beginning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, just when we have approved the Unesco Convention and the Commission has just submitted to us its strategic agenda for culture, it is time to act. Commissioner, I urge Member States and the Commission to tune up their violins and without further ado attack the countless technical and practical problems. In this, you are not alone, Commissioner, we know that, but the initiatives suggested in this report must be implemented as well as the two others that I have just mentioned. That is enough of fine words, let us have some action!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this morning on the plane from Budapest to Brussels I met the Director of the Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra. He congratulated me on the Gibault report and told me how satisfied he and his colleagues were with it. The congratulations should go to Mrs Gibault, who worked hard in a good spirit and with good intentions on this very important subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of us respect artists and recognise their important contribution to European culture. We should help them by improving their social status. It is crucial for them to have information on the various social arrangements in the different Member States, for instance, in terms of health insurance systems and unemployment and pension provisions. In fact, some of the new Member States provided rather good social conditions for artists during the so-called ancien régime, but that changed during the transition period. Time spent by artists on rehearsals should be considered effective working time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The free movement of artists, and employees in general, from the new Member States is still not ensured. Visa facilitation for third-country performers is important, but we must give priority to the free movement of all citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the report. My fellow Socialists and I will vote for it. However, as a Member from a new Member State, I have to call for free access to the labour market for every European citizen.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should also be mentioned that some leading Hungarian artists refuse to travel to the United States owing to the degrading treatment inflicted by the American border authorities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the good offices of Mrs Griesbeck I should like to pass on my heartiest congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Gibault, who has done an excellent job. With the benefit of her experience in the sector, as an orchestral conductor, she has been able to identify the main obstacles that artists face in their careers. I fully agree with her when she says that no artists are ever at any moment in their career totally immune from job insecurity, and it is precisely because of that that more targeted measures are needed to protect artists and operators in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">The specific nature of artistic activities requires that the Member States’ legislative framework should be amended so as to guarantee the status of artists, but harmonised EU measures are also needed, above all to facilitate their mobility. It is also vital to establish the basis for a homogeneous training system to ensure that the qualifications granted are recognised throughout the European Union, to secure an increasingly high level of professionalism in the teaching of the arts, and to encourage this through exchanges and networking for teachers and students on the model of the Erasmus programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, a proposal that I find interesting and worthwhile is for a specific temporary visa for artists to facilitate the mobility of European and third-country professional artists when carrying out their activities. Besides, the universal languages of art are known to be an outstanding vehicle for the promotion of cultural, social and human values.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, I shall be supporting the rapporteur’s two amendments when this Chamber votes tomorrow morning, particularly Amendment 20a, which aims at providing new kinds of aid for artists through a suitable fund set up with the proceeds of a levy on the commercial exploitation of copyright-free original works and their performance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the status of artists has always aroused interest and generated lively debate. Those responsible for work on their status have all made the same mistake, however. They have overlooked the fact that amateurs, including popular artists, work alongside professional artists. They have forgotten that national cultures are founded on popular culture, which is sometimes known as traditional culture.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should bear in mind too that changes in our civilisation are accompanied by the disappearance of many traditional occupations and skills. The latter are important for the preservation of the national cultural heritage. The planned European Charter for activity in the field of artistic creation should therefore also cover popular artists and craftspeople. In addition, we should welcome the plan to create a common database that would help to promote the mobility of artists working in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as you might expect, there are many areas of concern to me in this report but sadly I have time only to look at one. In her report, Mrs Gibault proposes a pilot scheme of registration cards for artists. Could this be the thin end of yet another wedge? Will this then be rolled out to apply to all professions and trades? Will we all then require a card before taking up employment? Could you then be prevented from taking employment in your chosen field, as is the case with photographers from other countries in Germany, unless you have a permit? And who will organise this, pray? More bureaucrats?</p>
      <p sl="de">Just as over-regulation stifles business, so this proposal will suffocate art. Indeed it will ensure continued foreign dominance in the fields of art and entertainment largely from the United States. I predict that this, if passed, will be another example of the laws of unintended consequences.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, what is an artist? What is his place? Marginal or central? Well-known or unknown artist? Always misunderstood, damned and poor or famous and rich? Darling of the elite or pariah of the consumer society? Scrounger at rich men’s tables or on the revolutionary barricades? Picture of despair or image of happiness?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is an artist? A person who has a taste for the arts, a love of what is beautiful? If that is how it is, what is the artist to do in a society that produces ugly things? Hide away in his ivory tower or go down into the street among the angry crowds? If the artist has a status, is he going to resolve his dilemma or plunge it still further into confusion? While we examine the artistic creator from every angle, the other one, the supreme Creator, protects him, saves him and inspires him.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have spoken about the artist as citizen: that is just propaganda! We have spoken about the artist as witness of his age: that is a definition of an art critic. For my part, I think he is the seismograph of this society. We can help him by making laws for him, but we shall be plunging him into artistic bureaucracy. This is because things that are new for us now, for the artist, have already been experienced, assimilated and consumed.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate Mrs Gibault, a highly-regarded artist in the world of opera, who has taken advantage of her role in the European Parliament to shed light on the problems faced by artists due to the different social systems in the Member States. I should also like to congratulate Mrs Hennicot for her valuable guidance in the final decisions taken by our group on this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="el">Most of the difficulties faced by artists are not of a cultural nature, but are connected with mobility, health, social insurance, unemployment and each artist's pension rights. The Commission must turn its attention to the current visa and work permit systems for artists and draft legislation in this area and in this sector. In addition, a study must be carried out, at European level, in the aim of analysing the provisions adopted by the Member States in order to safeguard compensation for holders of author's and related rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">Artistic creation contributes to development and helps to maintain the cultural heritage; it helps to acquaint us with new trends in the arts and in the progress made in the states, especially between young artists. Society and the state, at both national and European level, must help to support creation by and the social and economic protection of artists because, as we know, art is not a commodity. It is therefore the duty of all of us to protect its expression and to strengthen creativity in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Gibault on this report, the objective of which is to study the problems and difficulties faced by people working in the arts sector in general, in terms of issues such as health, social security, unemployment, retirement and also mobility, and, if possible, to provide solutions to them.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am not going to talk about these issues – previous speakers have already done so – but I would like to refer briefly to artistic studies. Firstly, we must stress their importance, and hence the need to pay attention to education in the arts from childhood.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I would like to point to the need for the Member States to recognise diplomas and certificates awarded by national arts conservatoires and schools, with a view to a gradual convergence and, if possible, also a convergence towards the Bologna objectives in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, I would like to stress the importance of promoting regulated studies in the arts that are comparable with other official fields of study recognised by the Member States, with a view not just to enabling students to enhance their artistic talent, but also to helping them to be trained and qualified in other professional fields. The cultural, artistic and performing arts sector needs that, in order to ensure that the expectations of students of the arts are not dashed. This requires investment in the cultural fabric, in infrastructures, in promoting arts training and cultural activities.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the Member States will pay the necessary attention to this report, which can be an immense help to these people.</p>

      <p sl="sl">In Europe we like to take pride in the fact that our cultural diversity and exquisite works of art are part of our identities. Yet we rarely mention the fact that these artistic works were often created by impoverished artists, who received no proper payment during their lifetime and who only enjoy posthumous fame. Even today there is no shortage of artists who, owing to the complicated procedures involved in obtaining work permits or in calculating their years of work, find themselves on the margins of survival, even though their works are magnificent and highly regarded throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since culture and art rank among those fields that do not only bring spiritual enrichment but also major commercial benefits and many jobs, it is utterly unbelievable and quite intolerable that today’s top artists also have to struggle with issues of survival and social insecurity. For instance an artist in Slovenia is also an artist in other parts of Europe, and it would be a great pity if administrative barriers were to confine him exclusively to his own country thereby depriving the citizens of other Member States of the opportunity to enjoy his work.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In the area of education and in the European labour market we place great emphasis on mobility, something that is particularly important for artists and the users of art, and which makes a significant contribution to intercultural dialogue and the mutual cohesion of nations and cultures in the European Union. It would therefore be right for Europe to take some important steps here and to harmonise legislation to the extent that it will become usable and more understandable for the layperson, or to introduce at least some appropriate instruments that will contribute to the greater mobility and social security of artists.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, this report from Mrs Gibault sets the same priorities that Parliament set on the basis of my report 15 years ago and of Mrs Vaz da Silva’s report eight years ago. One really has to ask how often Parliament must restate these same demands before anyone actually responds. I was pleased to hear just now that the Commissioner might indeed take a small step in the direction we proposed 15 years ago. Some things do take a long time!</p>
      <p sl="de">This report says that a review of the social status of artists must be undertaken. The difficulties and obstacles in the sphere of visa policy that impair the mobility of artists must be clearly defined. I know that Parliament is currently working on the visa rules, and I hope that artists will also benefit from this new regime. That has long been our cherished wish, and I believe this improvement is now well under way. The social status of artists is about their social security and about unemployment and pensions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Back in the 1992 report we were demanding a status for artists. Just imagine – 1992! Where was Slovakia then, Commissioner? Back then we were already trying to make suggestions regarding the fiscal treatment of works of art and to achieve harmonisation for the works of artists, particularly as regards value-added tax. We tried to create a fund. We tried to create an identity card for artists. All that back in 1992! All of these things are now being called for once again. I learned as a teacher that everything must be repeated so that the lesson sinks in. In the present case, however, everything has sunk in so deep that it no longer resurfaces. Allow us, therefore, to whisper a word in your ear, Commissioner, and not in your ear alone, for this is actually a matter for the Member States. That is why today, just as in the past, we are again calling on the Member States to look for ways in which they can provide special support.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report in those days was much bolder than the one we venture to present today, because we are afraid that some provisions might not be implemented and because we have become far more cautious now. We must measure our democracies by how much we do for the arts, by how much scope we give them. Claire Gibault has identified ways in which the measures we ought to take can be implemented by the Commission and the Member States. I wish her the best of luck in pursuit of that goal.</p>

Aş dori să insist asupra unor idei conturate în raport pe care le consider extrem de importante, dar şi realizabile. Sunt convins de necesitatea unui Euro-pass, un registru profesional european pentru artişti care să consemneze activitatea acestora. Documentul ar veni în sprijinul mobilităţii specifice acestei bresle. În ceea ce priveşte această mobilitate, trebuie să facem o distincţie netă între cea a artiştilor şi cea a lucrătorilor în general. De aceea, solicităm statelor membre să elimine orice restricţie privind accesul pe piaţa muncii pentru artiştii din noile state membre. Totodată este esenţială recunoaşterea reciprocă de către statele membre a diplomelor şi certificatelor eliberate de către instituţiile de învăţământ de profil. Aceasta ar facilita atât schimburile la nivelul studenţilor, cât şi la nivelul artiştilor profesionişti, precum şi posibilitatea de a fi angajaţi pe baza acestora. Nu putem accepta nici situaţia în care artiştii europeni care lucrează în afara Uniunii să nu-şi poată transfera drepturile de pensie şi securitate socială la revenirea în ţara de origine din motive pur birocratice şi, de aceea, solicităm o iniţiativă şi în acest sens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was struck by your decision, Mrs Pack, to criticise the lack of action by the Member States and the Commission even though you had first put this idea forward 15 years ago. It would be even worse, however, if you had to say what you have just said in 15 years’ time: ‘I proposed an artists’ statute 30 years ago.’ With Mrs Gibault’s initiative, something is bound be done to improve the situation. I shall now start the speech I have prepared.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe, Mr President, all the citizens in the 27 Member States hope for something. If they are workers they hope to have a future and if they are elderly pensioners they hope to have a secure present. Among them there are also artists, who perform an activity that very often provides entertainment and enjoyment for so many other millions of citizens who watch them, listen to them, like them and enjoy their performances.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our current goal, however, is for artists to be considered workers with the same rights as all workers; artists are human beings and workers and, as such, are entitled to working conditions worthy of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">How many artists are there who do not become famous, who humbly perform their artistic work every day and do not receive a fair reward or due respect, and will not have a fair pension?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank you all for a very interesting debate. I believe that this report will help to boost not only dialogue, but also cooperation in Europe in favour of artists’ creativity and culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">I liked the approach of Mrs Pack, because she is very enthusiastic and usually those people are far ahead of the developments, but we need such an approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 1992, 15 years ago, most people, especially the Member States, did not want to touch culture, because subsidiarity is a sensitive subject. Now people want to do more through culture, because other realities are there: the market, the euro. The problem is rather intangible. I do not say that we need harmonisation, but we need better conditions for cultures to flourish in order to build understanding, intercultural relations and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, last Monday’s communication was the first in 50 years where the Commission set a kind of political manifesto and proposed a common cultural agenda. We propose to organise a kind of annual forum, the Davos Forum, which will bring together Member States, stakeholders and the European institutions to discuss, move forward and provide answers to cultural issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning new programmes – Erasmus has been mentioned a few times – this year we will have three times as many opportunities to increase mobility or triple the intensity of Erasmus. However, we need compatibility of studies or recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications. I proposed last autumn – and this is also in Parliament’s and the Council’s ‘European qualifications framework’ – making our qualifications more readable, comparable and transferable. Please make your contributions in autumn or by the end of this year, under the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, there have been many calls for visas. Visa facilitation is already in place, and I hope the Member States – with the exception of Ireland, the UK and Denmark – will enforce such visa facilitation for students to improve mobility of students and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">For workers, which means professionals, in September we want to bring forward proposals on two important directives. The first is a proposal for a horizontal framework directive on the basic rights of all labour migrants. This proposal will provide for the creation of a combined residence and work permit in order to reduce administrative red tape. The second is even more important in this respect, because of what many of you have said. It is a proposal for a directive on the admission of highly-skilled workers. This directive may, in certain cases, directly apply to third-country artists and grant them facilitated access to EU labour markets. We can go back 15 years or 5 years, but now is the time to move, and together we can do something.</p>

The Constitutional Treaty can play an important role not only in increasing the importance of the European Union in world politics, simplifying Community law and decision making, and increasing transparency and thereby its accessibility to citizens, but can also help create an enterprise-friendly business environment and complete the internal market. The creation of a Constitution is also a competitiveness issue. It is a response to both external and internal challenges.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The treaty accepted in June 2005 contains the basic values of the Communities that have taken shape over the course of their development to date, as well as common and Community policies the safeguarding of which is in the interest of the whole project of integration and of each Member State and EU citizen. The Constitutional Treaty was signed by the head of state or head of government of each Member State, and in 18 of the Member States the ratification process has also taken place. Despite the unsuccessful referendums in France and the Netherlands, we must not postpone the potential for integration that underlies the creation of the Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The efforts of the German Presidency to launch the preparatory work for a new proposed treaty are welcome, and the European Parliament wishes to play an active role in this process. The proposed treaty that is now to be worked out should contain as few changes as possible, and should continue to ensure the protection of the aforementioned Community values.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, I consider it important for the modified treaty to be given a more thorough, longer term and objective information campaign in each Member State, funded partly from Community sources, in order to secure a higher level of popular acceptance. In this information campaign, a prominent role should be entrusted to the European Parliament and its deputies, who represent the interests of EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Zdzisław Kazimierz Chmielewski, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (COM(2006)0411 – C6-0281/2006 – 2006/0134(CNS)) (A6-0163/2007).</p>

    <intervention id="3-227" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joe Borg" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Chmielewski, and to both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the report. The objective is to have the proposal agreed at the June Council next week. During discussions held in the context of the Council preparations, many changes have been introduced to the original proposal, some of which go in the direction of your suggested amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are well aware, both cod stocks in the Baltics suffer from over-exploitation, with the eastern cod stock falling so far below safe biological limits that it may be in risk of collapse in the near future. At the same time, ICES has indicated that misreporting of catches occurs in 35 to 45% of cases in the eastern Baltic, which not only results in an additional unaccounted fishing impact on the stock but also affects the accuracy of scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current situation not only harms the cod stocks in the Baltic but is also threatening the fishing sector reliant on this resource. Cod is one of the most important fish stocks for the industry in the Baltic. It is therefore crucial, not only from an ecological but also from a social and economic perspective, to bring fishing into balance with resource availability as soon as possible, so that fishers can once more count on stable and high catches.</p>
      <p sl="en">The multiannual plan presented by the Commission has been developed on the basis of past experience with managing cod fisheries in the Baltic and on several consultations held with stakeholders, Member States and scientists. It aims at rebuilding the stocks not only towards safe biological limits but even beyond, to levels that will provide the highest sustainable catches, thus providing stability in the long term for the fishing sector concerned, by reducing total allowable catches and fishing efforts step-by-step to the levels corresponding to this objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning now to the report, the recitals of the plan correspond to the measures that are later outlined in the actual provisions. I can therefore only accept Amendments 1 and 5, which correspond to the provisions of the plan, such as the request to specify the status of the eastern cod stock in the first recital. Amendment 4 is acceptable in principle. However, the split into western and eastern parts is determined by scientific evidence that there are two separate cod stocks in the Baltic, and not by the ecological features of the two areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report proposes several amendments to the rules outlining the procedure for reducing total allowable catches and fishing effort to sustainable levels. Amendments 8 to 11 would result in a mitigation of the reduction process and would limit its application.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the serious situation of the stock and the need to limit all types of fisheries catching significant amounts of cod, I cannot accept these amendments. I am, however, aware of the need to define a system that the industry can deal with. The Commission has therefore changed its plan by combining the summer ban and the days absent from port. This will increase flexibility for the industry, and will thus particularly benefit small-scale fleets, for which a fixed and rigid system is more difficult to work with. Moreover, an article on the European Fisheries Fund has been included in the plan to ensure financial compensation for the industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Changes to the effort system mean that several of the provisions on control and monitoring have also been changed. The margin of tolerance has been raised to 10%, except for cod, and the rules on discharging have been deleted, which should correspond to the provisions of Amendments 14 and 16 of the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Amendment 15, the rules on entry and exit from the area have been changed as well, meaning that the specified requirements apply only where the vessel is leaving the area in which it has been fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As misreporting is presently one of the key problems in the management of the Baltic cod fishery, it is crucial to improve these rules to monitor comprehensively how much is taken from which cod stock, and when. For similar reasons, I cannot accept Amendment 13, which limits the requirement for a log book to vessels with a special permit for cod fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report proposes to reduce the valuation period from three to two years and to introduce a provision on the monitoring of the socio-economic impact of the plan in Amendments 17 to 19.</p>
      <p sl="en">New cod recruits enter the fishery at the age of two to three years on average. If an evaluation began during the second year, it would be very difficult to detect any effects on the stock and, consequently, on the industry. The Commission is, however, planning a project that will monitor not only the ecological but also the socio-economic impact of the plan as a first step towards the impact assessment to be made in the third year of the application of the plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I turn to the three amendments tabled by Mr Schlyter last week. They are not acceptable to the Commission for the following reasons. The objective of the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy is to ensure sustainable management in ecological, social and economic terms. It is therefore the Commission’s responsibility to strive for a balance between these three pillars, albeit based primarily on scientific advice regarding the stocks. I thus consider a gradual reduction of TACs and fishing efforts until target levels are met, as advised by ICES, to be a good balance in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">ICES also recommended using relative targets such as fishing mortality instead of fixed ones such as biomass, because they are less sensitive towards scientific uncertainty and the environmental variations affecting the stock.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current situation whereby a high level of misreporting is interfering with management and scientific advice and in view of the possible upcoming revision of the biomass reference points for the eastern stock, the inclusion of biomass targets is not appropriate. However, as an expected outcome of the plan is the improvement of the basis of scientific information, the inclusion of biomass reference levels could be considered in the course of the revision of the cod recovery plan, which is envisaged to take place after the plan has been in force for three years.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Council regulation which is the subject of this report is a long-awaited important legislative proposal, and constitutes an attempt to deal with the very considerable needs of the fisheries sector in one of the most significant bodies of European water. This in itself is good reason to congratulate those responsible for the report. They have tackled the difficult challenge of drafting a long-term programme for the regeneration and catches of Baltic cod. Cod is a fish that provides many families with their livelihood. It is the most important fish in the Baltic and therefore generates great interest amongst those involved in fisheries. Emotions are running high in the Baltic region concerning Parliament’s opinion and subsequent Council rulings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A report referring to verified data taking scientific forecasts on the development of cod stocks and fishing possibilities as a content-related starting point represented an opportunity for achieving satisfactory compromises in these circumstances. It was essential for the Committee on Fisheries to intervene with regard to the Council’s legislative proposal because it was necessary for the document to take account of the inevitable socio-economic consequences of the planned catch restrictions. I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the amendments adopted was tabled by the rapporteur and bound the European Commission to monitor these consequences and propose essential management measures to Parliament. Another amendment adopted involved reducing the restrictions on fishing days laid down in the regulation from 10% to 8% and increasing the so-called reporting limit from 100 kg to 300 kg. I am referring to the Committee on Fisheries. The Committee on Fisheries also adopted the suggestion made by the Council of Ministers regarding adjustment of the margin of error in fishing log book entries from 8% to 10%. The proposal on increasing the minimum size of cod caught in the Baltic to 40 cm was endorsed too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is difficult to avoid the impression that report was strongly influenced by the view that the fishing capacity of the Baltic cod fleet is currently far too large in relation to the available fishing quotas. There is still no proposal for a systematic resolution of this problem at the level of the Union and the individual Member States. Stronger and stronger warnings are being voiced urging great caution with regard to automatic decisions on scrapping the fleet. It would be preferable to seek solutions allowing the fishing capacities defined to be retained until stocks are replenished. We shall obviously need something to fish with when that time comes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that sooner or later the issue of the length of the summer bans will become part of the debate on the plan for rebuilding cod stocks. The Commissioner referred to the bans today. It should be noted that a tendency to favour so-called days absent from port rather than the bans used to date is gaining strength in those Member States seeking ways to further reduce the fishing effort by introducing additional days when fishing for cod is banned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The scientific advice accompanying the general discussion on the Council regulation has indicated the need to review the assessment of biological reference points used to date, and I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this today. It should be added that none of the Baltic countries queries the introduction of fishing mortality as a method of defining the achievable aims of the multiannual plan for rebuilding Baltic cod stocks. I refer to Article No 4 of the plan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It does seem essential, however, to launch an in-depth debate on the subject of appropriate values of biomass reference points adjusted to the actual state of the stocks and the current general situation of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This will be in line with the Community’s commitment to introducing the ecosystem approach to fisheries management. I refer to Recital No 5. I should emphasise that the biomass limit values currently in force were adopted in 1998 on the basis of data gathered in the 1960s and 1970s. They cannot therefore be appropriate to the current condition of stocks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the intention of the earlier Council Regulation 2371/2002 mentioned in the document dealt with in the opinion was to retain the precautionary principle in connection with the introduction of fundamental changes to the fisheries policy. The precaution applied to both management of the stocks and assessment of the socio-economic impact of the changes. This principle should remain in force following the accession of the four Baltic countries to the Union.</p>

    <intervention id="3-229" speaker_id="28126" name="Christofer Fjellner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety">
      <p sl="sv">Thank you, Mr President. As the person in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety responsible for cod fishing, I wish to begin by complaining that so few of our views are included in the report on which we are to vote tomorrow. We have a shared responsibility for ensuring that it is possible to fish for cod in the Baltic Sea in the future too. The situation where cod is concerned is a serious one. In spite of reduced quotas, cod stocks are close to critical level. If we are to prevent stocks from collapsing completely, we need still stricter distributions of quotas. These quotas need to have a scientific foundation rather than be based on long drawn-out political wrangling, as the focus in fishing must in the first place be on the environment and on a long-term approach, not on short-term labour market policy objectives. I am only sorry that the Committee on Fisheries appears to think in precisely the opposite way.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission’s proposal for reduced fishing quotas is a step in the right direction, but it will be of no help if we do not make sure that it is complied with, because the greatest among the many threats to cod is illegal fishing. It is said that between 35% and 45% of the total share of cod landed has been fished illegally. What is most important, therefore, is not new rules but guarantees that the existing rules are complied with. It is therefore incomprehensible to me why the Committee on Fisheries refuses to accept, for example, my demands that strong measures be taken against those countries that close their eyes to illegal fishing. What, moreover, is most terrible of all is that we know which countries they are.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am convinced, however, that, in the long term, we need an entirely new system for fisheries policy – one that makes fishermen themselves have a sense of responsibility for the survival of cod. One system that has shown itself to be effective is that involving individually transferable fishing quotas. Fishermen should be given an incentive of their own to take responsibility for the survival of the stock. I believe that, in that way, we can obtain a better fisheries policy in the EU. Annoying as it is that the Committee on Fisheries does not appear to want this system, it is gratifying that the Commission seems to take a positive view of the possibility of introducing individually transferable quotas.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In conclusion, I would just point out one thing I do like about the report by the Committee on Fisheries, namely that it incorporates my proposal for an increase in the minimum size of the cod that is caught. This would give the fish more scope to reproduce and would make for more stable stocks. In common with my fellow Swedish Conservatives, I unfortunately cannot, however, vote in favour of the report before us today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, against the backdrop of the decline in Baltic cod stocks identified in the ICES studies and of demands from the relevant fishing crews for operating conditions that will enable them to preserve their livelihood, I would like to commend the work of my honourable colleague, Mr Chmielewski. He has had to do the splits in order to reconcile the Commission’s proposal and sustainable fisheries on the one side with the resolute demands of the fishermen on the other.</p>
      <p sl="de">If sustainability is to be more than an empty word, however, it must be reflected in working practices on fishing vessels and in personal attitudes to scientific prescriptions. Accepting catch quotas is one side of the coin. In particular, this means not only fulfilling the prescribed basic conditions but also supporting the new measures to improve stocks and more effective supervision by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, supervision is a weak point in some Member States. There is sufficient untapped potential in this area. The involvement of regional advisory bodies is not only helpful; it is also an urgent necessity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposal from the Commission therefore points in the right direction, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports both the proposal and the rapporteur’s efforts to strike a fair socio-economic balance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I appeal to all those in positions of responsibility to take good heed of the information provided by ICES and other scientific bodies when fixing the total allowable catches and quotas for cod and devising measures to halt the decline in cod stocks. The Baltic is a sensitive sea, and we should bear that in mind whenever we consider any measure.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you, Mr President. The situation for cod in the Baltic Sea is a very serious one. For 2007, the ICES has recommended that no cod be fished in the eastern part of the Baltic, yet in spite of these recommendations a considerable quantity of cod will be landed. Where western stocks are concerned, 30% more than the recommended number will be fished, and in addition there will be unreported and illegal fishing. The Committee on Fisheries is trying to water down the Commission’s proposal, which basically does not consider the consequences for biological diversity, either.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As always when fisheries issues are debated in this House, the socio-economic consequences of fishing are referred to. Certainly, a ban on fishing for cod may harm professional fishermen. However, overfishing means that, before long, there will be no fish left to catch. In the era of globalisation, it is necessary to be flexible and to be prepared to make structural changes in society. Tomorrow, I shall vote against Parliament’s proposal, even though I believe that the Commission’s proposal is unsatisfactory too.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I myself live on the Baltic Sea and have therefore been able to monitor at close quarters how bad things are there. The situation not only causes a deterioration in people’s quality of life, but also, as Commissioner Joe Borg himself pointed out, threatens economic development along the whole of the Baltic Sea coast. People throughout the EU expect us, in this House, to make vigorous efforts to save the eco-systems in our seas. I should therefore ideally have liked to have seen the House support a ban on cod fishing, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion. A ban would also have made it simple to get to grips with the illegal fishing that quite a few Members have talked about. There is obviously no majority in favour of this in the House at present, but I nonetheless hope that a majority is able to support Amendments 20 to 22, one of the provisions of which is that the largest permitted catch shall be based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. That really should go without saying. The fact that we do not act on the basis of existing scientific knowledge is one of the reasons for the current threats to cod and to the whole of the Baltic Sea’s eco-system.</p>

    <intervention id="3-234" speaker_id="28980" name="Andres Tarand" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="et">The Baltic Sea is an inland sea and, thanks to its poor connection with the open seas and oceans, it is a very distinctive sea. The limited water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean unfortunately also means that the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable – the sea lacks the ability to dilute large quantities of pollution and, what is more, fish stocks recover very slowly there after overfishing.</p>
      <p sl="et">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we discussed at great length the topics of overfishing for cod and illegal fishing in the Baltic Sea. The committee agreed that cod fishing should be prohibited for some time in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea or that a zero fishing mortality rate should be established. The objective of this would be to permit cod stocks, which are in very bad condition, to recover, so that they might later be managed sustainably once again.</p>
      <p sl="et">I regret that the Committee on Fisheries has not taken that one key position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety into consideration in connection with managing the cod stocks of the Baltic Sea. It should also be in the long-term interests of fishermen to halt fishing at the moment, so that cod stocks, which are in a critical condition at the moment, might recover.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would firstly like to thank you for the number of points that have been raised. I think it is clear that we share a common objective, that of ensuring the long-term sustainability of cod stocks in the Baltic and thus the livelihood of the fishers in the region. While we may differ on the means of achieving this objective, I have no doubt that our aim is the same. On the specific points raised, I would like to make the following points.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we must propose schemes for effort limitations and take into account the effort exerted by small-scale fleets since their catches represent around 50% of total catches. We are, however, ready to consider flexible mechanisms in order to enable them to apply the plan without it being too much of a burden. I would like to stress that the eastern cod stock has been declining continuously over the last decades, as has the average catch size. The serious situation of this stock is therefore self-evident and, while it is crucial to take account of the socio-economic perspective, it is primarily the ecological status which requires recovery, that is of paramount importance. In this regard, an annual reduction of 10% has been identified as the minimum in order to be able to detect changes in the development of the stock status or the sector deriving from the plan. A decrease of the annual reduction would also confront the sector with a longer reduction period and therefore delay the benefit of bigger and more stable catches and would make it unlikely that the MSY levels can be reached before 2015, as is required under the Johannesburg Commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it is important to underline that control is the key issue, particularly in this fishery. We hope to reach a solid and workable solution to this issue in the Council next week.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on the report (A6-0202/2007) by Mr Itälä on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2008.</p>

    <intervention id="3-239" speaker_id="28313" name="Ville Itälä" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first I wish to thank all the coordinators, the shadow rapporteur and the representatives of different groups for the excellent levels of cooperation they have shown and the desire to find compromises. This was evident when we last voted on the budgetary guidelines in this plenary. We achieved a vast majority in all the important areas regarding general issues.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would, however, like to start by saying that I hope the President will convey my remarks to Parliament’s Bureau regarding how this process is advancing. In my opinion, it has not gone the way we had hoped, because it so happened that when the Committee on Budgets was voting on the guidelines, Parliament’s Bureau was at the same time voting on the estimates, which are the subject for discussion here today. One might easily get the impression from this that the Bureau is not really bothered at all about what the Committee on Budgets does, because it was already one step ahead. Things cannot go on any longer in this way in the future. We really need to work more closely together and check what either body is doing.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As for the budget’s content, there is an extremely important basic principle here, already approved in connection with the guidelines, that the 2008 budget will remain at the 2007 level. To this, obviously, we have to add the figure for inflation and deduct from this the cost of any buildings projects, which will in any case be a cheaper option than renting in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now it appears, however, that various projects are being sought in this area, constituting new items of expenditure. When the proposal mentions ‘justified needs’, that certainly does not mean that it is enough if a project is convenient and agreeable: it has to be really necessary for the business of this House and from the point of view of the taxpayer.</p>
      <p sl="fi">2008 is the last year this Parliament can show the taxpayer that we really can save and operate responsibly when we are drafting the budget. We can show that we will not embark on any new projects unless they are really necessary. Now that there is no enlargement and there are no new languages, these projects must be kept to a minimum. It is most important, however, that we are able to show the taxpayer that this is an accountable institution. The people of Europe and European businesses have to think carefully about what their money is going on and count every cent and euro. Parliament needs to act by way of example. It cannot act in any other way. Otherwise, credibility will fade and afterwards it will be a lot harder to get different things done and there will be far less confidence in Parliament. So now is the right time to gain trust and act responsibly.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One example of the sort of thing we need to put right and of the sort of project we can put money into if we need to is the adjustment concerning translations. We have to ensure that committees receive translations in sufficient time, and I support this proposal by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Hopefully, it will have the greatest possible support.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would finally like to speak about information policy. I have prepared a proposal that Members of Parliament should be able to spend resources on inviting here small and local media, which do not have the funds themselves to send journalists here. This is a way of getting as close to the people as possible. I know from experience that these journalists want to talk to Members of Parliament and write articles about what Members think about issues and why they vote in a certain way. Accordingly, I have put forward such a proposal to consider using small and local media specifically, and I hope that there will be even greater consensus on this than what there is at present between the groups.</p>

Codecizia a devenit regulă generală astfel că, până la 80% din legile adoptate în statele membre reprezintă acte votate în acest for. Responsabilitatea Parlamentului faţă de cetăţeni este mai mare ca niciodată. În consecinţă, toată munca desfăşurată în Parlament trebuie să fie la înălţimea acestei responsabilităţi.</p>
      <p sl="en">Raportul subliniază că prima din priorităţile pentru 2008 este asigurarea de servicii eficiente pentru membri, în vederea unui proces legislativ eficient. Datorită recomandărilor acestui raport, vom avea traduceri în toate limbile din cele 20 de comisii ale Parlamentului. Mai mult, munca noastră va fi comunicată mai bine printr-un post de televiziune propriu şi va fi creat un program prin care jurnalişti din presa locală şi regională vor putea veni în Parlament pentru a duce informaţia europeană în comunităţile lor. Însă, cea mai importantă resursă a Parlamentului rămân oamenii care lucrează aici. În acest sens, am depus un amendament la raport care vizează tocmai personalul acestei instituţii şi mai exact numărul insuficient de angajaţi din statul pe care-l reprezint.</p>
      <p sl="en">În urma aderării României şi Bulgariei, Secretariatul general al Parlamentului şi mai mult, practic a decis că un număr egal de agenţi permanenţi, şi anume 113 pentru fiecare din cele două ţări, ar fi necesar în serviciul instituţiei. Aceasta este o problemă pentru că, procentual, mai puţini tineri români pot obţine un post în Parlamentul European deoarece populaţia României este de aproape trei ori mai mare decât cea a Bulgariei. În acelaşi timp, europarlamentarii români de două ori mai mulţi decât cei bulgari, pot conta pe serviciile tehnice ale unui personal insuficient, fapt ce poate afecta eficienţa muncii noastre. O anume proporţionalitate a fost întotdeauna respectată în Instituţiile europene. Parlamentul a ţinut cont în trecut de considerente precum mărimea delegaţiei sau a populaţiei statelor membre, iar Oficiul de personal al Uniunii Europene, EPSO, a scos la concurs anul acesta un număr semnificativ mai mare de posturi pentru cetăţenii români, şi anume 440 faţă de 275.

      <p sl="sk">() I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and express my thanks for the excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Last month the Committee on Budgets was addressed by marketing experts, and they agreed that WebTV is an excellent information tool for European Union citizens. The project must therefore be completed as soon as possible. In the committee we agreed that small local media should be more involved in the activities of the European Parliament. This will increase the awareness of European Union citizens about the work of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We differ, however, on how these media should be engaged. One school of thought suggests that funds should be allocated to each Member so that they could invite journalists working for local media to the European Parliament. My political group is not prepared to support this approach to cooperation. Therefore, on behalf of MEPs for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we are submitting an amendment proposing to adopt clear rules of the game governing communication with local and regional media. The idea is, on the one hand, to bring over to Brussels and Strasbourg as many local journalists as possible; and, on the other, to ensure that our procedures are clear and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Colleagues, you all undoubtedly wish for your work to be efficient. You want to be in a position to demonstrate to your voters that you use the available funds as efficiently as possible. However, it is frequently the case that crucial documents which Members receive for committee deliberations are only available in one or two languages. If, as a result, another extraordinary meeting of the committee needs to be convened, this negatively impacts the entire process and is inefficient. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the above I trust that you will support this amendment designed to avoid such shortcomings and a pointless increase in costs.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the guiding principle that Mr Itälä has set for Parliament’s 2008 budget, namely that the budget should be kept at the 2007 level, allowance being made for inflation. It should not be higher than this without special reason. This is because 2008 is, of course, a year of consolidation after the enlargements and the extra appropriations that resulted from those enlargements. Now is the time to review matters and keep a constant eye on the opportunities to effectivise and prioritise our administration. There are, of course, new needs. There are things that can be done better. That applies to translation and interpreting, where it is not always possible for Members to get the service they need, and it applies to the needs for professional assistance for legislation work, which are also on the increase. In addition, the European Parliament should develop better communications tools, such as web TV, to make it easier to follow Parliament’s work.</p>
      <p sl="da">As a guiding principle, the money for these improvements should be provided within the budgetary framework mentioned. The Bureau, however, has now decided to fix the preliminary draft estimates at EUR 1.49 billion, which corresponds to 20% of the EU’s administrative expenditure. This is, of course, the amount that we are setting as the upper limit for the budget. At the same time, reserves totalling EUR 55 million have been set aside for real estate policy and new political priorities, with EUR 10 million going to the election campaign for 2009 and a good EUR 14 million being set aside for unforeseen expenses. Parliament’s Presidency, however, does not provide any further details about what kind of projects they have in mind. In the ALDE Group, we have always supported the real estate policy. It is a good thing that Parliament has bought buildings at the most advantageous time, rather than continuing to rent. We also support the campaign in advance of the election, but we do not think it reasonable to put forward a budget containing such large and unexplained sums. The budget must reflect the actual needs and present a clear and transparent view of the economy over the next few years. There is thus a job for Mr Itälä to do, and I wish him luck with negotiating a more realistic budget. Parliament should take a lead and exhibit a level of budgetary discipline at least equal to what we expect and demand from the other institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">în numele grupului ITS. – Apreciez în mod deosebit raportul privind estimarea bugetului de venituri şi cheltuieli pentru exerciţiul financiar 2008 elaborat de Ville Itälä cu un înalt profesionalism, îl susţin şi o să recomand colegilor din grup votarea acestuia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Separat de aceste consideraţii de ordin general, dar fără a le exclude, o să menţionez câteva aprecieri de natură particulară care nu fac decât să accentueze caracterul consistent al raportului.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pornind de la ideea că bugetul pentru anul 2008 ar trebui să fie un buget pentru contribuabilul european, am apreciat preocuparea raportorului faţă de necesitatea ca acesta, contribuabilul, să fie informat cât mai în detaliu asupra tuturor activităţilor Parlamentului şi, în special, asupra viitoarelor alegeri europene. În acest sens, deosebit de oportună mi se pare propunerea raportorului privind elaborarea unui program special de informare, al cărui principal destinatar şi beneficiar să fie format, în special, prin structurile media locale de mai mică anvergură. De asemenea, consider că propunerea raportorului privind aprobarea unor surse financiare care să permită realizarea unor întâlniri directe cu ziariştii locali în Parlament este deosebit de valoroasă şi o susţin fără rezerve, deoarece apreciez că este unul dintre cele mai eficiente mijloace de a face cunoscute, direct şi în deplină transparenţă, toate activităţile acestuia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Din lipsă de timp, o să mă limitez la a mai menţiona un singur aspect din raport şi anume acela al multilingvismului. Sunt întru totul de acord cu raportorul că acestui deosebit de important domeniu trebuie să i se acorde o atenţie particulară, având în vedere posibilele efecte datorate interpretării eronate a textelor ca urmare a unor traduceri mai puţin exacte a acestora. Tot în acest sens, consider că, în special reprezentanţilor noilor state membre trebuie să li se asigure un suport lingvistic corespunzător proporţional cu numărul acestora din diferitele structuri unionale.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() The European Parliament certainly does not come cheap. The total cost – in excess of EUR 1.427 billion– is quite substantial, and it is imperative that all budget headings and allocations be clearly justified.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this regard, however, the estimated revenues and expenses of the European Parliament in the 2008 budget year include a fair number of unknowns and are therefore something of a pig in a poke. In his report the rapporteur properly identified, I believe, some of the bottlenecks; by the same token, one can only agree that the extent of mopping-up transfers has been quite substantial.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In 2005 mopping-up transfers totalled EUR 124 million, while in 2006 they amounted to more than EUR 105 million. This is nearly 10% of all budget allocations. Parliament’s call for administrative bodies to estimate better the necessary allocations within expenditure groups is therefore certainly appropriate. I also warmly support the idea of developing a specific programme to raise awareness about the European Parliament’s activities by bringing small local media into the system. Such media are less gossip-prone and can properly inform citizens about decisions taken by European institutions, including the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for whose benefit are we actually holding this debate, and who is our addressee? I am disappointed to see us talking amongst ourselves here about things we discussed long ago. What right have we to stand here with no interlocutor listening to us? If the Commission took the liberty of discussing its budget in the absence of the competent Commissioner, we would be singing a different tune. I am personally deeply disappointed at the way in which both the parliamentary administration and the Bureau are dealing here with the Committee on Budgets and its members.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me move on to the core message regarding the budget in the European Parliament. What is the core message we have to convey to our electorates? It must be that we are fully committed to our mission of legislating for Europe as well and as efficiently as possible and at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. Better working conditions for Members of Parliament are essential to the accomplishment of that mission. They must be at the heart of our deliberations. Outward appearances are all very well, but the substance of our policies is still more important than their presentation and packaging. For strong substance, however, we need a proper research service to enable us to make better laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">When preparing for European elections, we need not only an administrative campaign but also more scope for Members to employ staff. That requires a degree of flexibility. How has the European Parliament implemented the reformed and less bureaucratic Financial Regulation that has been in force since 1 January 2007? I get the impression that we have never had so much paperwork in this House. Nor has there ever been such a lack of clarity. The Statute for MEPs and the pension fund are still unfinished business. What I wish from the parliamentary administration is a satisfactory solution to these outstanding issues rather than high-flown plans for interparliamentary summits or museum buildings. I can hardly wait for the advent of Web TV to see whether it shows how few Members take part here in the work of Parliament.</p>

This is an absolutely unforgivable error, of which I hope there will be no repetition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should also like to say that I am concerned at the way in which the translation sector is being managed. I cannot understand how it is that people who have worked normally for 10 or 12 years can be told that they will no longer have work, simply because they did not receive the draft contract they usually receive every December. This is no way to treat people and it contravenes all of the principles of social Europe. I should like to say that this kind of procedure is not acceptable and I call on you, Mr President, kindly to pass on this message to the Secretary-General.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wish to thank our fellow Member for her report with regard to which, however, I am completely in agreement with Anne Jensen in her observations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to mention, this evening, just one of the fundamental points, to my mind, that this report highlights. It relates to information policy, which makes it possible to communicate effectively with the half billion citizens that together we now comprise. In this respect, I will say in my turn that I support one hundred per cent the grant provided to encourage the new policy on local media. Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, we need to stimulate a new kind of European public debate which transcends national borders and is taken up throughout Europe, and for that we must put into effect three major projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the European Parliament’s Internet television channel must rapidly become a reality which will bring us closer to our fellow citizens and which will create more transparency in our work. Secondly, we have to use all the new means of communication. For example, tomorrow I am organising a discussion forum on the Internet from Brussels with secondary school pupils from Dijon within the framework of a Franco-German project. Thirdly, on a cautionary note, I should like to say that the establishment of a visitor centre in Brussels must not cover up the lack of facilities for groups of visitors during the plenary sittings at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and we need to think about that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, regret that such scant attention is being paid to what is on the table here, but presumably for different reasons from most of you. You should actually rejoice that so few people are being made aware of what is being served up here once again. I am convinced that there is nowhere else in the world where people are so highly rewarded for such scant output as here in the European Parliament, whether they be Members or officials.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you look more closely at the wasteful items, you will see a 60% growth in unforeseen expenditure and a cost explosion under the heading of fitting-out work on buildings from 17 million to 27 million, chiefly for architects’ and engineers’ fees. I am convinced that the rapporteur, who just nodded to me, is trying in good faith to keep the lid on this expenditure, but the large political groups and the majority in this House simply will not let him.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not know where you come from, nor do I know whether I shall succeed one day in rekindling the sentiments with which you perhaps first entered politics, that idealism which I would never question in anyone. But what are we doing here with one and a half billion? Every one of us surely knows that we would get by on half that amount. There is no desire to save money, however, but only to waste it. Then we have Mrs Gräßle saying that there should be more staff. The one who is probably the only severe critic of such profligacy here is not even given a single assistant! I tell you, if the public really knew what was going on here, they would not describe this as a democratic parliament but as a den of despotism and wastage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do believe that this parliamentary debate serves a very useful purpose. The fact is that those who bear responsibility are sitting here. I think it is important to be master in one’s own house, and that means having proper working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">When I consider that the meeting documents we are given here in the House have to be taken into the Chamber in paper form, I must conclude that our working methods are not up to date. It really goes without saying that the necessary computer equipment and Internet access should be available to us here at our workplaces so that we can perform our work properly and thoroughly here in the Chamber too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Other facilities are lacking in the House, such as suitable consultation rooms. When we receive groups of our constituents these days and try to hold proper discussions with them, we do not really have the sort of premises we need to accommodate seven, eight, nine or ten people. One of our tasks here is to make the requisite improvements to our own working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would also be useful if the public could see how individual Members of this House operate here. It would do no harm if we had a Web-TV transmission now and the next day were given the viewing figures for the various debates we had held. It would emerge very clearly that the citizens of Europe certainly do take an interest in what happens here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the same reason it is also important to appeal to a wider range of journalists. I rate our Brussels correspondents very highly, but a great deal more must be done, including contributions to education and training programmes for journalists in Europe, to nurture a more objective understanding and assessment of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Recently the European Parliament has, to the great delight of us all, been fulfilling an increasingly significant role in cooperation among the European institutions and, what is more, it has been gaining ever greater recognition in the eyes of European public opinion.

      <p sl="hu">In order, however, for our information policy, which in addition to web TV includes hosting visitors groups, holding exhibitions and operating information offices in the Member States, to have its desired result, we must back these policies with appropriate sources, that is to say, budgetary resources.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the one hand as the quaestor responsible for this portfolio, and on the other hand as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I hope that the European Parliament will be able to take a unified position on this question of financing, thereby ensuring the successful realisation of this policy, which is of importance not only for the European Parliament but for European popular opinion.</p>

I agree with bringing local journalists over, but all news is local, as is all politics, and Members of this Parliament have a huge amount of work to do to translate those big documents that have been presented into real stories that affect real people.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are currently in the final and decisive phase for the approval of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector. We launched the debate on 24 January 2007 and since then we have received lots of very valuable input, not least from the European Parliament and the report of Mrs Salinas García. I thank you for this and for your constant support for the general objectives and the general principles of the Commission proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">When considering the substance of your opinion, I have chosen to focus on a few issues to which you have given very special attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, on producer organisations, it is clear that both the Commission and the European Parliament believe that producer organisations should be maintained and even further reinforced in order to increase the degree of the concentration of the supply. This is absolutely fundamental if the sector is to match the huge concentration that we see these days in the retail sector. As you know, we have proposed a number of new initiatives in order to make our producer organisations much more attractive. We have proposed additional Community financing of 60%: firstly, for mergers between producer organisations and associations of producer organisations; secondly, for regions where the level of the concentration of the supply through producer organisations is below 20%; thirdly for organic farming; fourthly for new Member States and, finally, for the outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am aware that you have requested even more action to be included in the additional Community financial assistance of 60% to the operational funds, such as joint action between producer organisations or integrated production. However, what we have proposed will already make a very positive difference. I should like to stick to these measures in the first place. As you surely know, we also need to be attentive to the budgetary constraints.</p>
      <p sl="en">On crisis prevention and management, I agree with you that it is one of the most sensitive points of the reform and I should like to thank you for the ideas that you propose in your opinion. However, I cannot accept the idea of a separate fund for crisis management and the need to define what we actually mean when we talk about a ‘crisis’. A separate fund would result in a substantial budget increase and, moreover, will not contribute to further simplification.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the use of a percentage of the national reserve for crisis management, this is not acceptable either. The national reserve was created at the very beginning to accommodate particular situations in the framework of the single payment scheme and it is not appropriate to devote this budget to another objective or other measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I understand your call for more flexibility in order to facilitate crisis management. Rather than making a completely separate structure, I should therefore positively consider adding more flexibility to the structure proposed in our initial Commission proposal in order to make the scheme as efficient as possible and to avoid a major decline in prices. Nevertheless, I want to underline that we also need to bear in mind that any modification of the current proposal has to respect the overall budgetary constraints, as well as the need for simplification.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the inclusion of fruit and vegetables for processing in the single payment scheme, you have requested an optional transitional period, in particular for tomatoes. You are also in favour of a separate payment for tomatoes for historical producers in the new Member States. I am open to accept a short transitional period in which Member States could decide to grant aid per hectare. Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that full decoupling must be both the precondition and the end goal – so final decoupling at the end.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also aware that the soft-fruit sector is facing difficulties. The Commission analysis has shown that fragmentation of both production and marketing has contributed to the difficulties faced in recent years by the soft-fruit sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of this report we have considered that the best way to address the problem is to add incentives to increase the number of producer organisations in the new Member States, which is what we did in our original proposal. Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivities of this soft-fruit sector, I am open to considering specific smaller support, but I want to make it absolutely clear that it must be transitional and limited to certain products.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on promotion of fruit and vegetables, I fully agree with you that this issue is of huge concern not only to agriculture but also to health and to consumer policies. We produce plenty of high-quality fruit and vegetables in the European Union, but our citizens do not consume enough of them, with growing consequences for their health. I would be in favour of a school fruit scheme to be implemented in line with the position taken by the Commission on 13 May 2007 in the White Paper on a strategy for Europe on nutrition, weight and obesity-related health issues. However, before doing this we would need to carry out the necessary impact assessments of such a measure. I have asked my services to undertake such work immediately.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those are my first comments and I am looking forward to a constructive discussion with the honourable Members of the European Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-257" speaker_id="28361" name="María Isabel Salinas García" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking you, not just for being here, but also for your cooperation and willingness to work with me.</p>
      <p sl="es">The truth is that we are dealing with the reform of a very important sector, which you know very well. It represents 17% of our end agricultural output, but it only receives about 3% of the aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that the sector that we are discussing today is very dynamic. It is also, however, a very fragile sector, with structural problems, exposed to increasing external pressure and the pressure of large-scale distribution.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report that we are debating today and that we will vote on tomorrow is the result of a long period of work. It is an open report, and I believe that this Parliament’s position has always been open with regard to the Commission. We have always sought agreements, but at the same time it is a realistic report.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is complicated, because we are dealing with forty different products for twenty-seven countries. It is no surprise that it received more than 380 amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but it is also the case that there were only two votes against it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Not everything in your proposal, in the Commission's proposal, seems to us to be negative, by any means. It is very important that producer organisations should be seen as the cornerstone of the reform from the outset. The truth is, however, that in Parliament, and in the whole of the European Union's sector, there are certain problems that, in all of the Member States, we have seen as priorities within the reform.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the decoupling of aid for processed products, as the Commissioner has quite rightly pointed out. The second problem is the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in areas eligible for the single payment. And, above all, we in Parliament would stress the lack of a genuine crisis management mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the European Parliament has made a great effort to achieve consensus with a view to reaching agreements on these three issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, we are in favour of maintaining the current marketing rules. It is true that they should be rather simpler, but we are in favour of maintaining those marketing rules.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament has expressed, and will express tomorrow, its opposition to the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in eligible areas. At least until the Commission presents an impact study, as demanded by the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are calling for the strengthening of producer organisations, in the way that has already been mentioned: increasing their funding to 6%. And in cases of the 60% increase in assistance, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, I hope that certain requests will be taken into account, such as integrated production or designations of origin.</p>
      <p sl="es">Where we have achieved a great compromise, because it is very important, because it is a fragile sector, is on the need to create the Security Fund for crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having heard what you have said, I believe that, right now, this is where Parliament’s almost unanimous position differs most from that of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have expressed our support, and we continue to do so, for a crisis Security Fund that is open to all producers – including non-associated producers — and two-thirds funded by the European Union and a third by producer organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also stress the need for a price observatory. Our future in this sector does not lie in subsidies, but in the market. And we must have reliable and up-to-date information on the evolution of the markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, decoupling, I am delighted to hear that there is at last a glimpse of the possibility of a transitional period. There are certain dual-use products, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, which, under the initial proposal, could lead to the abandonment of production.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore firmly advocate a transitional period, and let us hope that it is not as short as has been suggested here this evening, but sufficient for the sector to be able to continue adapting to the single payment scheme.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that that voluntary transitional period can allow for some kind of partial decoupling that could be a transitional measure.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also stress the need to strengthen aid for red fruits. I am also delighted to hear what you have said, because I believe that this is clearly a need that Parliament has indicated and the Commission has considered.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to end by thanking everybody who has helped me during this year of work, the shadow rapporteurs and all of the officials from the European Commission for their contributions, for cooperating with me, the committee secretariat and everybody, because I believe that the report that we will vote on tomorrow, which is the result of a broad consensus, has also been enriched by the contributions of the other groups and of the whole of society.</p>

      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, today, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic sectors of European agriculture, thanks in particular to the efforts of the farmers, the producers, to improve the marketing networks and to increase the quality of their products and concentrate supply.</p>
      <p sl="es">In no way can it be argued that the fruit and vegetable sector relies on aid from Brussels. In fact it succeeds in a very aggressive market, owing to the fact that the people participating in it work hard, and the money they receive represents no more than 1% of the turnover of farms.</p>
      <p sl="es">The great majority of these producers are not currently asking for subsidies or early retirement aid. What they are asking for and demanding are mechanisms for tackling the current problems, which can only get even worse in the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope you will allow me to remind you all that the fruit and vegetable sector is the great bargaining chip in the European Union’s agricultural negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the future, the current pressures in the market will get worse as the existing tariff barriers are dismantled.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to call upon the Member States to draw up appropriate crisis management mechanisms within the context of the reform of the sector that will probably be adopted next week at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur has already said, and as many of you also know and acknowledge, crisis management is a fashionable topic and it will be important in the future for all of the sectors of the common agricultural policy as a result of the dismantling of intervention measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the case of fruit and vegetables, however, this problem also needs to be resolved urgently in view of the strong competition from third-country imports and the pressures resulting from large-scale distribution.</p>
      <p sl="es">An imaginative solution needs to be found to help the sector to deal with the critical times ahead, and this Parliament is offering the solution in the report by Mrs Salinas.</p>
      <p sl="es">This involves a specific fund for serious crises intended for the implementation of certain actions such as pension funds and to which the whole of the sector would have access. This would represent a very positive step, bearing in mind that we are not deviating from what we have done until now, which is co-responsibility for the producer.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that, for the fruit and vegetables sector, this report proposes a pioneering form of crisis management that other sectors will have to copy in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is one of the last to be undertaken. It has still not been covered by the 2003 reform. It is also one of the most significant market reforms in the current Financial Perspective. I should like to congratulate Mrs Salinas García on a very objective report, which covers many issues of importance for both old and new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As my colleague has already dealt with all the points we wished to make in the House, I shall refer only to the soft fruit sector, which is of vital importance for the new Member States. The reform must include effective solutions for this sector, bearing in mind the need to ensure that growing this fruit in the Community will remain profitable and that Community growers can obtain a suitable level of income from it. Soft fruit is a delicate product and should be dealt with in the same way as other Community products considered delicate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is essential to apply different payments to the soft fruit sector beyond the SAPS financial envelope. Such a payment would be directed exclusively to soft fruit producers. Support in the form of separate area payments would lead to restructuring and improve the effectiveness and competitiveness of this sector. It would therefore stabilise the income of soft fruit growers.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur. I admire her for the way she has fought her way through the many amendments that have been tabled. We as the ALDE Group support the result as a whole, and hence the gist of the Commission proposals. Making producer organisations stronger is a good thing. The market of horticultural products is increasingly being dominated by large supermarkets and other trade organisations, and producers must combine forces in order to form a counterweight.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Most of the ALDE Group would beg to differ with the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the already much-debated crisis fund and crisis management in general. We think the Commission proposals are better. For starters, I would not know where the money would come from. Also in the long term, it is impossible to assume that any authority could be responsible for crisis management. The authority will always make a contribution – this has been provided for – but the producers will need to shoulder the lion’s share of the responsibility. If, moreover, we encourage crisis management to be taken care of via the producer organisation, this will also draw in more members, which will at the same time mean that producer organisations will gain more power compared to traders and supermarkets. Our vote will therefore be different from what the Committee on Agriculture proposed in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should once again like to stand up for quality policy. The Commissioner knows that this is a subject that is very close to my heart. After the last conference on this subject, I left in a frame of mind that was anything but optimistic, but I am heartened by the fact that an amendment concerning the need for a quality label for horticultural products, tabled by the ALDE Group, was adopted unanimously in the Agricultural Group by all parties. This is quite unique. With this support from the Committee on Agriculture, the Commissioner may therefore want to reconsider a quality policy for certain agricultural products, because we still believe that this is called for.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am unaware of the latest developments as regards school fruit, but we thought the Commissioner's idea in this respect was endearing.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this reform is justified but it is unfair. The principles laid down five years ago at Copenhagen are unfair to the new Member States. It was established that farmers in the new countries would receive several times less aid than those in the old Union. We agreed to this hoping that we would come to receive equal treatment in due course.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Subsequent reforms of the common agricultural policy have perpetuated the division into more and less favoured countries, however. The reform of the fruit and vegetable market is one example of this. The old Union was receiving hundreds of millions of euro and will continue to do so. The new Union receives token sums. Allow me to pose the following questions: where is the actual aid for soft fruit producers in the new Member States to be found? Why has the Commission not responded to the European Parliament resolution of October 2006?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Much has been said about supporting the European Constitution and the danger that failure to do so will lead to the emergence of a two-speed Europe. In fact, as far as agriculture is concerned we already have a two-class Europe, namely the more favoured old Union that retains the status it created for itself in the past and the less favoured new Union that cannot expect equal treatment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We tabled an amendment that would include cherries and apples for processing in the reform of soft fruit production, accompanied by a EUR 148 million increase in the national envelopes. I call on the House to support this amendment. At the level of the Union as a whole, it does not represent much money. It is a matter of principle, however, not of money. There must be an end to this division into better and worse Member States. We respect the Accession Treaties, but new principles must be introduced, transcending the division into 15 more favoured Member States and 12 less favoured ones. All 27 Member States must enjoy the same rights. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, bringing together members from both old and new Member States, is resolute in its demand for this. We call for a reform that is not only justified but also fair.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn must especially thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur of the report that we are about to examine in this Chamber, but my group is unlikely to vote for it because of two points that I should like to highlight.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first is that this reform, which is so important for a sector that employs thousands, if not millions, of workers in both agriculture and processing, may change the landscape completely once we have directives on climate change. If it is true that Europe is rightly starting to expand alternative forms of production – biodiesel, biofuels, and the production of mass and biomass from wood – then it means that several million hectares will be taken out of agricultural and food production for human and animal consumption. That is already happening in large countries like China: it was in the news a few days ago.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second point is the fact that the reform in question does not address one of the problems raised in this Chamber, which is that in recent years the profit from agricultural production has all gone to commercial businesses and large multinationals. According to some statistics, between 60% and 70% of agricultural profit is kept by the distribution chain.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reform we are examining does not address this problem. Those are the basic reasons that we want to raise, and we are therefore unlikely to vote for the report in this Chamber tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() I would like to praise the efforts of my colleague, Mrs García, in drawing up her report into the proposal for a Council regulation for establishing specific provisions in respect of the fruit and vegetable sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The heated debates within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about this proposal identified certain risks associated with the substance of the proposal and, in particular, risks arising from the philosophy behind this piece of legislation. The most serious risks concern the early practical implementation of some of the regulations and the low level of EU budget participation. At stake is a mere 3.1% of the budget, while the sector accounts for 17% of the EU’s total agricultural output. In marketing terms, lettuce, radishes and small fruits – virtually the entire fruits and vegetables mix – are the most sensitive of agricultural commodities, and ensuring their smooth transfer from the farm to the table is a daunting logistical task. Therefore, the European Commission should not delude itself into thinking that in future it might be able to transfer to farmers the entire responsibility for fruit and vegetable CMO.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another major risk of the proposal under consideration is the fact that it puts the new Member States at a disadvantage. The problem is that the new Member States do not have functioning producer organisations, and it will take several years for them to become fully operational. Fruit and vegetable producers in the EU-15 have over the decades gradually learned to interact with trading systems and have become trading partners of equal standing. One can reasonably expect that if the proposal were implemented in its present form, the output of the new Member States, already massively reduced, would shrink still further. This is why I believe that the outlined risks should be addressed as a matter of priority when amending the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me add my thanks to the rapporteur, for the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector was truly not an easy subject. As the previous speakers have pointed out, fruit and vegetables account for a very large share of our agricultural output. These reforms will enable us to take a major step towards the modernisation of European agriculture in this sector too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particularly in view of the increasingly fierce international competition resulting from globalisation, it must be our prime objective to enhance the competitiveness of European fruit and vegetable growers while safeguarding the availability to consumers of high-quality European produce at reasonable prices. One means of doing this is the creation of producer organisations, which enable growers to market their products more effectively. Measures to promote fruit and vegetable consumption are particularly worthy of support, because they are also beneficial to public health.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Gräßle of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will table an oral amendment tomorrow in which she will ask the Commission not to wait until the scheduled date of 2013 before compiling an initial report on the execution of the title covering producer organisations, the operating fund and the operational programmes. In fact, we want to have that first report by the end of 2010, followed by progress reports at three-yearly intervals. We seek transparency, and we would also like to be sure that support is actually reaching our intended targets. Seven years is too long to wait for that assurance.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore our responsibility to safeguard the future of Europe’s fruit and vegetable growers by creating a safety net with the aid of targeted assistance in order to combine sustainable production with high quality and a healthy environment.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Salinas Garcia, on her exceptional report, and the Commission, which truly has made a serious and brave proposal in the fruit and vegetable sector. I say 'brave proposal', because it is a sector which has a clear structure with the producer organisations and operational programmes and the main issue raised is that of decoupling.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to highlight, both at a personal level and on behalf of our group, the two basic issues which we shall support. Firstly, a stable financial budget and, secondly, a stable timeframe for reform up to 2013. Subversive policies seeking a transitional reform period in fruit and vegetables, which is something which has not happened in any other product, will I am absolutely certain – from the point of view of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – not be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="el">I have just two comments: you know very well, Commissioner, that Mrs Salinas's proposals are not a very far cry from the Council's proposals and I shall come to the specific issue of the crisis management fund, which I would like you to think about much more positively. The crisis management fund does not need additional resources, but it does need to be outside the operational programmes, otherwise there will be total confusion.</p>

      <p sl="lt">It is understood that reform of the common agricultural policy is essential; however, implementation of the reform is being applied to EU Member States with different levels of agricultural subsidies. New Member States, which get almost three times less in payouts than the old Member States, and having significantly worse exit situations, are obliged to reform their agriculture by further worsening the state of it. A general payout scheme is being offered as a proposed solution for reform of the fruit and vegetable market. For the new Member States this will mean even smaller subsidies than there have been to date, and even less chance of competing in the market. The requirement for fruit and vegetable producers to establish producer organisations in order to receive EU subsidies seriously distorts the fruit and vegetable market. Retail networks may dictate their terms and refuse to accept for resale the produce of small producers. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the regulation proposes to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by encouraging their use among certain sectors of the population – young people, school-age children and teenagers. What about the rest of the population?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, some appropriate action has at last been taken with regard to the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector, which is generally perceived to be unfair. Following lengthy discussions, an anti-dumping price for Chinese strawberries was introduced. It was unfortunate that it only applied to such a short period of time though. Next, a minimum price was introduced. Again, it is unfortunate that this price was so low.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are now presented with an opportunity to allocate additional payments to cherries and sweet cherries, and also to soft fruit such as raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants and gooseberries. Without these payments many growers affected by the severe frosts will most certainly be bankrupted. In its Amendment 116 to the regulation the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests aid amounting to EUR 120.77 per hectare. In my view this is too low a figure. It will not deal effectively with the growers' problems. Aid should be increased to EUR 400 per hectare.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Apple orchard owners were affected by the severe frosts too. Their predicament is also a difficult one, and they are hoping for some aid. That is why I urge the House to adopt Amendment 113, which constitutes a response to all those hoping for aid.</p>

      <p sl="el">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job very well done.</p>
      <p sl="el">The fruit and vegetable sector is extremely important for us. However, I should like to highlight certain points:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, in a sector such as the fruit and vegetable sector, which includes the most sensitive agricultural products, financing crisis management is extremely important. If it is to be integrated, it should not be included in the operational programmes and be cofinanced by producers; it should be financed from additional Community resources and be extended to the field of prevention, as I also requested as shadow rapporteur when we debated future support measures for agricultural production eighteen months ago.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, the obligatory inclusion of agri-environmental actions in the operational programmes of producer organisations, as a precondition to their approval, is a positive move. However, setting compulsory expenditure at one-fifth of the budget for the actions is excessive and should be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, we should at some point perhaps turn our attention to small crops, to small-scale producers, such as those growing saffron and mastic in Chios. We must also look at small-scale producers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fourthly, for producer organisations, financing at a rate of 60% in under-organised areas is positive, but capping at 4.1% of the value of the marketed production is marginal and will not allow them to honour the new, important duties they are taking on. On the same subject, we should also refer to the difficulties faced by the Aegean islands, which is why they need to be treated with a certain degree of flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fifthly, information and promotion campaigns aimed at our youth in the European Union are not just to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables; we have a very poor diet and our youth must adopt a healthier diet.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I have the following to say: I should like to point out that we are totally against the oral amendment which may be tabled tomorrow calling for a report to be drafted in 2010 on the operation of the new COM, because this means a different approach to fruit and vegetables, while the other COMs have been regulated quite differently. This is unacceptable under the principles of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">This would be a very good reform if I did not come from one of the new Member States. But this reform is discriminatory in several areas against the new Member States. On the one hand it is discriminatory as regards direct payments. For example, Hungary provides 2% of the Union’s vegetable production, and receives 0.61% of the costs of vegetable production.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The other area of discrimination has to do with processed products. Neither Polish berry fruit, nor sour cherries, nor the products of the new Member States have been included among the produce that is to be processed. And now these monies will be distributed on a historical basis, and it will be primarily three of the old Member States who will receive 800 million of the 1.4 billion. This is a very great injustice toward the new Member States, and I ask that it be rectified.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Salinas García's report is very significant for the agricultural production sector. Unfortunately, however, it does not apply equal terms to producers in the old and new Member States. Supporting farmers by way of direct payments is particularly important for countries where the structure of agriculture is fragmented, with small holdings and monoculture, and where the income barely suffices to sustain farming activities. These holdings operate in a traditional and environmentally-friendly manner. The amended regulation should even out the opportunities for payments to farmers in the old and new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is hard to anticipate the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable production. Products of this nature can easily be damaged, prices fluctuate and there is competition from third countries. Climate change and increasingly frequent natural disasters also impact on effectiveness. By way of example I could refer to the spring frosts in Poland which affected 70% of currant, plum, pear and sweet cherry blossom. Polish fruit growers and market gardeners estimate that this year's losses will amount to 60%. Amendments 6, 7 and 12 to the regulation concerning Recitals 11, 13 and 18 and also Amendment 113 are particularly worthy of support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today's debate on the report concerning reform of the fruit and vegetable market and tomorrow's vote on the matter bring to an end several months of work within the European Parliament. I believe that during this period we have succeeded in raising awareness of the problems affecting the Polish soft fruit market and convincing most Members of the House of the need to introduce appropriate support mechanisms. Such mechanisms would serve to restructure the sector and improve its competitiveness. Two features of this sector in the new Member States are the fragmentation of production and the fact that there are no strong groups or associations of producers. In addition, the sector is particularly vulnerable at times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The existing support instruments and those proposed in the draft reform of the COM of fruit and vegetables do not provide sufficient aid and do not offer effective solutions to the problems arising in those markets. We are therefore requesting special payments for growers of soft fruit and cherries intended for processing, so as to improve incomes and stabilise the fruit and vegetable market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I urge the Commissioner to study Amendment 132, which I tabled jointly with Mrs Herranz García on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I also ask for support for Amendment 122, on aid for the market of tomatoes for processing in the new Member States under the SAPS system. Adoption of this amendment would ensure that tomato producers in those countries retained the aid they are currently receiving.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, there are two issues Polish soft fruit growers cannot understand. The first is why they have to wait so long for relevant proposals. The second is why the Commission cannot even come up with a few tens of millions euro to support the soft fruit sector, when it has an annual budget in excess of EUR 1.5 billion. Strawberries, raspberries and currants are just as important for Polish farmers as oranges, mandarins and figs are for their opposite numbers in southern Europe. Commissioner, we earnestly hope that at the forthcoming Council of Agriculture Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union you will propose appropriate support for this group of farmers. I trust the negotiations will prove fruitful.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I particularly welcome Parliament’s recommendations on crisis management and on strengthening producer organisations.

      <p sl="pt">Your speech at the start of this debate, Commissioner, made me fear that the aspect of Parliament’s political support for the proposals has not been correctly interpreted, but I trust that common sense and a spirit of compromise will ultimately prevail in the Council and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the fruit and vegetable sector is very important for the agriculture of the Union in general and of countries like Poland in particular. Unfortunately, the proposed solutions are not beneficial for us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, as part of the significant changes to be introduced in this sector, it is proposed that the existing support for the old Member State be maintained, but the new ones are to be treated as if they were not actually Members, but still mere applicants. Supporting the national envelopes of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain with sums of between EUR 316 million and EUR 167 million, whilst Poland's envelope is to be increased by barely EUR 6.7 million even though it has a large fruit and vegetable sector must surely run counter to the principle of European solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, there is no tradition of producers' groups in the new Member States. This is bound to mean that a sum of almost EUR 700 million a year will go mainly to producers' groups and associations in the old Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, the reform fails to deal with the issue of the Union's market becoming increasingly open to imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries. The European Union has an annual trade deficit in excess of EUR 8 billion in this sector. These imports are often sold at dumping prices, which is detrimental to the production of fruit and vegetables within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">From my point of view there are still some outstanding issues to be clarified. We must be able to ensure that the impact within different regions in Member States is not too harsh. The mechanism of this proposal is complicated for those regions that applied the hybrid area-based model for the single farm payment, including my own area, and this, in particular, must be resolved. This is a difficult, complex area that must be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many different outside pressures that impinge on the marketing process. High among those is the purchasing power of the large supermarket chains, where one supplier or producer is put against another to drive the price down. There are also those who import cheap produce, turn it around and add value to produce of unknown origin. We seem to be unable to stop this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am now going to be rather parochial. Last week I led a delegation to my local minister in Northern Ireland to raise the plight of mushroom growers in that area. Four years ago in Northern Ireland we had over 226 mushroom growers, today we have 40 – an 80% drop in those involved in the industry. I have to ask whether anyone cares, and I have come to the conclusion that the answer is no. Farming families have been destroyed and their incomes done away with. They have been totally disregarded by those capable of importing cheap mushrooms, adding value and selling them to the supermarkets, which pretend that they are local.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we stand back and allow such a situation to continue in this and other areas, we will totally destroy the fabric of rural society as we know it. These commodities keep families and communities together. We destroy them at our peril; we must defend rural society.</p>

My colleague Mr Nicholson has not exactly stolen my thunder, but I want to repeat some of his thunder, and the Commissioner will know that I am like a long playing record. I support the idea of producer groups but I am not at all convinced that we will ever have the matching power of the retail sector. I have said it before and I repeat it now that the Commission is unwilling to take on the elephant in the room, i.e. the very powerful retail sector in Europe which is particularly powerful in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">After you launched your debate on this particular subject we had farmers in Ireland on television declaring that they would no longer grow fruit and vegetables because there was no profit to be made in it because they could not get the prices they needed. However, let us see what happens from this reform. I hope that this report which we propose for 2010 will look at the impact in terms of the balance of power, which currently lies in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea of consumption and health is a very positive one but I think every time we tell the European public that it is healthy to eat fruit and vegetables they seem to eat less of them, so we need to think of a different message. I like the idea of school fruit schemes and I would ask that your impact assessment take into account the many pilot projects. There is one in particular in Ireland that works and you probably have details of it, but good luck with it and I hope it works for the fruit and vegetable producers of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to make a few comments because I am sure that some Members of this Parliament did not listen to my first speech, when I talked about the soft fruit sector. I made it clear that I am aware of the difficulties in the soft fruit sector within the European Union. I am ready to take into account the sensitivity of the sector and to try to find money within the budget to support this sector for a transitional period. But do not expect the figures that you mentioned. I think you said EUR 800. This cannot be achieved within the budget. However, I have clearly said that I will do my very best to find a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the anti-dumping measures taken in April have clearly been a step in the right direction. Problems faced due to frost will be handled separately. It is possible to deal with specific situations involving climatic catastrophes within the state aid rules, so we will try to handle this issue separately.</p>
      <p sl="en">A question was raised on funding. In my opinion, trying to create a fund outside the producer organisations is not really simplification. As you know, simplification is very high on the Commission's agenda. It will be a very complex instrument and we have to take into account the fact that we have to act within an annual budget. We could lose quite a lot of money on the fund's construction because it is multi-annual, but I am sure that we will find a decent solution and a crisis management tool that can work efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that it will be possible to achieve a political agreement at the Council meeting next Monday and Tuesday. I am quite sure that we will manage to find a political agreement that will benefit the whole fruit and vegetable sector within the European Union, so that it will have a sustainable future, which, I presume, is what we all want.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is now three years since the new Member States acceded to the European Union, but they are still being discriminated against in terms of budget appropriations for the fruit and vegetable market. This is clear from the size of the payments allocated per hectare of land devoted to growing fruit and vegetables. In 2005, the old Member States (EU-15) received EUR 561 per hectare, whilst the new ones (EU-10) only received EUR 20 per hectare. The poorer countries therefore receive 28 times less support than the richer ones.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no reason for such discrimination. The new Member States have introduced many important and specific products into the Union. At the same time they experienced and are continuing to experience problems regarding the profitability of these types of products. Amongst other reasons, the problems are due to cheap imports from third countries and the fragmentation of production. The new countries therefore had good reason to expect that their difficulties would be recognised and that they would be able to benefit from the same wide range of support as the old Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission has conducted missions and undertaken a series of consultations and studies. Nonetheless, the Commission's proposal for reform of the market still discriminates against the new Member States. The Commission has also disregarded Parliament. In its resolution of 11 May 2005 this House called for Union support for soft fruit, cherries, sweet cherries and apples intended for processing to be provided at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Discriminatory action against the new Member States on the fruit and vegetable market is detrimental not only to growers in the new Member States, but also to the Union as a whole and to its consumers.</p>
