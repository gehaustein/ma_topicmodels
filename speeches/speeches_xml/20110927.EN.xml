      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Elisabetta Gardini, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on ‘Towards a stronger European disaster response: role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance’ (Α7-0283/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-008-000" speaker_id="58758" name="Elisabetta Gardini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I really must thank everyone who, over recent weeks and months, has helped to produce the document on which we are voting in this Chamber today.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have to say we worked very well and a really constructive debate was developed. The motion for a resolution that we are voting on today is the outcome of a truly joint effort, with contributions from all the political groups and from Parliament as a whole. I believe everyone has come to share very strong feelings on this subject, not least because we have to remember that we are living in a period marked by an exponential increase in disasters.</p>
      <p sl="it">The figures in all their starkness speak for themselves: the number of disasters in the world has risen fivefold; just think that 78 catastrophic events were recorded in 1975, whereas today, we have nearly 400 disasters every year. Over the past 20 years, disasters have sadly killed 90 000 people and affected more than 29 million, while economic losses have amounted to EUR 211 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are clearly facing problems on such a scale that they require a more vigorous and effective response and a really strong commitment on our part. We all have images in our minds of the earthquake in Haiti, the floods in Pakistan and what happened in Japan. Europe itself witnesses flash floods and forest fires within its territory every year, and we all remember the ash cloud after the volcanic eruption in Iceland.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no need to go any further to demonstrate the importance of the work being done here in Parliament, based on two fundamental principles which are our guiding stars: the principle of solidarity, which is reinforced by the solidarity clause in the Treaty of Lisbon, and the principle of subsidiarity. We are working along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="it">Past interventions by the European Union have always been generous and effective – I think the tireless work done by Commissioner Georgieva bears witness to that – but today, we need to make a qualitative leap. We must be prepared to make a qualitative leap from ad hoc responses to responses that are enhanced through the prior identification of the assets available in the Member States that can be placed at the disposal of the European Civil Protection Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, it is also important to emphasise the crucial role that services such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES) can play in this qualitative leap and in moving on from information sharing and emergency response to the planning, monitoring and coordination role that we want. I also take this opportunity to mention the concern that exists at what is happening to the budget for these essential new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have included the importance of communicating with the public, because the Japanese experience has clearly taught us that one can never do this enough. We are also asking the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal on civil protection as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-009-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Kristalina Georgieva" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very grateful for the debate today and very grateful to Mrs Gardini for leading the preparation of the report. As she so clearly stated, we live in a world where the frequency and intensity of disasters is on the increase, and climate change, population growth and urbanisation, as well as terrorism, put us at a higher risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have witnessed over the years the role that Parliament has played in creating a high level of ambition to make solidarity work for European citizens and for the citizens of the world. I would quote the initiatives taken on the EU Forest Fire Tactical Reserve, on creating multi-country pilot modules like the BaltFloodCombat module, as well as on bringing transportation capacity to bear. We saw how much it helped us during the Libya crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against that background of growing needs, the Commission has taken its responsibility very seriously, and has put forward the communication that is now to be turned into a legislative proposal, for which I very much count on Parliament’s help.</p>
      <p sl="en">That communication is based on four very important principles. The first is to respect the primary role of Member States in securing the safety of their citizens. Therefore, what we have put forward is a ‘bottom-up’ approach where we bring the assets of Member States together for collective action when either a Member State or a third country is overwhelmed by a disaster.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we recognise that we must be better in anticipating risks so that we can act decisively when they materialise. Therefore, we raise the role of the Commission in bringing Member States into scenario plannings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, there is a very important move away from the ad hoc response we currently have to one that is pre-planned, pre-arranged and predictable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, we are very mindful of the tough budgetary times in Europe, so we are looking at ways in which working together will create savings for Member States. In this sense, the proposal which we have designed is a very modest increase, at the level of the Commission, from EUR 25 million to EUR 65 million, but generates on that basis not only high impact but also savings for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish with one very crucial point. We are doing this for our citizens, and over 90% of them want us to act together in the face of disasters. We owe it to them to do exactly that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the proliferation of major natural disasters and current budgetary pressure, the European Union must substantially strengthen its disaster response capacity and make optimum use of its limited resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following numerous calls from our House, the European Commission should clearly draw up ambitious legislative proposals as quickly as possible, but not later than by the end of 2011, to create at last a genuine EU civil protection force. This would entail some Member States committing to make pre-identified and immediately deployable civil protection assets available on a voluntary basis for EU disaster relief interventions in the event of major disasters. I welcome the recent communication from the Commission on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 which has a budget of EUR 455 million for the Civil Protection Mechanism and which attaches great importance to disaster preparedness and prevention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the Commission must make active efforts to ensure the visibility of the resources and capacities deployed in the field, particularly through the use of EU symbols in conjunction with national badges.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done and to express my satisfaction, both at the particular emphasis placed on forest fire prevention and management and at the fact that the main positions expressed in the Committee on Regional Development have been incorporated into the final text.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Committee on Regional Development mainly wishes to emphasise the fact that the solidarity clause introduced in Article 222 of the Treaty of Lisbon can, and must, provide an important basis for further reinforcement and support, on the part of the European Union, of action by the Member States in the civil protection sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">Moreover, we reiterate the role and the responsibility of regional and local authorities, the important role of the European Regional Development Fund, and the need to utilise the valuable experience gained at regional level under INTERREG programmes and, finally, that coastal, insular and mountainous areas are extremely vulnerable to disaster on account of their geography.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to ask the Commissioner to comment on point 7 of the report on the establishment of an EU civil protection force.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur. She has done the right thing and kept the own-initiative report to a minimum, addressing only the essential issues that Parliament wants to include in the legislative proposal that the Commission will propose this autumn. It would not have been right to inflate the report. Instead, we must now debate just the basic principles.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear to all of us that this could affect any Member State. A natural disaster or technical disaster could descend upon it, causing a great deal of human suffering and enormous economic damage. The scale of the damage has, of course, been mentioned many times. In recent years, we have noticed that this damage is increasing considerably and the degree of interconnectivity and complexity of our societies is increasing. A logical consequence of this is that greater action needs to be taken by Europe. In its proposal, therefore, the Commission ought to take into consideration – as the Commissioner has already mentioned – the fact that, first and foremost, the Member States must retain their responsibility – thus, a bottom-up approach – but that Europe must play a very strong coordinating role.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection, I also have a question for you, Commissioner. It is your quintessential responsibility that we are discussing here, is it not? Nevertheless, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is calling for the High Representative to take a very strong role here. I am concerned that, with the disputes over competence in the Commission, we will not know who is actually responsible. This ought to be clarified right at the start in order to avoid duplication of work.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we concentrate resources, plan in advance and improve our preparation so that we really are able to act quickly. I was actually rapporteur for the Floods Directive and, in this regard, we also saw that if we are well prepared, we can save lives and also prevent economic damage. I hope, Commissioner, that you will table a proposal along these lines as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, we, too, welcome your communication on improving civil protection in the European Union. Citizens in Europe expect us to respond quickly and efficiently in the event of a disaster and, above all, to help each other. In the past, we have sometimes sat helpless in front of the television watching forest fires in southern Europe and asked ourselves: why are the others not helping? Your communication now represents the next step towards European solidarity and the efficient use of the capacities that we have in Europe. We have everything that we need. We really do have all of the facilities we need to deal with disasters in Europe. In that respect, this is a positive step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a previous speaker said, national capacities should not be replaced by centralisation at EU level, but we do need to exploit synergies. We really do need everyone to act swiftly together. This is also urgently needed now. I also agree that we need to think more and more in terms of prevention. We need to deal in the right way with the information that we have and must not wait until a disaster has occurred. We can do a great deal with regard to flooding or potential droughts, where fires frequently break out. I am pleased that we will now organise civil protection, both in the EU and also outside the EU, in a coherent way. I agree with Mr Seeber: the areas of responsibility ought to be clear. You are responsible. You ought to accept that responsibility and not permit the areas of responsibility to be mixed up so that we no longer know who is responsible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I believe that this 24/7 preparedness must always be ensured, including at Christmas, during New Year, on public holidays, and during the summer, too. That is very important. I would like to thank Ms Gardini for her excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased, and first of all, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful collaboration on such a highly topical and extremely important dossier as this.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I was saying, we are pleased with the balanced, rational approach adopted in the report, which perfectly takes account of the principle of subsidiarity and the idea of a solidarity clause, which should guide the Member States’ actions in their response to disasters and in their civil protection role. Specifically, I believe it is necessary to develop a predictable, pre-planned system within the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism that is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In other words, it must not involve setting up a supranational body, which would be liable to duplicate costs and powers without any assurance that it would work efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="it">I particularly welcome the attention devoted to extremely vulnerable areas such as islands, which is clearly expressed throughout the body of the report, as well as the emphasis on the link between disaster preparation, prevention and response, which make up an inseparable trio. Lastly, I am pleased to see how sensitively other Members have addressed the subject of major regional threats, which I believe deserves our attention; in particular, there have been many references to actions and strategies targeting forest fires.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am pleased that we are doing something about this matter, since the number of natural disasters has increased around the world by 500%. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that this problem applies not only to Pakistan or Haiti, but also to Europe, and to Europeans who lose their lives in natural disasters or who sustain significant material losses. This initiative on the part of the European institutions is much needed, as, to be frank, individual countries are not always able to cope with the problem. This is the case in my country, Poland, where the government let down the victims of the latest series of natural disasters, which included hurricanes – both the victims who lost their homes and those whose businesses were affected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, this initiative at European Union level is unquestionably necessary. Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about genuine assistance, since what the victims expect is not a physical display of European Union symbols in places where help is needed, as we have heard, but real support. Such assistance will serve as the best way of promoting the European institutions. It is very important that we are not only talking about post-disaster aid, but also about prevention and averting disasters such as forest fires or, as is significant in the case of my homeland, flood prevention.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I wish to welcome Elisabetta Gardini’s report, and I thank Ms Gardini for her hard work. I thank her especially for her cooperation with us as she took our recommendations and amendments into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Disaster reduction is an important part of sustainable development. If we plan our development in a way that reduces the risk of disaster, we can save a large number of lives. We can reduce social, economic and environmental destruction as a result of natural hazards, and along with that we can gradually reduce the destruction connected to technological and environmental disaster.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Disaster response begins with prevention and preparedness. I urge the European Commission and the Member States to invest more in disaster reduction and to improve disaster response efficiency in a spirit of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Clarity, consistency and coherence are the principal columns on which a strong, working European disaster response system is built.</p>
      <p sl="ga">It is important that there is proper coordination so that we can provide efficient humanitarian aid. However, important humanitarian principles must also be observed, including impartiality, neutrality and independence. We must ensure that international humanitarian law is implemented.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We must ensure that political and strategic affairs do not affect decisions in relation to the distribution of aid. We must ensure that disaster relief is never governed by the strategic trade or political interests of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We should provide the EU’s humanitarian aid regardless of any political consideration and, at the same time, adhere to agreed international humanitarian principles.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to join in thanking Ms Gardini for doing such an excellent job.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we all know, of course, the best thing would be to prevent natural and man-made disasters, but it is not always possible. In any case, when they occur, we need to be ready to intervene as effectively and as swiftly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Treaty of Lisbon allows the European Union to act in matters of civil protection as well, and therefore, in the event of a disaster, we need to be able to set up emergency response centres that are operational 24/7. We need to avoid overlapping and duplication of efforts on both the political and the operational side, and it is therefore important to stress that all Member States need to contribute to this project in the spirit of European solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">There must be no barriers when people are in need, but it is essential to intervene rapidly and as efficiently as possible. Of course, it would also do no harm if we managed to keep costs down at times of crisis.</p>

    <intervention id="2-018-000" speaker_id="96981" name="Franz Obermayr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, it will be important to increase the efficiency of our disaster response in the EU. We need to learn from the experience of the most recent disasters and abandon particularly risky technologies such as nuclear power or deep-sea drilling. In addition, directives relating to potential risks must be properly transposed. That did not happen, for example, in the case of the sludge spill in Kolontár in Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="de">A permanent EU civil protection force is something that I think is appropriate to a limited extent only. In some areas, it is indeed appropriate, for example, shared aircraft for fighting fires, but I am essentially of the opinion that the principle that people should help themselves absolutely must be adhered to. In this regard, we absolutely must ensure that we have a risk prevention system in place in the Member States. In countries like Austria or Germany, or in South Tyrol in particular, this disaster prevention is exemplary and it is provided by voluntary components. This should also be upheld as an example in the EU. I say this as someone who has been a member of a voluntary fire service since the age of 14.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and all my colleagues who helped to draft this consensus report, a report which underlines both the need to upgrade European disaster response mechanisms, by improving the utilisation of resources, and to safeguard the European solidarity sorely needed at this juncture.</p>
      <p sl="el">With more and more frequent and increasingly serious, natural and man-made disasters, there is an increased need for greater efficiency at all levels of European disaster management, including prevention, response readiness and restoration.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to focus on the prevention aspect: we could save time and money by investing more in prevention than in response and restoration. The faster pace of climate change and of the rate at which natural resources are being depleted will further increase the probability of more frequent and more serious natural disasters. Action to combat climate change and rationally manage natural resources is a smart preventative investment that will save not only human lives, but also valuable resources at this time of economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within this framework, our amendments, which were adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, stressed precisely this conclusion and the need for more effective emergency response planning for oil spills and nuclear and other dangerous materials. They also underline the need for the ‘polluter pays’ principle to be applied more effectively in terms of responsibility for environmental damage. The accidents in the Gulf of Mexico and Fukushima must remain forever in our minds.</p>

    <intervention id="2-020-000" speaker_id="1930" name="Horst Schnellhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, who has produced a very concise and clear report that also consolidates our tasks. If you read the report and see that there are 16 references to the legal bases underpinning our work to date in disaster prevention and in the area of humanitarian aid, you would have to assume that that would be sufficient. The most recent disaster response results have also shown that we have responded well. However, we also have a new situation in Europe. We are experiencing more environmental disasters and we have terrorist attacks that require rapid responses. I therefore think that it is right for the Commission to table a legislative proposal in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there is one thing that we need to bear in mind, and it has been said many times already, and that is that the Member States must be at the centre of this. However, if we want to set up a disaster response unit, then, Commissioner, it can only be created from the resources of the Member States. When it comes to coordination, however – the important point is that you know where the units are, what they can do, and then coordinate this – the Commission is very well placed to do that and that should be our starting point. Although the financial resources have been increased, I think it is much more important to increase efficiency. That is necessary, and that is why we can actually do without financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have another couple of comments regarding the disaster relief fund. There have been calls once again here for this to be extended. I am opposed to this, because we will then have so many variations and options for where the disaster relief fund should be deployed. We ought to leave it as it is. It is there to enable us to reduce the impact of unforeseen disasters, and that is the way it should stay.</p>

    <intervention id="2-021-000" speaker_id="28310" name="Edite Estrela" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, disasters are a recurring theme in our debates in Parliament, which is only natural given that they are becoming more frequent and devastating. I should therefore like to welcome Commissioner Georgieva’s initiative, because it seems very relevant to me, and to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Gardini. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament agree with the analysis of the effects of climate change on the increasing number and seriousness of disasters, and would prioritise prevention policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon introduces provisions enabling us to strengthen our response to disasters, and to make it more comprehensive, coordinated and efficient. We therefore welcome the proposal to establish a European emergency response capacity, as well as the proposal to develop a European emergency response centre.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The objective of maintaining a permanent 24/7 operational centre working in conjunction with the Member States through focal points that are also permanent also seems to be of the greatest importance to us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to welcome the rapporteur’s proposals, notably as regards pilot projects. For example, I would stress the importance of the pilot project concerning a tactical reserve for aerial fire-fighting to combat forest fires, whose success justifies its continuation and consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon also introduced a solidarity clause, and I believe solidarity is an aspect of disaster response that had to be stressed in this report. As such, that is indeed why we tabled amendments to reinforce the solidarity aspect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we know that if a catastrophe is well handled with a good reaction capacity, many lives can be saved and colossal damage can be avoided. Nevertheless, prevention is the best solution of all. In particular, with regard to man-made disasters such as Fukushima or the oil spill in Mexico, we have to enhance the benefits of ensuring our safety by anticipation. Paying particular attention to climate change and developing a greener economy will surely be a way to reduce considerably both man-made and natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank our rapporteur for the work done on a very important, but also an extremely complex, issue. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to find a common guideline to these phenomena, which are all different and which all need a very prompt and accurate reaction.</p>

So as I say, I rise with some humility. However, I look forward with the great British sense of humour which is one thing nobody can take away from us in this place which gave us an energy policy, an employment policy, a fisheries policy, an agricultural policy that have been – as almost everything that this place has done has been – a complete and total disaster. We are now contemplating a response to disasters, most of which of course we create for ourselves in this place. So I can say I look forward to seeing how this develops, how it goes forward in the future, and I am just interested to see what kind of pig’s breakfast you are going to make of this one!</p>

    <intervention id="2-024-000" speaker_id="2025" name="Françoise Grossetête" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Ms Gardini explained quite clearly in her preamble that this is about solidarity, subsidiarity and, I would add, effectiveness. It is true, as has been said, that the frequency of disasters in the European Union is on the increase, which is why it is important to be able to unite our efforts or, in other words, pool them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, this idea is entirely based on Michel Barnier’s excellent report of 2006, in which he called for the European Union to allow a number of the resources at its disposal to be pooled, so as to create a sort of European civil protection force that would enable these resources to be brought together and to provide a quicker and more effective response. This would allow us to make use of our most sophisticated technology. We have both the Galileo and the GMES programmes and we also have telecommunications, which enable us to access critical information quickly and, hence, always respond as promptly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to telecommunications, I should like to take this opportunity to remind people of the benefit of the European emergency number that we sought to create, 112, which has the power to save the lives of thousands of Europeans every day. It is crucial that this number be communicated more effectively to our fellow citizens so that they can be aware of the resources which are available to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report by Ms Gardini therefore proves we can make a radical difference without overhauling existing structures, but rather by pooling resources, paying careful attention, of course, that subsidiarity is respected, and that this can be done without creating inadequate and costly structures. We are calling for the European Commission to ensure the proper coordination of those resources. Commissioner, you said that you were expecting Parliament’s support on this and you can count on us to have it.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, firstly, I wish to congratulate my colleagues who worked so hard on this report. This report appears, from what my colleagues have said, to be a broad consensus report. My congratulations therefore to the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and to Mr Stavrakakis from the Committee on Regional Development. This is the second report being put to the vote here in the European Parliament; it comes shortly after the report on forest protection, which calls on us to take measures to protect European forests.</p>
      <p sl="el">European forests, which are necessary if we are to combat climate change, are also necessary if we are to adapt to and to prepare our communities to combat climate change. With the planet overheating, forests are at risk of fire, flood and numerous other disaster scenarios, just as the whole of Europe is at risk of such disasters, the cross-border consequences of which are such that we have no choice but to take action.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission must act accordingly and we await its response as to whether or not it will proceed with the White Paper on forest protection and we shall finally have legislation to adapt our forests to climate change. In this report, Parliament is, for the second time, calling for legislation to prevent forest fires, a measure which will help save resources and which is necessary at this economic juncture. When fires and other disasters occur, we need a flexible solidarity mechanism adapted to local requirements which will provide a common European response.</p>

    <intervention id="2-026-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles Goerens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, there are only a few ways of improving the EU’s disaster response capacity. Prevention, coordination and mutualisation are the key policy words in this area. That means prevention though a policy with a greater focus on sustainable development, coordination and a constant exchange of information to avoid duplication, and the pooling of the resources available in EU Member States, in the interest of efficiency, on the one hand, and proper management of public funds, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Could Commissioner Georgieva tell me what main obstacles could still oppose the integration of these principles into EU policy? Could you, Ms Georgieva, tell us what main difficulties you are still encountering at Member-State level when it comes to compliance with these principles or the achievement of objectives which, incidentally, Member States are requested to meet by the Treaty of Lisbon?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I think that Ms Gardini’s report is very good and a great effort has been made. However, I would have liked it to have looked not only at prevention, but also at what will happen next.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of the extremely serious problems in Haiti, for example, in Lorca during the recent earthquake, and in L’Aquila, is precisely that, while lives have been saved and life has returned to normal, there is a need to rebuild cities, cities that took years and thousands of years to be built. They have to be rebuilt all of a sudden. They have to be built, and there is a science and technology to help with this.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not possible to build on just any ground after an earthquake. It is important to find out which ground is the most suitable. Where is the special European Union unit to coordinate all the knowledge within all the sections? We are told that the new cities must be energy efficient, that they have to be smart cities, but how does one make the transition from a destroyed city to a smart city?</p>
      <p sl="es">In this area, Europe has abandoned its people. It has not put in place any coordination measures, and there is a need, Commissioner, to coordinate the reconstruction work and ensure true flood prevention. There is a need to look at how to control the rivers. Other countries, such as Spain, have achieved this to a large degree.</p>
      <p sl="es">One cannot stop talking about a disaster the day after it has happened. This is why I am much more concerned about what happens next, and I believe that this is where Europe must start to act.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, on behalf of our group, I would like to thank Ms Gardini, who has drawn up a very comprehensive report containing all the salient points.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The establishment of a European emergency response capacity will help EU citizens to feel more secure. It will also play a major role internationally, from the perspective of rescue and humanitarian operations in countries which may be affected by disasters in the future. The proposal to establish a European emergency response capacity is crucially important. I do hope, however, that Member States will maintain full autonomy in managing relief resources and retain the right to use these resources at any time, and I also trust that such resources will be made available on a voluntary basis in keeping with the spirit of European solidarity. It is vital to create a 24/7 European emergency response centre, and given that many already exist in other countries, we can draw on the experience of such centres. These centres will coordinate international operations with our existing practices. It is also essential to draw up scenarios for particular types of disaster, both within and outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is essential to use the emergency response centre to improve the flow of information between the EU and other countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, as everyone has said, in recent years, the European Union has been struck by unprecedented disasters and to name them would take up the entire debate time. I do, however, wish to mention the AZF explosion whose ten-year anniversary we commemorated less than a week ago in Toulouse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Establishing a stronger response at European level, as proposed in Ms Gardini’s report, would be a real opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity between our people. The Union has already been attempting to operationalise this pooling of our efforts for several years and it is now time to act together and stop waiting for a new disaster to strike the EU in order to learn lessons from it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now a question of making our material, human and financial capacities available to each other, in order to prevent new tragedies from occurring. Commissioner Georgieva, just now, you said that it was necessary to anticipate risks. It is extremely regrettable in this regard, that the European Commission intends to withdraw its funding of the earth observation programme GMES, which is recognised by all as an essential instrument in the prevention and coordination of disaster responses. I urge the Commission to reconsider this position and to support flagship programmes which generate undeniable added-value for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, we need more than that. We need a legislative resolution that can go a step further and organise civil protection across Europe with no more gaps and no more overlaps. At a time when the role of the European Union is being debated, this is an area in which there is a demand for more Europe in order to develop united, coordinated action by the whole EU, particularly because civil protection depends on solidarity and volunteering. That fits in nicely with the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon and the current European Year of Volunteering.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Union’s Solidarity Fund operates well on the whole, but based on the experience acquired during the early years of its implementation, it is clear that there are still major constraints and weaknesses in the fund’s operation. These are linked to the fund’s lack of speed in providing funding, to the level of transparency of the criteria for mobilising the fund in the event of regional disasters, as well as to the restrictions to natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must remind you that several Member States received financial support from the European Union for the projects implemented in the areas affected by various disasters. However, the funds were released late in relation to the time when maximum effectiveness would have been achieved. With this in mind, I think that the possibility of assistance being granted in the form of an advance payment scheme, based on an initial estimate of the losses, to a country affected by a disaster, at its request, would be a facility greatly appreciated by the affected areas, immediately after a disaster has occurred.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, exactly one year ago, in September 2010, a report on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by a large majority in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It stated that prevention, as the first and decisive stage in the disaster management cycle, should be ascribed more importance. Through prevention, the occurrence of many disasters could be avoided, whilst the effects of others could be significantly reduced.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Examples of the measures we proposed in that report include the creation of an appropriate financial framework for prevention; actions in the area of forest management and fire prevention, the protection and defence of coastlines, and the restoration and protection of river basins; the creation of an agricultural public insurance scheme and the establishment of a minimum compensation scheme for disaster-affected farmers; the enhancement of early warning systems; and the revision of the Solidarity Fund Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One year on, it is easy to see that almost all this remains to be done. It would be worth bearing that in mind when the other stages of the disaster management cycle – preparation, response and recovery – are being debated.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, there is a saying in my country that misfortune walks not over mountains, but over people. Earthquakes, major floods, fires and other disasters do not sidestep European countries, and the rescue teams of the states affected are often unable, especially in the initial phases of disasters, to provide the necessary assistance in major disasters, and international assistance often becomes a necessity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must therefore welcome the Commission’s decision to merge the monitoring and information centre with the Echo crisis centre, creating one independent centre for emergency responses operating on a continuous basis and which is ready at any time to coordinate the EU's emergency humanitarian aid operations. The development of this institution as a focal point for the rapid coordination of European material and financial aid would underline the good sense of the institution even more. I firmly believe that we can effectively protect the lives and health of our people in emergency situations through well-prepared mechanisms and crisis and humanitarian assistance teams.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Union and its citizens are faced with an alarming rise in the number of disasters and in their level of severity. The disasters which have occurred in every state across the world prove the need to create a strong European rapid response force for dealing with emergencies. The events which cause disasters cannot be avoided. However, they can be managed and their impact mitigated. A series of measures and actions turned into policies aimed at disaster impact prevention are needed to reduce the risk associated with natural phenomena.</p>
      <p sl="ro">More than EUR 2 billion has been provided in financial aid by the Solidarity Fund between 2002 and 2010, confirming the key role played by the EU in supporting disaster-stricken countries. However, it is difficult for the money allocated to reach the people affected. What is needed is to create an efficient mechanism for mobilising immediately the sums allocated from the Solidarity Fund, with a corresponding mechanism being available in each Member State which is equally rapid. I would like to thank and congratulate Ms Gardini.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the multiplication of natural disasters and human-produced disasters is a fact. At the same time, there is more and more strain on the national means available for response, not least because the rest of the world expects the EU to respond to their disasters, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until now, that response has been ad hoc and too bureaucratic. Therefore, a complete overhaul of the entire system is indispensable, and this very detailed report provides the necessary orientation. In essence, we have to eliminate redundancies and increase the efficiency of what we want to keep. In that respect, we need to shift the emphasis from reaction to prevention, stressing monitoring, scenario preparation and education. We need to create a permanent pool of the national means placed at our disposal for such purposes and increase the flexibility of our procedures to make the entire system more operative.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main conditionality would be subsidiarity, then availability of means – both material and financial. Finally, let us not forget that civil protection is entirely in line with the EU philosophy of intervention, and let us stress the civilian element over the military which, even if not entirely eliminated, will not be central.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to refer to two points. Regarding the consolidation of 112 as the single emergency number in Europe, I would ask the Commission to carry out an active check, given that my country, for example, is moving towards further fragmentation of emergency numbers and the services that answer emergency calls. There are even two numbers for fires. Secondly, we should increase the part played by new technologies in the field of early warning and warning systems, for example, by supporting the roll-out of prototypes that the EU finances but which are not then taken up by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, in terms of the organisation of civil protection, I think it is also important to highlight the social changes that have occurred in the European population, which, to an increasing extent, is elderly, of foreign origin and concentrated in outlying areas where there is little infrastructure. Hence, there is a need to safeguard access and the possibility for this most vulnerable section of the population to be supported.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you very much for the excellent comments and suggestions for the legislative proposal. I shall try to group my answers, starting with what this proposal would do in bringing together a true European capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam Striffler brought up this question first. We also had a question from Madam Grossetête on how this relates to the Barnier report. What we are proposing is to integrate the capabilities of Member States and, in this sense, it is more lexis than substance: where the Barnier report was leading us on to and where we are going to be. In the Barnier report, from which we have adopted a total of 12 proposals, the idea is to integrate the capabilities of Member States but there the approach was more top-down, whereas what we are coming with is bottom-up. I can say with confidence that we have support from Member States for this proposal, especially from Member States where the national requirements are such that the delegation is not even at the level of federal or central government but goes down to regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we will have an integrated capacity, we can call it a force, of Member States’ assets. I want to stress that we are not waiting for the legislative proposal to advance. We have already made significant advancements in integrating the capabilities of Member States. When I took office, we had less than 40 modules registered at European level. I can report today that we have 124 modules registered at European level, plus eight coordination teams. The advancements we have taken are in response to the needs. Just for information, in 2010 alone, we activated our Civil Protection Mechanism 28 times. For reference: in previous years, it would be two, three, four or five times and this year, we already have activated it 11 times and the probability is that there may be more activations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me take a second point that was brought up by many MEPs – Mr Arsenis, Mr Czarnecki and Madam de Brún and, I am sure, others – on the importance of preparedness and prevention. We know that a euro invested in prevention brings four to seven euros in return. Yet, moving ahead with prevention has proven to be difficult in Europe and elsewhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We recognise how critically important prevention is. I have just come back from Washington where we in the Commission took the lead, together with the World Bank and the government of Japan, in making this question of preparedness and of prevention a high global priority, and we will continue with structured measures focusing on actions taken in prevention in order to boost this work.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will come back with additional legislative proposals in this area as we advance in our operational thinking. Of course, forests are a big part in our prevention measures. They matter in floods, they matter in being ready for forest fires, they matter in the ecological system for cities and rural areas. So, Mr Arsenis, you will see forests becoming a big part of our preparedness and prevention work.</p>
      <p sl="en">But preparedness is also training together, and this is where the Commission has already advanced our role. Just last Friday I was in Poland taking part in a five country preparedness exercise, Carpatex, and I can tell you that bringing our community of civil protection together is paramount in saving lives, and reducing property, and we in the Commission are dedicated to do more of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was asked by Mr Leinen and Mr Seeber how we coordinate with the High Representative and I can give you a very positive report that, on the basis of activations and practice in dealing with crises, we have advanced significantly the institutional arrangements and we have much more clarity in who does what, when and where.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, inside Europe, the High Representative has no role. Two-thirds of activations of the civil protection last year were inside Europe and there it is a matter of internal EU action. Outside Europe, we act as a first responder bringing civil protection humanitarian aid, whereas the High Representative has a role in political and defence coordination. Of course, in complex crises, the High Representative takes the lead and there we bring our skills and capabilities – this is best practice in our Member States, where civil protection is coordinated. Member States have their own civil protection coordination centres and politics and defence are coordinated. Sometimes, civil protection steps in and sometimes they have no role, depending on the type of crisis. Those of you who watched President Obama of the United States responding to the floods recently will have seen that he did it from the civil protection centre of the United States, but when you watch him, in the case of Bin Laden, he was in the situation room of the United States, in the White House.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, we do have separate roles, we do of course have to coordinate in complex emergencies and, depending on the emergencies, we define exactly how this coordination takes place.</p>
      <p sl="en">What obstacles do we face from Member States? The critical issue we face is to assure Member States that we are mindful of their legislative conditions, in other words, that we respect how civil protection is organised in each and every one of our Member States, and recognise that in national disasters, where there is no role for the European Union and the country can cope on its own, of course we will not interfere in this response.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States in current fiscal conditions and the budgetary environment want to be sure that we will be mindful of cost efficiency. I can give you my word that I am very fiscally prudent and that, yes, we will make sure that every euro of our taxpayers’ money is spent in the best possible and most effective manner. In other words, at Community level when it makes sense, and at the country level when it is more appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was also asked about how we deal with post-disasters. It is a very critical question to link relief to rehabilitation and development and to make sure that development assistance, including technical capabilities from the European Union, is made available to countries affected by disasters. We have taken some measures in that respect to improve the post-disaster risk assessment that is carried out and then make sure that the European contribution is in this context of internationally coordinated efforts in developing countries. I do agree that this is an area where more work needs to be done, and we have made it a priority with Commissioner Piebalgs for our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much agree with Ms de Brún that we must respect the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence when we provide humanitarian assistance, including civil protection in-kind assistance in developing countries, especially in areas that are affected not only by disasters, but also by conflicts. This must always be respected and I am grateful to Baroness Ashton for very much supporting this principle of neutrality and independence in humanitarian work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speakers including Ms Dăncilă – I apologise if I mispronounced the name – made a point on the Solidarity Fund. We work together with Commissioner Hahn to make a proposal for redefining the Solidarity Fund so that it can act immediately through a pre-funding arrangement in case a country is affected by disasters. Last year, I faced a very uncomfortable situation when floods affected Moldova and Romania. In Moldova, we can provide humanitarian assistance overnight, in Romania we cannot. I am therefore a very strong proponent of making sure that solidarity is expressed right at the time when people need it when a disaster hits.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of GMES, this is a pilot project that is very much on the priority list of the working programme for the Commission. The pilot project is now completed but the Commission intends to support GMES financially to the extent possible in the next multi-year financial framework and, of course, we count on Parliament to support our proposal so that it can be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, on the forest fire-fighting reserve, this is a pilot project that unfortunately came to an end. We cannot extend it, but we are going to include it in the legislative proposal. Talking about where we have difficulty with Member States, some of our Member States are really not in favour of it so we would need your support in Parliament. It is the right thing to do, we have seen it in the years we have applied it, but we still have some work to do to convince Member States that this funding arrangement has to be continued once the legislative proposal is being done. I apologise for taking so long, but there were very many good questions and I did not want to skip any of them.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The debate about strengthening EU disaster response gives us a good opportunity to examine the system of European disaster management in a broader context. Although I agree with the conclusions of the report, I believe that there are quite a number of questions that remain unanswered: Does the EU possess the appropriate financial means to protect not only against natural disasters, but also against industrial accidents with serious consequences? Do we have the means to allow rapid and effective damage control in the case of industrial disasters? If we have no answer to these questions – and I believe that we do not – then would this not be the right time to begin to develop a new set of effective financial instruments as soon as possible? I am convinced that the solution lies in a European disaster insurance system based on the principle of mandatory liability insurance, which would provide sufficient extra resources from the payments of potential industrial polluters to enable the EU to implement quick and efficient intervention. Injured parties would receive money immediately, while the risks deriving from potential non-payment by polluters could be spread out at EU level. Furthermore, payers could also become beneficiaries of the system by submitting applications for assistance for their safety and environmental investments from any unused funds. I believe that a substantive debate on this matter should begin as soon as possible, and we should not wait for another disaster to remind us of its necessity.</p>

      <p sl="en">The 2010 floods in Romania brought sudden disaster and tragic loss of life to many communities. Since then, we have seen many natural disasters unfold around the world, with significant human, environmental, and economic costs. The costs of both the immediate emergency response and long-term reconstruction are considerable. So I welcome this report’s emphasis on improving the flexibility and efficiency of the Solidarity Fund, which can provide valuable assistance to Member States and the assurance they need to release funds in the aftermath of a disaster. I also support the calls for a response capacity based on the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which pools capabilities and expertise from across the EU so as to provide the best and most efficient expert help during times of crises. Many disasters happen despite being entirely preventable. Last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a complete ban on the use of cyanide technology in mining projects because of the potential for cross-border environmental catastrophe in the event of an accident. Yet, despite this, the Romanian Government is about to approve such a mining project, which poses a grave threat to the environment and valuable cultural heritage of a whole region.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the global economy has changed dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years. Alongside the traditional economic powers like the European Union and the United States, thriving regions like Asia, in the form of China and India, or South America are emerging more and more out of the economic shadows.</p>
      <p sl="de">That also has to have an impact on our policies and our strategy. However, I am not convinced that the Commission’s new trade strategy will provide adequate answers to these changes. The challenges that the European Union is facing in the area of external trade can be illustrated very well with a few figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">By 2015, 90% of global growth will be generated outside the Union, with 50 countries, including the 27 Member States of the EU, accounting for 80% of world trade.

      <p sl="de">In 2000, at the launch of the Lisbon strategy, the European Union still accounted for 25% of world GDP. By 2020, this share will fall to just 18% of world GDP. While the two biggest developed economies, Europe and the United States, accounted for 48% of world GDP in the year 2000, this share will be down to a third by 2020. That is a relative decline of 27%.</p>
      <p sl="de">China and India will account for around a quarter of world economic output by 2020. That is a relative increase of 150%. In this regard, we need to bear in mind that the European Union’s economy is highly dependent on participating in external growth. Even today, 18% of the Union’s labour force, in other words, almost 40 million jobs, is dependent on the Union’s trade performance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The comparison between trade opening and employment over the past 10 years in almost all countries in the world shows that trade opening goes together with higher employment and job creation. Therefore, we must make use of these opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is something that I believe to be particularly important. The Commission is called on to present a revised mid- and long-term trade strategy by the summer of 2013. This should be possible on the basis of a thorough analysis of the current trends in world trade and a forecast of developments within and outside the European Union over the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be very pleased, Commissioner De Gucht, if you could assure us of that already today. I think that we need a genuine future-oriented strategy in order to better deal with the changes that have occurred over the last 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also briefly like to mention one particular paragraph contained in the report, and that is paragraph 11, because many people still only associate bad news, such as job relocations and environmental and social dumping, with trade or globalisation. Yes, these things do exist too, and it is our job to work together to tackle them.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we all experience the good side of trade on a daily basis: affordable products in our shops, export opportunities and new jobs, for example, in mechanical engineering, vehicle manufacturing or with service providers. The positive contribution made by trade policy to the combating of poverty also gets far too brief a mention in the public debate. In this regard, I would like to see a balanced information campaign by the Commission highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of external trade, and I would be extremely grateful if we could uphold this demand contained in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report most sincerely – all of the many colleagues in various talks and with more than 200 amendments in committee. I would like to thank Parliament’s administration and various external partners in dialogue from numerous different spheres who have supported us all with their background knowledge and their convictions and provided both positive and negative comments. It is now up to the Commission to take up our proposals and to implement them. We will be keeping a very watchful eye on this, Mr De Gucht.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Members for this opportunity to comment on the excellent report prepared by Daniel Caspary. I appreciate the frank and comprehensive analysis it makes of our communication on trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like to address one unwarranted criticism that this report raises, which is its lack of long-term vision. Parliament will also have seen the two detailed staff working documents which accompany our communication. One contains rigorous economic analysis as well as available long-term forecasts. The other presents an assessment of the Global Europe strategy adopted by the Commission in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the key priorities of our new trade strategy is to ensure stronger and sustainable growth in Europe by engaging with other strategic growth poles in the world: China, Russia, Japan, etc. I am sure that Members will agree with me that this is a legitimate long-term objective and not just a misguided short-term vision.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also strive to uphold the value of multilateralism and project our European values in the rest of the world, in an ever-increasing complex world where global governance and strong leadership seem to be in short supply. Unless you believe that multilateralism and our strong engagement with strategic partners will not be objectives worth pursuing by 2030 or beyond, then I find it hard to accept the report’s criticism of a lack of long-term vision.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to stress that the objectives and priorities set in the communication will produce economic effects in the next five to ten years. Today, 36 million jobs in the EU depend on our external trade. These jobs are important today and they will be as important in decades to come. If we are successful in our strategy, and not least if Parliament lends its support, our new trade policy can generate EUR 150 billion every year, and more jobs at the same time. These gains are long-term gains, which can only be reaped if we set a strong foundation for our policy today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I notice that we both share the aim of higher growth and consider that we should harness all the growth potential of external trade. The growth potential of the various trade initiatives that we are considering or pursuing is therefore a major factor allowing us to set priorities among the many negotiations which the Commission can engage in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the report considers that we are not ambitious enough and that our trade negotiations are too slow. Let us talk again when I return to this House to present concluded free trade agreements in the months and years to come. Of course, while it is important to be ambitious, it is equally important to understand that European trade policy does not solve all global issues and that global agreements are based on mutual obligations and commitments. Imposing obligations on our partners is only feasible if we ourselves are willing to make commitments which they consider equivalent. Otherwise, no deal is possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I am pleased to see that we agree on many of the priorities for the EU’s trade policy: multilateralism remains our top trade priority. The EU has a deep commercial and systemic interest in a strong multilateral trading system, and the Commission has played a proactive role in the Doha negotiations throughout 2011, including by developing a solid compromise proposal in the key area of tariffs on industrial goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also consistently called for deliverables for Least Developed Countries and we have an established, excellent track record already. In the coming period, ahead of the December Ministerial Conference, the Commission will continue its work in Geneva with the objective of finding a road map that can take the Doha negotiations out of the present impasse.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also states the importance of ensuring that trade works for poverty reduction. This is an issue that is also important for me and is why the Commission will submit to college a communication on trade, investment and development, by the end of November.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another area of importance mentioned several times in the report is ensuring that we are open but not naive, which I fully agree with. One initiative the Commission is working on is a legislative proposal for an EU instrument that will help secure and increase symmetry in access to public procurement markets in developed countries and large emerging markets. Procurement markets represent a substantial part of national economies, but European businesses cannot always get equal or easy access. The Commission has just ended the public consultation, is reviewing different options and will put forward a proposal within the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note that the report acknowledges the achievements of the market access strategy and the importance to continue to work towards keeping markets open. The Commission produced a trade and investment barriers report for the Spring European Council this year, which was shared with the Parliament as well. The report monitors barriers and protectionist measures and sets out a number of key priorities for market access action vis-à-vis our strategic partners, and should become the public reference document and benchmark for our enforcement action at political level. I welcome Parliament’s decision to also prepare a report on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are actively pursuing our market access work, in particular, in relation to intellectual property rights in third countries, access to key raw materials for EU industry and securing reliable energy supplies. We will also continue to enforce EU rights and defend the interests of EU businesses of all sizes – anti-dumping or anti-subsidy cases, bilateral discussions on market access barriers, negotiating trade deals and bringing cases before WTO. One example is how we have actively and consistently – and so far successfully – addressed issues relating to access to raw materials in China through the WTO’s dispute settlement system. In keeping with our enlightened openness, we have no qualms about using all instruments to ensure that all countries and companies comply with WTO rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I welcome a reference to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the report. The Commission is currently finalising a proposal to improve the fund and to extend it to the agricultural sector. This is scheduled for adoption on 5 October 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see much agreement between this report and the Commission’s own communication on trade policy and look forward to discussing it with Parliament. On the last question from Mr Caspary as to where I am going, I have only one answer: I am going forward.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Caspary for this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner De Gucht, you said to us here in March 2010: ‘viewed in the long term, trade is intended to help all inhabitants of this world to a better existence’. Unfortunately, in the Commission communication, this approach is not taken quite so clearly. For that reason, too, it was important for the report to deal expressly with the duty to provide a coherent policy. That is particularly important for the area of trade, as trade plays a very significant role in development cooperation. That makes it even harder to understand why it has not been included in the five key areas for policy coherence.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the Committee on International Trade has done a very good job on this report. Many of the suggestions from the Committee on Development have been included, for example, regarding the necessity and essential business friendliness of transparency initiatives, for example, in the raw materials sector. So thank you very much. The communication promised for the end of February will be important from the point of view of development policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am speaking today on behalf of Andrzej Grzyb, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the new trade policy for Europe. Mr Grzyb has drawn special attention to the need for equal access to new markets for enterprises both within and outside the EU, and has stressed, in particular, that EU enterprises should have access to foreign public procurement markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The opinion also emphasises the strategic importance of access to global raw materials and energy resources in order to sustain European security. This access should be guaranteed by appropriate international EU agreements. The opening up of markets should ensure that there is no adverse impact on the competitiveness of EU enterprises and should protect them against unfair competition. The solutions adopted should also eliminate pressure on these entities to move their business activities outside of the EU internal market. These issues are of specific importance to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are at particular risk of unfair practices and for which opportunities must be created to enable them to develop and compete in the global market. I am pleased that most of these proposals have been included in Mr Caspary’s report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am speaking in this debate first of all as the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, but also on behalf of my group as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this extremely comprehensive – and, I am pleased to say, very well-structured – report by Daniel Caspary, particularly as it incorporates many of the points that my committee made. In particular, I draw attention to the first clause of our report, which you incorporated in full and which in a way encapsulates our engagement with the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Single Market Act proposal on regulatory convergence is fully endorsed by this report. I think nothing could illustrate better the engagement of my committee with the trade process. We have had the pleasure of welcoming the Commissioner to come and talk to us because he knows our engagement with that. Non-tariff barriers are going to become more and more difficult to deal with and they will be the big areas of action, as the Commissioner already knows.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our work in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is dealing with non-tariff barriers within the single market all the time. We do not exist in isolation. That is why we have also recently visited both India and China to get an idea about how the impact of the internal market will work there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to pick up two points in particular because I think they are important, forward-looking points. I would say to Mr Caspary that we welcome inclusion of these but I do not think they have had enough emphasis. The first one is the question of standardisation. We must collaborate more with our trading partners to avoid inventing the new barriers to trade in developing technology areas – things like nanotechnology, smart grids and electric cars. Why should we be inventing new barriers there?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, innovation, which is linked to that. There is hardly anything in here about the need for encouraging science technology collaboration in innovative products. That is a key imperative.</p>
      <p sl="en">I conclude with this point: trade for growth – unlocking the benefits of trade – is indispensable to growth in the European economy. I hope that trade issues will be absolutely on the agenda of the forthcoming European Council where we start talking about growth in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I should like firstly to congratulate Daniel Caspary, not only for the excellent quality of his report, but also for the open and collaborative method which guided all of the work involved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text which we are going to adopt reflects the aspirations and doubts of MEPs, whatever their political group or nationality. In particular, it highlights one of our main concerns, which is the need for a genuine long-term trade strategy. Moreover, I think, Commissioner De Gucht, despite what you just said, that the Commission’s communication of November 2010 is insufficient in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the communication fails to take account of the current context of crisis and not only that of economic crisis, but also that affecting international trade. I am referring here, for example, to the stalemate in the Doha Development Round negotiations and to the emergence of new non-tariff barriers which we are seeing even from our oldest trading partners. Moreover, this communication does not take account of changes in trade policy. The rapporteur states it clearly: ‘Trade policy is not an end in itself.’ Yet, we get the impression that the Commission has yet to integrate this new reality into its work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall cite another example: members of your departments regularly come to the Committee on International Trade to inform us of progress in free trade agreement negotiations. In this context, we question them on the inclusion of social and environmental standards, the importance given to the agricultural chapter, or even on the reciprocity of market access. However, in the evasive answers we receive, these issues are often eluded in favour of purely trade-related chapters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, this bias is no longer viable. Commissioner, I should like to declare my support for Mr Caspary’s request: the Commission must quickly present a clear, global and long-term vision for trade policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me add my congratulations to Daniel Caspary for his report and for his cooperation. I welcome the report and the Commission’s communication on the future of EU trade policy. As the rapporteur points out, the harsh reality is that the EU share of global trade is declining, and without action it will continue to decline. Thirty-six million jobs in the European Union depend on external trade. Unless we boost our exports, there will be no economic recovery. Job creation and poverty alleviation at home and abroad must be at the core of our global trade strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report acknowledges, as Mrs Saïfi has just said, that trade is not an end in itself. It can, of course, be a driver for growth, which, in turn, fuels prosperity and rising living standards, but trade is also influenced by, and can influence, human rights standards, labour standards, environmental standards, and they must be key components of our trade policy, not as an alternative to trade liberalisation, but as a key component of it. We need policy coherence between our trade policy, our development policy, our environmental, social and labour policies. The promotion of fair trade is already benefiting around 7.5 million people across 58 developing countries. I hope the Commission will listen to Parliament and continue to promote fair-trade policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key message I want to take out of this report, though, is that, across the groups, we have managed to create a good framework for Europe’s trade policy. The test, however, is not in creating such a framework, the test is in applying that framework to the individual free trade agreements that we are about to debate, the individual legislation such as the GSP legislation that is going to come before this Parliament. Unless we put the contents of this report into action in our individual free trade agreements, the individual pieces of trade legislation, it will end up being a meaningless piece of paper.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to commend Mr Caspary for his excellent report which addresses all aspects of the EU’s trade strategy from a truly liberal point of view. It is extremely important that the EU remains committed to this approach and avoids repeating the errors made in the 1930s, when the economic crisis marked the emergence of aggressive protectionism. The danger of this is even more flagrant considering the difficulties being encountered in concluding the Doha Development Round negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I expect a more exhaustive strategy on trade from the Commission. I should like to know, for example, with which countries we are intending to launch negotiations for a free trade agreement between now and 2020. I would also like to know which non-tariff barriers we are aiming to eliminate between now and 2020 with Russia, the US and China. Furthermore, I would like to know how we are going to address the problems with countries with whom we are bound by a Customs Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to see more ambition from the Commission, in order to ensure growth, and also that our principles on development, human rights and the environment are integrated into trade policies. Trade must be used to help poor developing countries and the Least Developed Countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we must provide the tools required to boost growth, which the European Union absolutely needs, while forging an ambitious and coherent trade policy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Caspary for addressing all of the issues that are important to us – human rights, labour law, social responsibility, the environment, the climate, consumer protection, in particular, protection of generics, and the right to take non-protectionist measures by way of protection against unfair competition and dumping.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, both the Commission communication and the report still have an outdated focus on continued liberalisation. The demand for the elimination of export taxes is reminiscent of colonial raw materials policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What would we say if the Swedish steel industry was not permitted to work with high-grade steel, but was forced to export all raw materials? No, those countries that want to should be able to retain the added value in their country with the aid of export taxes, which are often also an important source of income.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The same applies with regard to the continued demand for procurement and the liberalisation of services. These countries must be able to decide for themselves whether to benefit from this or whether it is more important to promote certain local industry. Each country must be able to decide this for itself.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I then wonder how this policy – it is even referred to as ‘growth’ – could be compatible with our climate ambitions. Show me an analysis and demonstrate that there has been some decoupling between global trade, growth, emissions and the use of resources.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like the Commission to show me these studies before it presents the next outdated growth proposals. You need to have more green economy that is not dependent on growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Not all trade is necessary. Half of the world’s trade is in equivalent products. We should trade when it provides significant added value: we should buy those things that we are not good at producing ourselves and export those things that we are good at producing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, I acknowledge the fact that, as rapporteur, you have shown yourself within your own group to be thoroughly open to the demand for a modern trade policy with this report. Paragraph 5 of your report in particular emphasises the fact, at last, that trade policy requires coherence with a great many other policy areas as well as future viability, and I expressly support your call for a thorough revision of the trade strategy by Commissioner De Gucht.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of this report then falls back into the old way of thinking. You want to promote the interests of the EU instead of establishing partnerships. You support an aggressive market access strategy by the Commission, which would weaken the development potential of other countries. You want to use whatever means necessary to secure access to raw materials for European enterprises instead of finally offering fair prices and providing assistance for the development of manufacturing industries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will vote against this old way of thinking, because the consequence of continuing with this old strategy will, above all, be the extension of the spiral of poverty in most parts of the world. That is short-sighted, also because it will ultimately harm Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">How do you actually imagine it will end if we pursue competition for the raw materials of the world by aggressive means? Where will we be in 2050? Will all of the states in the world then have a raw materials management strategy like that of Norway? Will it have been possible to develop manufacturing industries? Will Europe have helped them to do this in an environmentally sound way and to create respectable jobs? Europe’s future lies in a smart trade policy that aims to strengthen its partners and which recognises that combating poverty is a prerequisite for its own survival.</p>

      <p sl="it">Thank you for the report, which offers no way out at all. Somebody will have to explain to me what the Commission’s farsightedness entails. The details put forward here actually portray a debacle of what Europe is not. The prevailing interests are those of certain Northern European countries that want to liberalise everything and trade, regardless of social dumping and the imbalances we have with our so-called partners, but without any interest or protection for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essentially British and German interests that are being defended both by the Commission and by the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I smile when I see in the report that the Member States and the Commission are being urged to communicate better, since the people of the European Union are sick to death of globalisation because of the loss of productivity.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Caspary report rightly points out that free trade is not an end in itself, that there are economic, social, environmental and moral interests which must be defended, and that perhaps globalisation is not as wonderful as the Commission continues to believe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problem is that the Caspary report is founded on a belief that this globalisation is inescapable and, inevitably, in a belief in the virtues of global free trade, slightly improved at the fringes by some regulation or other. Yet, this system, as it has been operating for almost 60 years, has proven to be deeply unfair and destructive. It must therefore be changed. Widespread free movement of capital, goods, services and people has led to mass unemployment, relocalisation, deindustrialisation, pressure on wages, frenzied speculation and ultimately, whether you like it or not, to the unprecedented global crisis which we are experiencing today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will not, in the near future, be competitive in relation to countries which use and abuse their comparative advantages, which do not respect their international commitments, and which practise dumping and counterfeiting.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, aside from the work which Mr Caspary has done, I find that the new trade strategy proposed by the Commission does not address the challenges which Europe has to face in light of the financial, economic, social, environmental and food crises we are experiencing, nor does it address the expectations of our fellow citizens who are calling for stronger regulation and for a new sustainable growth and development model for the planet. Unfortunately, however, this does not or no longer comes as a surprise. Faced with these calls for new regulation and new solidarity, the Union must establish a new doctrine for an alternative trade policy. If Europe does not advocate a fairer form of trade that is founded on the values of justice and that generates quality employment in both Europe and the rest of the world, who will?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Solely promoting services is not a policy. We need to preserve strong industrial and agricultural sectors through an employment-generating industrial policy and an updated CAP. The inclusion in all of our free trade agreements of social and environmental standards, and stringent human rights rules which guarantee decent working conditions, is fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe must lead the way in balancing trade openness with room for public intervention and the legitimate protection of various economic sectors both in Europe and in its partner countries – a fair trade policy for fair trade should be the aim.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we Greens deeply regret that the revised trade strategy marks a clear shift away from multilateral trade talks towards new bilateral trade agreements. We are concerned that the Commission is seeking liberalisation commitments from developing countries on services, intellectual property and the so-called ‘Singapore issues’ that go well beyond what they would agree to in multilateral fora such as the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">The introduction of the reciprocity principle regarding public procurement can be extremely harmful for developing countries as it will, among other things, hamper the development of infant industries and processing. I therefore ask the Commission to define its trade strategy in full respect of the special and differential treatment granted to developing countries by the WTO. Governments and parliaments must be able to regulate investment, both to discriminate in favour of investors that support their country’s development, and to ensure that obligations and duties fall on all investors, including foreign investors.</p>

      <p sl="nl">If Europe is going into the negotiations with this shopping list, then it will be putting paid to any chances of success from the outset.

We have to play a leading role and not a supporting one in seeking to conclude the Doha Round with a well-balanced global agreement, which is an essential condition for arriving at a free-trade agreement that really opens up the markets and, above all, creates equal opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">Trade policy and economic governance go hand in hand in this world, and we are therefore calling for a new financial system and a new monetary and exchange rate policy, as well as a redefinition of trade protection measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the statistics quoted by Mr Caspary are rather frightening – from 25% of GDP in 2000, now the European Union will have only 18% by 2020, from 19% of world exports in 1999 to 17% of world exports in 2009, and yet the Union’s population is due to increase 5% by 2035 – all pointing to a poorer, and therefore less influential, European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time for action, and aggressive action at that. I would note that two committees – the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Development – both point to the need to reduce the existing trade deficit with China and have increased access to this expanding market. That is certainly an area we need to address and address fairly quickly. Our FTAs, such as the one we have with Korea, also need to be expanded.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, unstable prices for food products and goods have become a major issue, exacerbating the state of deprivation of millions of people, and jeopardise the operation of the global financial system. Trade imbalances and speculative activities are the source of this volatility, and climate change will continue to make it worse. A European strategy on trade policy must deal with the key role that the European Union needs to assume as part of the multilateral trade system. This long-term strategy must have precise goals, take into account the development of the international trade system and highlight aspects which are compatible with EU principles, such as the importance of making generic medicines available to the poorest or the need to include, as a matter of course, fair trade, human rights and social and environmental standards in every trade agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the fact that the European Union generated 25% of global GDP at the time when the Lisbon strategy was implemented in 2000, but is expected to have a share of just 18% in 2020, is clearly a cause for serious reflection. A sober assessment of the current situation, taking account of the reality of today’s global economy, is acutely necessary in order to draw up resolute short, medium and long-term strategies for the revival of the EU economy and its competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that the concluding of trade agreements and the opening up of the European market should not take place at the expense of the safety of EU consumers and the values on which the EU is based.

      <p sl="it">Paragraph 11 in the report seems to suggest, however, that everything comes down to a mere problem of communication. On the contrary, the crisis in Europe is real and certainly not a problem of communication.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the Commission’s communication on trade is essentially a continuation of the Global Europe strategy of 2006. Unfortunately, the strategy also results from the frustration of European businesses over the dead-end street which the Doha Round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations ended up in.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since things have gone wrong at the multilateral level, the EU is trying to engage in bilateral agreements, particularly with countries that have rapidly growing economies. This form of EU trade policy is ultra-liberal, however, focusing almost exclusively on economic development and economic motivations. All other non-trade aspects such as sustainable development, social cohesion, human rights and the like are sidelined. These aspects should be a priority, however, cutting across all EU policies, including trade policy. Unfortunately, it is not only outside the Union that this does not apply. An attempt to undermine social and environmental standards is also under way inside the Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would therefore like to call on the Commission not to succumb to pressure, and to draw up a strategy that will genuinely respect our European values.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, unfortunately, I will have to be very brief. I would very much like to go into the arguments that have been put forward, but I will just give one overall reply, taking up the idea that was put forward by David Martin. You have to see in practice what all these big ideas mean.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me begin with development. Everybody is saying that a development strategy should be part of our trade strategy. Whatever you may think about human rights in China – that is quite a different chapter – it is very difficult to deny that their development over the last three decades has contributed largely to remedy the shortage of jobs and livelihoods in that country and has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the non-tariff measures, in recent days, we have been discussing the last phase of Russia’s entry into the WTO. This concerns non-tariff free barriers. and the discussion on cars. I can assure you that this is a very tough discussion. It is not about principles but about money, cars, parts and components, jobs, and delocalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">You speak about sustainable development. I am very much in favour of that and we make sure that in every free trade agreement which we conclude, this sustainable development chapter is included. But I can assure you that when you discuss this with India, first of all, you have to spend quite a long time discussing whether or not they will agree that such a chapter is in the agreement and then you still have to start discussing the content of such a chapter. They have completely different ideas about this which can be explained by a lot of reasons, development, culture, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">Raw materials are a very important example, as has been said here, but we are doing something about it. We are on the case on raw materials with China and you can see that this is already influencing the quota on rare earth materials. It is also having an impact on the prices, as prices of rare-earth materials are going down. There are also a lot of initiatives in Europe and elsewhere in the developed world to use those materials less, thus also contributing to the protection of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">They were just a couple of examples. Unfortunately, I cannot develop this further because I must keep to the time.</p>

      <p sl="de">I thank the Non-attached Members for their fundamental opposition. Mr Gollnisch was fundamentally opposed to the report because it is too liberal, Ms Stassen was fundamentally opposed to it because we are too protectionist; however I have not seen a single amendment from either of them in committee. I think that is a shame, because all of us in Europe need less empty rhetoric in plenary and more constructive work in the committees. Our committee, in particular, is one of the most constructive and collegial committees that I know in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Caspary, on his excellent report. He covers the important areas that are essential for a revised trade strategy for the European Union and points out the approaches that need to be taken in order for Europe to remain competitive at international level in the future. I would like to address three issues in particular here. The first is the clear commitment of the European Parliament to a multilateral trading system that establishes uniform rules and standards. We need a common trading framework on which we also all need to continue to work and which we must also continue to develop together. Therefore, I would once again call for the Doha Development Agenda to be brought to a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone. Secondly, Europe is facing strong competition from new economic powers that, over the next few years, will continue to develop their position. Therefore, we must speed up the removal of unjustified barriers to trade, particularly where our most important partners, the US, China, Russia, Japan and India, are concerned. I would like to highlight the demand that I made, which received majority support in the European Parliament: a sustainability chapter must be included in any trade agreement between the EU and third countries, covering the production and processing of goods. In the event that this is not complied with, trade with these third countries should be stopped. Ensuring food quality as well as hormone-free food must have top priority in the interests of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Although the European economy is the largest in the world, with the EU being the main exporter, as well as the main provider and beneficiary of direct foreign investments, it is estimated that 90% of global growth will be generated outside Europe by 2015. In the coming years, the European Union must capitalise, without fail, on the opportunities provided by high levels of growth outside the EU. In this regard, I would like to mention public procurement, as this is an area where foreign markets are largely closed to EU companies. Accounting, on average, for more than 10% of these countries’ GDP, public procurement contracts offer considerable commercial opportunities in the sectors where EU industry is highly competitive. Given that our market is already wide open, I think that the clear priority for establishing reciprocal access is not to close European markets, but to open up foreign public procurement markets. Therefore, I strongly urge the EU to step up its efforts to facilitate access for European companies to public procurement contracts outside the EU and to eliminate discriminatory practices.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Global trade brings benefits to all involved. It is my opinion, therefore, that we should proceed towards the elimination of barriers and restrictions. However, the necessity to retain a balance of benefits between participating parties is a limiting factor in such liberalisation. Trade policy has to fulfil certain criteria, particularly in terms of the requirement for imported goods to comply with European safety standards, as well as in terms of social issues, manufacturing conditions and the environmental impact of manufacturing, as these are the basis for maintaining competitiveness. It is especially important in the context of the costs that must be borne by European manufacturers to comply with environmental standards and maintain working conditions and levels of pay. Trade strategy is a significant element of a broader development strategy. It gains further importance in the context of the struggle to cope with the economic crisis. Therefore, trade conditions established by the World Trade Organisation need to promote equality in trade levels and capacity. I would also like to highlight the critical issue of unity and solidarity within the EU in terms of foreign trade. There are numerous examples of our partners dividing the Union by offering preferential conditions for selected Member States. The single market requires uniformity in foreign trade.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The EU 2020 strategy has ambitious and measurable objectives, and the new trade policy for Europe is an essential component of the strategy. A number of factors are important for trade, and have an effect on it. As an example, I could mention adequate protection for intellectual property, particularly trademarks. Counterfeiting and the importing of counterfeit products lead to job losses, undermine innovation and reduce the competitiveness of the EU, and also involve safety risks in relation to consumer products. Another important factor is support for job creation, according the same rights and tax advantages to domestic investors as to foreign investors, expanding free and fair trade in agricultural products, and the sharing of innovations and technologies not only between Member States, but also within the framework of trade relations with superpowers such as China, Russia, the US and Japan.</p>

There are still extremely disturbing reports coming from Colombia in relation to the human rights situation in the country’s regions. Human rights activists, lawyers and trade unionists are still being murdered in Colombia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would think that, before we move on to ratifying the free trade agreement with Colombia, we would first need to see real improvements in this regard. Despite the promises of President Santos, with whom we spoke last year – or at least some of us did – the situation has still not really improved significantly. I would like to hear a word from you on this – an undertaking might suffice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My other question is for Commissioner Georgieva and concerns linking relief, rehabilitation and development.

      <p sl="nl">I am convinced, personally, that this agreement can help to stabilise peace in Colombia. In other words, I believe that the economic progress that will surely result from the agreement can make a positive contribution. I know that there are problems with human rights. Indeed, it is stated explicitly in the agreement that the observance of human rights is one of the material elements of the agreement and that, if we –or you – determine that these human rights are being systematically violated, we will have the ability to immediately terminate the agreement without giving any further justification.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Overall, I believe that this agreement can make a positive contribution. I am convinced that the Colombian Government is acting in good faith in its efforts to curtail and eliminate violations of human rights.

      <p sl="en">We have made linking relief, rehabilitation and development a priority for cooperation with Commissioner Piebalgs. The way we approach it is at three levels: a strategy level, an operational modalities level and then a country-specific level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Strategically, we launched a high-level dialogue on humanitarian action in development in Washington just a couple of days ago, and made a commitment to link the work we do in protracted-crisis and in disaster-prone countries – some 30 countries in the world fall into this category – in order to make that a strategic area for collaboration.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of instruments, we are looking at how we can better align the instruments we have on the humanitarian side, which work fast, with instruments on the development side, which sometimes require more time. We will be making appropriate proposals in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will give two examples at the country-specific level: Côte d’Ivoire, where, after the crisis, we committed EUR 60 million for relief and EUR 180 million for development, viewing those operations in synergy; and the Horn of Africa, where very clearly we need to do more to build resilience in the countries concerned.</p>

The remaining activists have fled and she is now the only one left in her home town. You cannot look someone like this lady in the eye and simply say that we need to just sign this agreement.

In Mali and Niger, because of our common work, we can manage or diminish considerably the risk of famine there.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Colombia, I think the question Mr Berman has asked is very challenging because when you commit, you need to analyse all elements of the relations with the country and the processes of the country.

      <p sl="en">Obviously, this is unacceptable to us. We are, as you know, in a negotiating round with Ukraine on a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA), and one of the main elements of that agreement is that policies would be modelled on EU directives. The EU directive concerned relates to public procurement and says very clearly that, unless justified by the subject matter of the contract, technical specifications shall not refer to a specific make or source or a specific origin or production with the effect of favouring or eliminating certain undertakings or certain products.

      <p sl="en">Two weeks ago, the plenary held a vote on the Doha resolution, in which the amendments of the ALDE Group were rejected. Those ALDE amendments were the very reflection of the position of DG TRADE, namely, to regard any kind of LDC package delivery at the December WTO Ministerial as a mere down payment and to ask WTO members to agree on a road map for reaching agreement on all outstanding Doha issues. Instead, Parliament’s resolution gives a clear message to close up the Doha negotiations now in order to pave the way for WTO reform. Can you tell us how the Commission will adjust its Doha strategy in light of those Parliament positions on how you will take our position into account?</p>

I have just been appointed as a European Parliament standing rapporteur on trade relations with China, as well as on relations between the EU and Ecuador and Bolivia. I would like to ask you two questions regarding these two complexes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, what is your projection for the development of trade relations between the EU and China by the year 2020, and what are the current issues, or even agreements, in EU-China trade talks?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, you informed yesterday’s Council on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the multiparty agreement with Colombia and Peru remains open for signature by Ecuador and Bolivia.

      <p sl="en">Members will understand that it is difficult to reply in two minutes on what our trade relations with China will be in 2020. Having said that, I believe that you will see a situation evolving between the European Union, China, the United States and the other emerging economies – and by 2020, there will also be other emerging economies – that is more and more multipolar, with everybody then having to take up their responsibilities. You cannot be one of the biggest economies in the world – and by 2020 we could very well be the biggest – and not take up responsibility for the global functioning of the world trading system. So I am not desperate about this, or even negative about it. I think we can find a way out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the agreement with Colombia and Peru, it is true that the agreement is open for accession by Ecuador and Bolivia. We realised that if they were ready to do so – and at least for one of them, we have signs in that direction – some further discussions would, of course, be needed. However, I am sure that Mr Scholz will agree with me that we cannot change the structure of that agreement. We will have some specifications for the countries concerned, but we are certainly not going to restart the whole process.</p>

      <p sl="en">The proposal for building the civil protection system of Europe in a more predictable manner in order to act when a country is overwhelmed by disaster either inside Europe or outside Europe requires countries to identify modules, civil protection modules, which they are willing to deploy in a disaster outside of their borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">As of today, we have 124 such modules registered at European level, plus eight coordination modules, and the proposal means that we will be able predictably to match the needs of a country in a disaster, whether this be floods, forest fires or summer or winter storms or an earthquake, and then bring help from those pre-identified and pre-committed modules to the affected population. We already have examples of how this can be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="hu">My second question is that if I were to organise it, would you be willing to sit down to negotiate with representatives of the most important stakeholders, that is, farmers, not only from Europe, including my home country, Hungary, and other EU Member States, but also from the third world, from so-called developing countries, poverty-stricken countries, from where I would similarly invite representatives of small producers?

      <p sl="en">I think that trade plays a very fundamental role on the markets, because markets provide price signals and the need for investment. Having said this, in development policy, we have clearly seen the need to go towards more sustainable agricultural investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In many parts of the world, there is not sufficient infrastructure to access the market. Farmers in developing countries do not have sufficient means or knowledge to produce more food. In Africa, we will need to nearly triple yields over the next 40 years. That is why development policy will, in particular, be focusing on supporting farmers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would definitely discourage a sub-culture of working towards self-sufficiency methods. There have been such attempts in the world. They always failed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also take a very important factor into account. There are good and bad years in agriculture. If a region has a bad year, what should we do? Humanitarian aid can give the chance of surviving for a certain period, but basically, we very much need to have global trade systems in agricultural commodities.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Commissioner De Gucht, one of the international trade dossiers for which I was appointed rapporteur relates to the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Uzbekistan on textiles. However, the use of forced child labour for harvesting cotton makes it difficult to adopt a strictly technical approach to the protocol. In actual fact, at the beginning of October, hundreds of children will be forced to harvest cotton by hand in order to supplement the shortage of adult labour. This is an extreme form of labour for children who, according to NGOs, are punished by those in charge if they fail to meet the quotas they have been set. Uzbekistan’s ratification of the International Labour Organisation conventions on the minimum employment age and the elimination of the most severe forms of forced child labour are a positive sign, but these actions actually fall short in terms of their implementation.</p>

What we are trying to do is to negotiate a balanced deal with Mercosur, taking into account the interests of the farming community, as well as our very important export of industrial products to Mercosur, the markets with respect to services, and European investments in the Mercosur countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are by far the most important investor in those countries and we will try to get to a balanced deal. We cannot make much progress at the present time because, as a result of – let us say – internal political agendas in Mercosur, we have decided to wait for the exchange of offers. This will take some time but, in the meantime, we are already addressing the problems that you have raised. For example, there is the Commission proposal that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund would also be eligible for farmers.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden published a report this year which showed that beef coming from Brazil has carbon emissions of 700 kilograms per kilogram of beef, taking into account deforestation, etc. The corresponding figure for grass-based production in Europe, especially in my own country and others, is 20 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of beef. That is 35 times higher for Brazilian beef.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am not aware of the specific study carried out by the Swedish University. However, when you compare farming in Mercosur and in Europe, there are, of course, huge differences. What we have to look at, and what is also our limit, is what is enforceable within the WTO. For instance, the example that you gave – provided that it is completely correct, which I do not doubt but cannot confirm either – does certainly not come within the scope of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also look at the global balance with respect to climate change.

Mr De Gucht, I have a question regarding the WTO case concerning China and the rare earth problem. I think nobody would say that China is right in this case. I think what the WTO did in this case is the right step, but I have one concern. If the tendency in general is to make countries export rare materials, as the WTO is doing now, do you not think, if a very small country or a developing country or a very weak country is involved, this tendency of the WTO might allow big companies to force these countries to do as they want them to do? Or do you think that will not be a problem?</p>

      <p sl="en">The case before the WTO was about dual pricing, namely, that China obtained prices for local consumption and production that were different from the prices for exports, by imposing export duties and enforcing a quota. What the WTO panel has been deciding – the matter is now before the Appellate Body, so we will have to wait for the final decision – is that the justification that China was giving was not correct. The justification was for environmental reasons. The panel said that, if the environmental reasons were valid for export, they were also valid locally, so this was not a valid answer to the questions put by the European Union, the United States and Mexico.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what we have been enforcing. I hope this will have an impact on the rare earth materials. We already see that: quotas are not going down and prices are going down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding your specific question with respect to weaker countries, first of all, we have launched this case against China because the trade with China in raw materials is of paramount importance. I do not think we would immediately start such a case against whatever small country you might have in mind because what we are worried about is, of course, the global balance in the trade in raw materials.</p>

What I am just a little bit fearful of is that there might be a tendency, if the direction taken in this case continues as it is now, that maybe we will go further, from rare earth to raw materials. Ultimately, states will not be able to fulfil their obligations towards their own people with their own raw materials.</p>

You have to look at the specific case of course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, members of the Commission, Commissioner De Gucht, more and more trade agreements in the European Union lay down rules on matters that are nothing to do with trade policy. One example of this is the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Instead of restricting itself to the key issue of anti-counterfeiting and setting the appropriate boundaries in connection with trade, this agreement is used as a way of harmonising comprehensive rules for enforcing intellectual property rights in the contracting states. However, that is definitely not your job as Commissioner for Trade – in my view, it would instead be Ms Reding’s job – nor is the content formulated in line with EU contract law or the legal bases in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question to you, therefore, is: how do you actually intend to ensure that issues relating to fundamental rights in particular are debated in a democratic way at international level in connection with enforcement of the law and are also given a mandatory influence in the legal bases?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-147-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Karel De Gucht" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">We have repeatedly discussed the ACTA agreement and the ACTA negotiations over the last year. We will, of course, continue to do so. Within a reasonable time, the agreement will come to you for ratification. Let me repeat what I have already said a dozen times before this Parliament. This is not about changing the material law on intellectual property rights in Europe. It is about enforcement. It is about creating the possibility, on a wider scale, to enforce intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights are important, especially for a very mature economy like ours. I know that there is opposition. I know that we will have to face that opposition, but I trust that, in the end, you will agree.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is certainly the case that, especially with regard to the revolutions in North Africa for example, we can see that an open Internet and access to the Internet are essential – the question therefore is how you, as Commissioner for Trade, intend to protect fundamental rights, for example, access to the Internet, in a positive way in such trade agreements. If you say that violations do not occur, well that is disputable. However, it is also possible to take preventive action to ensure that these violations do not occur as things progress. I would be grateful for an answer to this question.</p>

If they want to do so, we discuss services with them. We do this with a view to the development of those societies.</p>

We try to contribute to that.</p>

Obviously, there, the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment that we will keep in mind in further discussions with Colombia. On the other hand, I must say – and of course I may be mistaken, I am only a human being – that, from what I have seen with the Uribe Government and now again with the Santos Government, they are making real efforts to advance the cause of human rights.

Many countries in fact place severe restrictions on the export of raw hides, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for our companies to work with the product. An agreement is currently being drawn up with Ukraine which seems to provide for a 10-year transitional period before the sector is fully liberalised. Do you not think that 10 years is too long? Maybe just three or five years would be enough.</p>

The export duties are on a very limited number of products and they will disappear within a period of 10 years, which means that it is going steadily down and will be zero at the end. I think that we will probably be able to make quite a good agreement in this respect because the safeguard clause too, with respect to those materials, will disappear and will go down to zero over a period of 15 years.

Subsidisation in all kinds of ways: cheap loans, cheap land for plants and so on. What we do see is a very rapid wage rise in the coastal area, which is the developed area of China.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the idea that it is merely because of low wages that the Chinese can compete on the world market is certainly not correct. There are many elements in play and what we should do instead is look at how we can integrate the Chinese development into the world economy and there we have obligations on both sides. We have them on our side. They should also realise that they have their obligations and that they should live up to the WTO obligations.

      <p sl="en">On the currency issue, it is true that the currency of China is undervalued and it is not good that a currency does not reflect the strength of an economy, so they should adapt. But on the other hand, there are always two sides to every coin. You should realise that two thirds of what we import from China we re-export, to the extent that if the Renminbi were to suddenly rise, a surge would also certainly harm our economy.

      <p sl="it">Initiating this trade highlights the fact that we can no longer use this country just as a potential market, since until now, our exports to Palestine have been worth EUR 50 million and our imports from there only EUR 6 million. Instead, away from Israeli control, the country is preparing itself to play a role as an exporter to Europe, which we hope can truly help to change the fortunes of the Palestinian people in particular.</p>

However, we have to recognise reality here and the reality is that its impact will be extremely limited because the problem is not simply goods entering the European markets but goods exiting the occupied territories in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The collective punishment of the blockade of Gaza has inflicted a humanitarian catastrophe on the people of Gaza. Eighty per cent of people now are reliant on food aid. Unemployment is at 45% and 300 000 people are forced to try and survive on less than one dollar a day.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, the economy has been deliberately destroyed by Israeli actions. Before the blockade, over 700 trucks used to leave Gaza with exports on a daily basis; today, less than 2% of the pre-blockade level of exports exist and simply tonnes and tonnes of fruit and flour are rotting and so, if the EU is serious about assisting the Palestinian people, gestures like this are simply not enough. It must end its complicity with the Israeli occupation.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe this agreement is a good example of how the EU can do a little bit of good in the world and make a small difference to the condition of the Palestinian people.

However, I do believe that this House should have the issue of balance, fairness and equality uppermost in its mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present, the ACCA agreement between the European Union and Israel, signed in May 2010, has come to a standstill as a result of this institution’s reluctance to approve it. It is common knowledge that Israel is one of the most advanced countries in the fields of medicine and technology. In postponing approval for this agreement, we are denying European consumers access to a wider range of high-quality medication, and blocking the possibility of lower prices for these products as well as the introduction of innovative technology into the European market.</p>

      <p sl="en">When we look at the problems that Palestinian farmers face, we know there are problems for many farmers around the globe, but in Palestine, there are particular difficulties – simple but huge difficulties – in accessing water, land and, of course, accessing markets, which is why this agreement is hugely significant. It means that we can help development through trade and – as others have said – it will not have any negative impacts for European Union agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the issue of standards. While the Palestinians are very keen to meet our standards, they also have to meet Israeli standards that are not the same as European Union ones. We need to see some progress in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The agreement, however, has a more profound objective than commercial interests, as Europe will benefit very little from trade with Palestine. With this agreement, we will help the economic development of the Palestinian territories; we will reduce poverty in the area and be instrumental in promoting its political stability. Trade can help facilitate the development of the economy and social issues in the Palestinian territories in Gaza and on the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In future, the European Union must have a strong role to play in foreign policy, and particularly with regard to its neighbouring states. Trade is our strongest political tool.

The European Union has not hesitated to answer that question collectively. It has responded to the debt crisis by a massive increase in debt, forcing additional liabilities on to countries that could not meet their existing liabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rather than correcting the malinvestments of the decade of cheap credit, we have rewarded those malinvestments, bailing out, first, banks and then entire countries. And now, that ‘bailout-and-borrow’ policy has reached is apogee. If reports are to be believed, the European Stabilisation Fund is going to be quadrupled – with yet more borrowing – into a EUR 2 million fund: a sum that our minds are not designed to comprehend.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the logical end of the policy we began on when we started borrowing. And who, ultimately, is going to stand behind this fund?

      <p sl="it">Research and innovation are both vital for development and economic growth. It is therefore urgent to propose a common framework for reorganising the existing schemes and programmes. Although Europe is the richest macro-region in the world, it has not actually invested properly in research, development and innovation. Suffice it to say that investment in these areas has been appreciably higher in the United States and Japan.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore have to act quickly to remove the inequalities that remain between the various countries of Europe. That will be the only possible way to prevent the scientifically or technologically more advanced countries from continuing to benefit more from existing European programmes.

This came home very clearly to me recently when I chaired here in Parliament a hearing on IT and the future of medicine, where many billions have been spent on research and medicine but the prevalence of the major disease continues to rise. Therefore, there is a need for a change of tactics and, hopefully, with this programme, which will be coming before the Commission in due course, research and innovation will produce a different approach where we can deal with the patient as the virtual patient with specific diagnosis and specific remedies as opposed to the generic which we have at present.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is a matter of pulling the lever that can truly usher in a period of growth and also of new skilled employment, such as that done by researchers and young people who devote themselves precisely to the new opportunities in innovation and technology and associated professions.</p>
      <p sl="it">One observation in particular emerges from this work, which is that we in Europe must put increasing emphasis on the kinds of research and innovation that find practical application, originate new companies, result in new patents and do not remain pure basic research or pure knowledge, which is certainly important, but not to the extent that it actually triggers development.</p>

      <p sl="it">At times of crisis, unfortunately, there is always a tendency to cut spending almost across the board on culture, education and social matters, and there is especially a tendency to take a conservative approach, something that should certainly not be supported. This report highlights a concern expressed by a large group of representatives of parents whose children attend European Schools, who also turned to the Committee on Petitions because they had the feeling that the budgetary changes would not include a commitment to the new programme for European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report certainly presents an intelligent plan to try to respond positively to the concerns expressed by the people in question and, at the same time, to give some substance to the European institutions’ policy.

In committee we found that, firstly, the European Schools’ system exists, secondly, it is a success story and, thirdly, we obviously need to carry out structural adjustments, but these must not be at the expense of the European Schools or the concept of European Schools.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Schools were set up with the aim of ensuring that the children of the European institutions’ staff who are required to live and work abroad in a different cultural environment from their own have access to education in their mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first European School was founded in Luxembourg as long ago as 1953 at the instigation of a group of officials. As this form of teaching was considered successful, 14 European Schools were founded in various Member States over the years. Although I recognise that the European Schools system is a necessity rather than a luxury, it is clear that, more than 50 years on from the founding of the first European School, the system may include some obsolete aspects and, in any case, needs to be brought into line with and adapted to the economic and social requirements of today.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Cavada’s report, which calls for greater involvement by the European Union to support and coordinate the actions of the Member States, which are expected to work towards developing and improving the European Schools system. As we know, investing in education means investing in the future of our young Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, … the report on the absorption of EU funds because we need to have an objective analysis of both the problems and the definite successes from the current programming period. The lessons learnt from this will therefore play a key role in drawing up a more effective cohesion policy in the future. The problems facing Member States at the moment with regard to regulation, eligibility, public procurement, and incompatibility between EU and national requirements, compounded by excessive, inefficient control and a severe lack of the necessary technical assistance, especially in new Member States, have the immediate effect of putting beneficiaries off.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to increase the absorption rate, cut down on the errors, encourage private sector involvement and boost efficiency, we need, first and foremost, to simplify current regulations and procedures. We need a common set of rules for using EU funds which are applicable to all Member States, so as to remove the excessive red tape imposed at national level. We must also ensure that local and regional authorities will be actively involved in the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what clearly emerges from this report is that many European regions find it difficult to administer the Structural Funds made available by the Union through its cohesion policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">They often find themselves caught in a maze in which, if the regions succeed in organising the administration of these funds, it is often the national governments that then find it difficult to activate the cofinancing funds. Sometimes it is like a dog chasing its own tail: the money that we consider fundamental for growth and cohesion in Europe cannot then be spent, as it now appears is happening in my own country, Italy, as well.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have therefore voted in favour of this report, but I believe that, on the one hand, we should speed up the adoption of the new economic programming period 2014-2020 to enable the individual Member States and regions of Europe to prepare themselves in time and, on the other, that the cofinancing mechanism should perhaps be reviewed. That could be a way forward and so I have voted in favour, but I think a lot more needs to be done to ensure that European funds can actually be spent to benefit the people.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as far as the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are concerned, in the first programming period 2004-2006, disbursements reached a level of 99% in Slovakia, amounting in total to EUR 1.2 billion.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the second programming period from 2007-2013, disbursement had reached the level of 18.5% by the end of June, which, in absolute terms, represents EUR 2.1 billion. At the same time, it is assumed that there will be full disbursement of the revised commitment for 2008, i.e. of the resources that can be disbursed up to the end of this year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Theurer report, but I would nevertheless like to emphasise a couple of points. Many EU States do not absorb the European structural policy funds. They cannot absorb them because they lack the expertise needed to use them and because they themselves are unable to pay the small cofinancing amounts. Of course, the European response must now be to send European teams of experts to Greece, and perhaps to Romania, too. However, I also believe that in future, we must tailor the programmes more closely to the most important needs of the weaker countries. Furthermore, large parts of the Europe 2020 strategy simply fail to meet the needs of the less development regions. They are too ambitious and too complex. Therefore, we must, in future, take more action to improve the expertise in these regions and we should not treat them like developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, it needs to be much easier to use private funds for the cofinancing of projects. That is also something for which we need greater flexibility in the next programming period.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the report. I would like to make three additional comments. I, too, am of the opinion that we must, of course, monitor the programmes according to the objective criteria, but that when setting out the objective criteria, we must ensure that the criteria are not too ambitious, that they, quite simply, are possible for the countries to implement, and that the bureaucracy associated with the monitoring is also tolerable and feasible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that cohesion funding should always be provided according to the principle of ‘helping people to help themselves’; that is to say, we should not forget to carry out an evaluation of the objective criteria and to check whether the objectives that were intended to be achieved with the money have actually been achieved. After all, cohesion is intended to have a beginning and an end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, cohesion and structural funds are very much a sign of European solidarity, so it is important that this funding is properly used and used in the best possible way. But, as this report points out, there are huge problems in relation to Member States accessing this funding and coming up with the necessary cofinancing that is required.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the problems this creates is in the public mindset. When we hear announcements of major funding being made available from the European Union budget and the public read these stories, later to read that some of this funding has not been accessed, there is a delay in getting access to it, or they themselves have problems in trying to access funding, that creates a negative attitude towards the European Union. We do need to make these funds work for the betterment of citizens and therefore, the recommendations of this report should be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted for this report because I believe it is an excellent piece of work. What Mr Theurer has produced is an assessment that will certainly also be useful for the imminent legislative work that the Committee on Regional Development is about to tackle in relation to the new funding regulations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problems that have been revealed are many and varied, just as the individual Member States’ absorption capacities are varied – as the rapporteur points out – because each one performs differently regarding the volume of spending and, hence, its efficiency and effectiveness. Out of all the problems highlighted in this report, I think the two that we ought to focus our attention on most are, first, the programming periods, as Mr Antoniozzi has already mentioned, and secondly, the issue of control, insofar as control requirements lead the Member States to focus more on the procedures than on the objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should, however, concentrate on the objectives in order to perform effectively and efficiently. To that end, I reiterate the proposal that I make to this House on every possible occasion, which concerns the possibility of replacing contributions with taxation. I believe that tax exemptions could help to reduce the number of control regulations without going against the Treaty requirements, and could focus attention more on fulfilling the objectives and achieving results.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because it mentions specific problems that are faced when implementing projects financed by the Cohesion Fund, and indicates means of addressing those problems.</p>
      <p sl="lt">First of all, we have the complicated rules surrounding the application of financial instruments and the need to simplify them, taking into account the specific characteristics of each Member State. Secondly, there is a need for greater synergy and complementarity between all the funds (the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) and flexibility. This is required to facilitate the financing of integrated projects. For example, the potential of cross-financing, which is not yet being fully exploited. Thirdly, the Commission and the Member States must give priority to the integrated approach for local and regional development projects, encouraging the development of bottom-up local initiatives, and must also ensure that there is an opportunity to finance as many small and individual projects as possible.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I hope that this time, the European Parliament’s opinion will be heard, and that its proposals will be taken into account, thus promoting more rapid absorption of Cohesion Funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported this report, but there are two issues I would like to draw attention to. First of all, there are the over-complicated and over-strict procedures that are often involved. I have community and voluntary groups coming to me all the time, talking about the complexity and also the inconsistency of the rules – then the changes in the rules and, furthermore, the interpretation of the changes in the rules. People are tearing their hair out with frustration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue that a lot of community groups have a problem with is late payments. I know many community groups that are going to the wall because they are awaiting payments from European funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is another very important issue that we need to look at, and that is the issue of intermediate regions. When we are determining eligibility, it is important that we use the most up-to-date figures. It looks as if we might end up using 2008 GDP figures to determine eligibility for cohesion funding post 2013. That is simply not acceptable in the current situation. Up to now, a lot of regions’ GDP was increasing but, of course, now, because of the economic crisis, a number of regions’ GDP is decreasing and we will find that in 2010 and 2011, it will be lower than it was in 2007 and 2008. So, it is crucial that we use the most up-to-date figures to ensure that the regions that need cohesion funding are those that get it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the dramatic increase in natural disasters both inside and outside the European Union, we increasingly often have to intervene and guarantee a rapid and effective response, as provided for by the new legal basis introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">We should, however, be able to concentrate on pre-identification of the assets available in the Member States that are placed at the disposal of the European Civil Protection Mechanism on a voluntary basis. This would be a significant move away from the current ad hoc response to disasters towards advance planning through the development of reference scenarios, mapping of Member States’ assets and contingency planning.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore advocate greater simplification of the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which so far has proved to be too bureaucratic, and support the creation of a 24/7 European emergency response centre which, in agreement with the Member States, would make decisions on the assets to be deployed in the event of a disaster in order to ensure immediate and effective assistance to the victims.</p>

      <p sl="it">Ms Gardini’s report is right on the mark in this respect, because it essentially identifies the two fundamental points in the new European civil protection strategy. The first is a thorough prevention plan, which can no longer be just the sum of the national prevention plans, and proper rules concerning prevention procedures. The second is the real, concrete idea of European civil protection, which cannot result from mere coordination but must be based on a genuine network.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to move on from an emergency response requested by a country in relation to a disaster and the subsequent intervention, seen almost as a concession by another country, to a genuine strategy. With this hope in mind, I think the resolution adopted today is a useful one for the people of Europe.</p>

However, in reality, I do not think that this is the most important thing. The most important thing is that if we want to build Europe, we must do great things together. We must make Europeans proud of their Union. The fact that Europeans have done great things together in the present or the past will mean that they will be prepared to do even greater things together in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not be mistaken, Europe cannot only be seen by our fellow citizens as an accumulation of legislation, no matter how useful that legislation may be. Europe must have a soul. This European Civil Protection Mechanism that we are going to create will be a part of this soul. It is one of the tools which can create this European soul.

      <p sl="it">Last year, in the Committee on Development, I followed the work on the report on the European Union’s disaster response capacity, which revealed just how much still needed to be done to guarantee a coordinated EU response in view of the increase in earthquakes, floods and tsunamis. The EU’s response to the earthquake in Haiti, for example, clearly illustrated the complexity of the existing instruments and procedures.</p>

In the case of humanitarian assistance in particular, this means even closer cooperation with the non-governmental organisations that are often present in a disaster location. In the rapid and common response to a crisis, logistics are a particularly acute problem where I would welcome concrete proposals for improvement. I also see a solution in the interlinking of existing monitoring centres and the mapping of Member State capacities for individual types of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At the same time, I firmly believe that greater coordination on the part of the EU does not have to ‘compete’ with the global coordinating role of the UN, but, on the contrary, should support it. The responsibility of the Member States should also be emphasised, particularly in external humanitarian assistance. I therefore consider it important for European emergency response capacities to be led exclusively by the contributing Member State or the affected state for now, and not by a European emergency response centre.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European framework is a good idea, but I would like to focus on two issues. There is no sea or coastal tourism, we might say, but a coastal planning policy. I think the time has come for Europe to protect this important sector by producing an initiative in which ideas about the sea and coastline are not limited to a kind of town planning that ends at the foreshore and does not involve the sea as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it will be useful to have an integrated policy on this, just as there will be a need to develop everything that lies behind the claims about rural tourism: rural tourism can be an excellent source of income for disadvantaged areas and areas where there is no work any more, where it is important to stop depopulation and instead encourage people to settle.</p>
      <p sl="it">For that, it is not enough just to make claims. We would need to suggest that Europe and the Member States take action on taxation.

This is an approach to be valued and rewarded, given that the sector in question – with its implications in terms of the percentage of GDP produced, employment and new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, and emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement – is in a position to develop and thus to respond to the major challenges of today.</p>

I, myself, was in Rome during the summer and it was clear why tourists were coming there on holiday. In other parts of Europe, however, especially in the North, they do not have the same advantages.

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, we must understand that 38 000 people are killed annually as a result of road accidents in the European Union. This figure is terrible and it appears to me that it is extremely important to reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and to improve safety on our roads.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We, as Europeans, must work together to reduce the number of deaths on our roads. We must admit that we have a huge problem in relation to the amount of drivers that use text messaging while driving on the roads of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The possibility of an accident increases twenty-three times when the driver watches the screen of his mobile phone. I am extremely grateful to my colleague, Mr Dieter-Lebrecht Koch, for the great work he has done and for presenting this report to us.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We want to protect road users, if there is the political will to do so, and I firmly believe that there is, because this report shows, for example, that we will be able to improve road safety.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted overall in favour of Mr Koch’s report because I agree with its targeted approach inasmuch as it asks the Commission for a concrete, circumstantiated commitment to road safety, including the development of the proposed models into a fully-fledged new action plan.</p>
      <p sl="it">The plan must incorporate a set of detailed measures, with clear timetables and monitoring instruments to assess the progress made, as well as a mid-term review. Conversely, I did not wish to support the idea of appointing an EU road safety coordinator, which, in my view, would be likely to duplicate powers and generate an excessively bureaucratic mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, it seems obvious that achieving the target of halving road accident victims by 2020 would also require a financial commitment that currently appears to be difficult to achieve. In conclusion, however, I regret the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not bold or ambitious enough to accept a complete harmonisation of important road safety rules, such as standardising the EU direction of travel in the United Kingdom and Malta as well, as I proposed in an amendment which the committee chose not to accept.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, I think that we do need to come up with targets and measures that are far more ambitious than those put forward by the Commission thus far; above all, I think that Parliament ought to make its presence felt to the Commission. We cannot accept the fact that in recent years, the European Union’s budget for road safety measures has been slashed. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that this trend is reversed as soon as possible and that road safety receives greater funding.</p>

The Member States, but also the responsible parties at regional and municipal level, businesses and every individual road user are involved in many individual activities and measures. In order to recognise both positive and negative synergies, we need coordination of the activities of the Directorates-General for Transport, Economic and Financial Affairs, the Environment, Health and Consumers, Communication and the Internal Market and Services. Coordination of this kind helps to spread knowledge, and bring about the application, of the best experience, the latest technology and innovative approaches. The Member States will evaluate the experiences gained and then draw the best conclusions. This applies to speed limits just as it does to alcolocks, sight tests, tests on fitness to drive and to the transport of infants. Such decisions should be left to the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a very positive report. It is interesting that we are debating it following the protests over the weekend by European Union motorcyclists. Many came out in protest – certainly in Ireland and in other Member States – over what we would describe as positive initiatives regarding road safety for that particular sector of the commuting community.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is interesting to note that, in Ireland, a motorcyclist is 12 times more likely to be killed than any other road user. There is clearly a problem in relation to the safety of this section of road users. I think we should try to work better with stakeholders, so that we do not have protests over something which we believe is important for overall road safety. Some of the issues that were raised by the protestors may not be true, but we can address others when we move forward. Let us involve those that we are trying to legislate for.</p>

      <p sl="ga">One is that right across the European Union, when it comes to speed limits, there is a complete variance from country to country. There should be coordination whereby the same quality of road, on the same motorway, would have the same speed limit right across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, I find it very difficult to understand how there is no tapering system. I have seen places where you are expected to go from a 120 mile limit or a 120 kilometre limit to 60 automatically. I have seen people pulled over for going over the speed limit just inside the 60 sign. I think there should be a tapering system where you go from 100 to 90, to 80, to 70, to 60.</p>

More than 35 000 people die every year on Europe’s roads, and 1.5 million are seriously injured. I therefore support this own-initiative report, and I call on the Commission to submit specific legislative proposals in this area as soon as possible. We should aim to improve safety on Europe's secondary roads, where, on average, more than 70% of accidents take place every year. I also support the rapporteur’s so-called Vision Zero objective, or an end to fatal accidents on Europe’s roads. If we cannot prevent accidents from happening, we should at least prevent them from being fatal. Vision Zero applies in both air and rail transport, and I therefore fully support implementing this target in road transport as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just three small points I should like to make, all centred on the fact that we need ‘more Europe’ in this area. I think it is an inescapable fact that on certain issues, we must not merely hope for more Europe, but actually set about building it.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, more Europe means starting to really think about common traffic police and uniform safety rules. More Europe means having a European policy on training, not simply delegating it to the individual Member States, but instead putting together a proper training policy for schools, for young people and for slightly more at-risk categories, among whom motorcyclists were mentioned a moment ago, but we could talk about lorry drivers as well.</p>
      <p sl="it">More Europe means everyone having the same devices in their cars to improve safety conditions, such as alcolocks and anti-tiredness devices. This, in my view, would be a strategy well worth pursuing with businesses in the sector and European carmakers. Indeed, if all this was incorporated in a common policy, then I really think that conditions would, perhaps, improve.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report looks at global food security. This means that what is at stake here is not only hunger in the world or in the very poorest countries, but that the subject of food supply affects all communities, including those in the most developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to pick out a few key points of consistency between European policies and this target of global food security, because we in Parliament are quite accomplished at preaching, but often we are not consistent in our decisions. I only wish to highlight three innovative areas, which I think we ought to develop further.</p>
      <p sl="it">Firstly: food supply is currently jeopardised by price volatility, caused by speculation in food markets – through derivatives and so forth – that must be contained, if not banned outright.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly: the subject of land grabbing, which I think needs to be addressed in some form of treaty or negotiation, because democracy and the survival of many populations are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thirdly: consistency between food supply and energy policies. In our efforts to produce new energy, we must not make it impossible to produce food for the people of the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that there were 925 million hungry people in the world in 2010. This is a terrible figure. While this represents a reduction of 1 023 million on the 2009 figure, there is strong evidence that food price increases during the last few months have already augmented that number for this year. Meanwhile, in Europe, about 89 million tonnes of food is wasted every year. That is 179 kg per person. Without any prevention measures, it is expected that the total amount of wasted food will reach 126 million tonnes by the end of this decade. Our colossal wastage of food represents an inefficient use and management of our food resources. Successful commitments to fight poverty and hunger worldwide must begin by addressing our terrible wastage of food. Our right to food must be accompanied by a duty not to waste food.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would say that I disagree totally with paragraph 63 of the report which calls for a complete phasing out of export subsidies. This flies in the face of the rapporteur’s arguments that she wants local production for local use.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support a lot of what is in this report on global food security. I think it is very important to remember that, as technology and innovation leap forward, we sometimes lose sight of the basics. Of course, one of the basics that we need to remember is our need for food or food security, not just in developing countries but in the EU as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that we face at a global level is the financial speculation and trade in agricultural commodities. This simply worsens volatility; it means, at the end of the day, that many people go hungry. We also need to ensure greater transparency in the food chain to ensure a fair revenue for farmers. The primary producers are being squeezed; their share of the cake is getting smaller, and that cannot continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final comment – and, I think, a very important one – is that the right to food must always take precedence over energy security. In many countries, but particularly in Africa, food security is being jeopardised by the development of agrofuels. We in the EU often clap ourselves on the back about our alternative energy targets, but we must recognise the price that others may pay for the targets that we set.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as someone who has authored a report on food security and the common agricultural policy and worked hard on this issue for seven years, I very much welcome the renewed emphasis on food security. Those of us who can afford to buy food have taken for granted that there will always be a supply of food. Of course we are targeting those parts of the world where there is real hunger, but there is also hunger within the European Union. We have to tackle it at every significant level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to repeat a point I made in another explanation of vote. We are in a very serious situation, where agricultural productivity is declining because of a lack of focus on research and innovation and on transferring the knowledge gained to farmers on the ground. This is a problem within Europe, but it is a particular problem for the developing world. We need to target research there, and we need to make sure that people get the knowledge gained by research and put it into practice in food production.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today’s vote on food security was very important. I think that political institutions in the developed world that ignore the problems in less-developed regions do so in grave error and show a lack of compassion.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, sometimes I think we in this House miss the point completely. It is important that we assist in food security in developing countries, but it is also important that we actually provide food security for the people that we represent. The National Farmers Union in the United Kingdom has indicated that the United Kingdom will be less than 50% self-sufficient in staple food types by 2026 unless production is increased. We in this House talk endlessly about the increase in world population, the effects of climate change, increase in biofuel demand and the increasing demand for western eating habits, yet we have decreased agricultural output and, due to decoupling, provide no incentive to produce food.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge the Commission and Parliament to look at these issues, but I am not hopeful. The recent leak from the Commission in relation to a 7% regulation for set-aside in the new CAP proposals will only restrict food production further.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is not only a matter of helping developing countries to tackle this issue more effectively. Rather, since the demand for agricultural products is set to increase by more than 70% between now and 2050, the food crisis is a key issue that must be dealt with quickly and decisively. Otherwise, it may become one of the main threats – if not the main threat - to stability, peace and, as we have seen, even democracy.</p>

The effective interlinking of humanitarian and development assistance is beginning to look essential, in the interests of a long-term solution to food security. The international community and all interested parties must show genuine political will to ensure food security and stability, and adopt additional steps aimed at fulfilling their international obligations. In addressing these issues, we must clearly take care that there is no repeat of the disproportionate increase in food prices caused by speculation in food commodities, as happened in 2008. It is also necessary to take measures to limit the competitive threat to food production from so-called agri-foods and agrofuels.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, global trade has genuinely increased over recent years thanks to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and numerous multilateral and bilateral initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, although the European Union accounted for 25% of global GDP when the Lisbon strategy was adopted in the year 2000, it is now estimated that it will account for no more than 18% in 2020. At the same time, an ever increasing number of developing countries and emerging economies have become involved in world trade and developed into the new engines of the world economy. This was particularly evident during the 2008-2009 crisis, when it was, above all, the emerging economies that played a stabilising role at a time of widespread financial turmoil.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union cannot ignore the fact that the pattern of population growth is being reversed in the EU. The population of developing countries continues to increase rapidly and this will also have repercussions for their economies.</p>

The EU imports are worth around EUR 7 million of Palestinian goods, of which 72% consists of agricultural products. We, Members of the European Parliament, can therefore expect that the agreement will have a substantial impact on the Palestinian economy. However, we should also think about other ways to increase our bilateral trade, especially by improving the conditions for market access of Palestinian exports to the EU, which would certainly be beneficial to all parties concerned.

Since, in recent years, the Palestinian territories have become a place of increasing discrimination and violence against Palestinian Christians, I think that any EU aid for the Palestinian economy could only be acceptable if it was tied to an unbending conditionality mechanism that makes the aid subject to proper protection for the rights of the Christian minority.</p>

In return, some products from the EU will have customs-free access to the Palestinian market, but an upper limit will be set on imports of these products.

I therefore accept the unequal terms.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Since European citizens want to know the origin of the products they consume, it is essential to ensure in this context that the application of the agreement does not lead to abuse of the rules on product country of origin. The European Court of Justice, in its decisions, considers the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to be Palestinian territory; in other words, Israel cannot market the products of Israeli settlements in this area as Israeli goods. We surely cannot hope to solve the Palestinian-Israeli issue in this report, as its main aim is to help farmers and fishermen to export and sell products within the law.

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation concerns an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and aims to provide further liberalisation of agricultural products, processed agricultural products, and fish and fishery products, so amending the Euro-Mediterranean Interim Association Agreement on trade and cooperation between the European Community and the Palestine Liberation Organisation for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The purpose of this agreement, concluded in April 2011, is to support the development of the Palestinian economy, which is undergoing a very serious crisis due to poverty and unemployment, through the duty-free export of agricultural and fishery products to the EU. Although the Palestinian Authority is the EU’s smallest trade partner, I am voting for this recommendation aiming to free exports from the Palestinian Territories from the control of Israeli customs, and I hope it will be the first step in building a Palestinian state, whose right to self-determination must be respected by Israel.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The end of the blockade imposed by Israel on Palestine and its people is indispensable to the development of the Palestinian economy. By proposing increased exports of Palestinian products to the EU and facilitating imports to Palestine, this agreement represents, in the current context, a contribution to the achievement of this aim. Nevertheless, the scope of this agreement is severely limited by the specific situation facing those living in the occupied territories today, which is characterised by violent and persistent attacks on the Palestinian people’s most basic rights. Amongst numerous other things, this brutal and illegal occupation leads to countless obstacles for Palestinian exports and imports, not to mention the day-to-day barriers and constraints on the movement of people and goods. This problem urgently needs to be solved, most immediately by supporting the request made to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly by the Palestinian National Authority for recognition of Palestine as a full member of the UN.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The problem of the EU’s economic relations with the State of Israel still persists. In other words, the EU’s unacceptable complacency and connivance with regard to the clear and repeated human rights violations perpetrated by Israel in the occupied territories: these are an insult to the Association Agreement’s own human rights provisions, which we have always said are almost worthless.</p>

The Commission cannot, with the conclusion of this report, ignore the slow torment of the Palestinian people as a result of the Israeli occupation of its territory. This brutal and illegal occupation leads to countless obstacles for Palestinian exports and imports, not to mention the day-to-day barriers and constraints on the movement of people and goods.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although the Commission decreed in 1998 that ‘no settlement in the occupied territories should be regarded as Israeli territory’, it has washed its hands of its obligations, leaving the duty of monitoring any irregularities regarding the origin of products up to the Member States.

The Commission has negotiated an agreement that replaces certain provisions in the existing 13 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and the United Mexican States.

      <p sl="sk">On 19 December 2006, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2027/2006 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde. This agreement, which is applicable for a period of five years and automatically renewable unless terminated by one of the parties, repeals and replaces the first agreement between the EC and the Republic of Cape Verde, which was concluded in 1990. The current protocol expired on 31 August 2011. In order to allow EU vessels to carry out fishing activities pending the completion of the procedures for the conclusion of the protocol, Article 15 of the new protocol provides for it to be applied on a provisional basis as from 1 September 2011. Cape Verde is an archipelagic island state situated in the Eastern Atlantic, 375 miles to the west of Senegal and Mauritania, with around 465 000 inhabitants. It has limited natural resources and fresh water and ranks 121 out of 182 countries in the UN Human Development Index.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Cape Verde is considered as one of the best performing countries in Africa in terms of political, economic and social development. I therefore express my belief that the new protocol will contribute to the strengthening of the capacity of the Republic of Cape Verde to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, will help to maintain continuity in the fishing zones in the western African region, and will bring an additional dimension to the special partnership between the EU and the Republic of Cape Verde.</p>

The conclusion of the protocol by the Council is subject to the prior consent of the European Parliament. Cape Verde can be considered as one of the best performing countries in Africa in terms of political, economic and social development. The fishery resources are not considerable, but they do include commercially important species of migratory fish such as tunas, small pelagic fish, and some demersal fish and lobsters. According to the evaluation report, the impact of the tuna fishing opportunities on sustainability is minimal.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde starting from 1 September 2011 for a duration of three years. The partnership seeks to ensure EU access to Cape Verde’s fertile waters and that this access is carried out in the most sustainable manner. As its fishery resources account for 2% of Cape Verde’s economy, it is reasonable to suggest that EU access to its waters does not encroach on the nation’s means of development. The fact that a 13% increase in funding will be given to Cape Verde attests to the EU’s desire to fuel its partner’s economy in return for the use of its waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to draw attention to a problem which has arisen in my own country. Romania receives funding from the EU to enhance regional development, and fisheries is one sector that benefits from this funding. However, due to the regulations upholding sustainable fishing practices, a large decrease in employment has resulted. It is likewise my recommendation that the jobs of Cape Verdean nationals employed in the fishing industry be protected under this new agreement.</p>

From the point of view of the Republic of Cape Verde, the agreement with the EU is the closest that it has concluded with any trade partner as regards fisheries as, besides the financial compensation aspect, it has already led to an increase in the instruments available to local fishers.

Their proximity in terms of geography and challenges faced contribute to an increasingly close relationship, complementing a future Atlantic dimension to the EU’s integrated maritime policy. With a view to creating a framework of partnership for the development of a sustainable fisheries policy, the protocol provides for an annual contribution of EUR 1 305 000.

Pursuant to Article 100(2) and Article 218(6a) of the TFEU, the Council has asked the Commission to take the necessary measures to establish a framework for cooperation with the US Federal Aviation Administration on civil aviation research and development. I am voting for this recommendation, because I believe it is positive for both regions to pursue common goals as regards designing new systems of air transport that are more environmentally friendly and efficient.

The proposal, which falls within the framework of Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, so it just requires Parliament’s consent.

      <p sl="sk">The introduction of the euro has considerably increased the need for cross-border transportation of cash by road. Within the euro area, banks, the large retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to enter into a contract with the cash-in-transit (‘CIT’) company and to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank (NCB) branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The purpose of the present proposal is to extend the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States to the territory of a Member State that is about to introduce the euro, since there will normally be an increased need for cross-border euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover. The extension of the regulation should be automatic and take effect as from the date when the Council decides to lift the derogation of a Member State from its participation in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The applied measures are appropriate and are necessary in order to facilitate a smooth changeover to the euro. The Regulation (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council applies to the territory of those Member States which have adopted the euro as their single currency. There is a need for transportation of euro cash in the run-up to the euro changeover since the euro banknotes needed for the changeover are usually transported from existing euro area stocks and since euro coins are often fully or partly minted abroad.</p>

In February 2011, the European Commission approved a Green Paper that seeks to lay down a strategic framework for research and innovation funding after 2013.

Given that many countries are still a long way from achieving this goal, increased public and private investment in R&amp;D is particularly important. The EU is currently experiencing an economic, social and environmental crisis, and research, education and innovation are crucial instruments for both economic recovery and job creation.

      <p sl="cs">I firmly believe that the common strategic framework should not be limited to focusing on research-driven or technology-based innovation alone, but that it should support different sources of innovation. Many companies – especially small and medium-sized enterprises – use other sources of innovation such as clients, markets, users and, not least, employees, and that this form of innovation is often of a more practical nature and is focused on solving specific problematic issues related to processes, services or products. Proposed solutions are often found by the employees that are closest to the production process, markets and clients. The EU should therefore strengthen practise-oriented, employee-driven innovation. The funding of collaborative research should have greater thematic flexibility (broader calls) and user-friendly funding arrangements in order to attract outstanding scientists and to respond to the needs of both large consortia and smaller groups. The whole innovation chain from exploratory research to large-scale pilot projects and demonstrations should be covered. I would like, at the same time, to voice scepticism about the effectiveness of utilising the funds for creating research networks of excellence and organising conferences and events, and to call for a strengthening of electronic networking measures for research and innovation and the dissemination of research results via the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that a partnership is needed between research centres, universities, businesses, civil society and public authorities so that research and innovation address the needs of society to the maximum possible extent and to ensure the coherence and convergence of the actions taken by those involved in this process.

      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I believe that efforts need to be made to make the rules for participating in the various research projects simpler, as universities and SMEs do not have the staff and time available to deal with excessively complicated administrative procedures.

Personally, I would like to focus in particular on the vouchers for innovation (and look at testing based on the credit/voucher principle) because they bring companies closer to the issues of technological development and innovation, creating a system in which the various parties – companies, universities, research centres and institutions – actively participate in the creation and implementation of innovative processes. This mechanism could provide innovative businesses with vouchers to spend at research centres or accredited public or private bodies, supporting the development of innovation. The vouchers would not be subject to cost reporting by the beneficiaries because their use would be certified by the centres using them. This would simplify procedures, supporting small and innovative enterprises.

The purpose of this common strategic framework is to group together the already existing funding schemes and programmes for the development of research and innovation. I believe commitment to research and innovation will be key to the Union’s future, to economic recovery, and to competitiveness.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Matias, concerns the Green Paper ‘From challenges to opportunities: towards a common strategic framework for EU research and innovation funding’, for the post-2013 period. Although the European Commission has proposed the merger of all research-related funds – specifically, the Structural Funds – the rapporteur believes they should remain separate, so as to prevent the exacerbation of inequalities between the various Member States. It would also be desirable to double the sum allocated to EU research and innovation programmes from 2014. I voted for this report, since I agree with the rapporteur that keeping the Structural Funds separate enables them to be put to better use, and prevents resources from being diverted into areas with greater capacity for absorption – like cohesion funding – to the detriment of the innovation and technological development that could create sustained employment, and the training that fosters competitiveness by giving workers new skills.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report includes positive aspects, which we value. Some of these are ideas that are relatively consensual, but which need to be put into practice, such as making research and development (R&amp;D) funding more efficient at regional, national and European level. In the face of the clear failure to meet the R&amp;D investment targets of 10 years ago, a new deadline is now being set for us to achieve 3% of gross domestic product invested in R&amp;D: 2020, or rather two decades after this target was set. However, it is easy to see that it will be hard to hit this target, even in 2020, without a profound change in the overall political and macro-economic framework. Many Member States are frankly a long way off that goal and, even worse, are moving further away from it rather than closer to it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the crisis situation we are experiencing, research, education and innovation are key instruments of economic recovery and job creation, as well as of setting out a model for sustainable and inclusive growth – commonplace in speeches but necessary in practice, having been trampled on by existing policies.

      <p sl="sk">Europe’s aggregate investment in research, development and innovation has not been commensurate with its status as the richest region in the world. The total volume of European investment has admittedly risen in recent years, but that fact has not made Europe more cohesive. There are still very substantial inequalities among the Member States, and I therefore believe that the aim must be to move closer to those in a stronger position and intensify cooperation. To that end, cohesion funding must play a complementary role within the common framework while still being treated as a separate entity. The social dimension and impacts of research and innovation also need to be taken into account, and studied, given that we cannot bring effective action to bear when we are not familiar with the societies at which it is aimed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This report is attempting to reorganise the existing schemes and programmes and provide for new schemes with a view to producing a strategy to benefit stakeholders in overall terms. An appropriate level of commitment is particularly important in view of the present economic and social crisis. In today’s Europe, there are many differences. For this reason, I believe that it is important to provide a basis on which to link together the resources available with a view to producing a framework making for coherence in the relationships established between the sources of financing and the nature and scale of the projects.</p>

In Europe, the low level of direct investment during the very early stages in the development of innovative businesses is limiting the pool of high-potential projects. Furthermore, I recently met some managers of SMEs who told me that they would need a research grant just to understand how European documents are put together! The red tape involved in answering calls for projects is discouraging them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There will be no more innovation unless the European Union converts the quality of its research into growth. It is no longer possible to innovate by oneself; the Framework Programmes for Research and Development must offer more effective financing solutions to networks and partnerships.</p>

We should look at the United States, which is launching a ‘Made in USA’ federal programme relating to energy efficiency, robotics, advanced materials, and so on.

This report proposes that the existing schemes and programmes be reorganised with a view to tackling the challenges that Europe is facing.

Although, without doubt, there has been an overall increase in investments in recent years, this did not result in greater cohesion between individual countries; there are still considerable differences. One of the goals of the European Union is that its total investments in research and development reach 3% of GDP by 2020. We must ensure that other Member States can catch up with those better off, and that we follow a path of increasingly strong cooperation. In order for this to actually happen, it is crucial for the Cohesion Funds to supplement the common framework while retaining their independence. Research and innovation are fundamental means of solidifying a sustainable and inclusive growth strategy. I believe it is very important that in the course of preparing for the post-2013 financial period, we should try to establish the next package by collecting proposals from sectoral stakeholders in innovation and research.

      <p sl="lt">Research and development (R&amp;D) is a very important issue for European growth and progress, and efforts to facilitate participation in R&amp;D programmes and to ensure that money is used more efficiently are therefore essential. The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) proposed by the European Commission and set out in the Green Paper is a very important instrument for achieving the goals of the European Research Area (ERA). We should welcome the fact that the Green Paper underlines the complexity of financing R&amp;D and innovations and compatibility with the financial instruments of the cohesion policy, but this programme must also be more focused on the important challenges facing the EU, such as climate change, energy efficiency and the development of green technologies. It is also important for the programme to underline and strengthen regional cooperation, and as for human resources, more attention should be paid to young researchers, involving them more actively, both in calls for proposals and in the project assessment process, as well as finding means of establishing separate instruments aimed at young researchers or groups of them. This would not only increase the competence of young researchers and the attractiveness of EU research programmes, but would also help rejuvenate the human potential of R&amp;D throughout the entire EU. Having studied the Commission’s vision published in the Green Paper, I must draw attention to the fact that there is insufficient emphasis on certain issues. One such issue is that of a ‘two-speed Europe’, because it is clear that the EU-12 lag far behind the older Member States. The new framework should find means of closing the gap and ending the new Member States’ isolation from the most important EU research processes.</p>

There is also a significant proposal to cancel debts for those researchers who are able to achieve particularly important results.

      <p sl="fr">While the priority is to find ways of containing the current crisis in Europe, we must also think of the future and the vital tools that will ensure the return of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Thus, the European Commission has proposed, in the Europe 2020 strategy, that 3% of EU GDP be invested in research and innovation. I can only support this objective, particularly in view of the fact that only six countries, including France, currently dedicate more than 2% of their GDP to these areas. Europe must provide itself with the means to meet the 3% target. I am delighted to see that the Commission has put forward ambitious proposals to that end. The news that EUR 80 billion will be dedicated to research in the next multiannual financial framework is particularly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it is essential that the forthcoming Common Strategic Framework for Research simplifies its procedures and speeds up the decision-making process in comparison with the current Framework Programme for Research and Development, and that it enables SMEs to participate more. It must also be more consistent with other instruments for investing in innovation, in particular, the Structural Funds, which devote more than EUR 86 billion to innovation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the report on EU research and innovation funding. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to focus on two issues. Firstly, the need to increase the number of women in leading positions in research institutes and in research projects. The format here is always the same: the higher the position in the scientific hierarchy, the lower the number of women involved. I, therefore, support the initiative for universities to appoint at least one female professor to their decision-making bodies, especially the staff appointments committees. Moreover, I am in favour of increased support for female scientists returning to work after maternity leave, as well as those who have to combine work with family life.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I propose that a share of all grants, scholarships and research programmes be offered exclusively to women. Furthermore, I appeal to the Commission to increase the number of female entrepreneurs within the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. I also support the Commission’s initiative aimed at promoting women’s entrepreneurship and the creation of an environment that is conducive to the development of female-led enterprises – the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In my view, the use of multidimensional efforts is vitally important to the development of industry and research. In a time of increasing globalisation, and faced with the current economic crisis, maintaining competitiveness is a great challenge in which scientific research and innovation play a key role.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The funding of scientific research and innovation at national level leads to duplication of procedures. The management of funding at a higher level, the Union level, would result in increased efficiency. The integration and provision of a common financing framework are essential to ensuring the effectiveness of decisions aimed at safeguarding our common future. Ensuring equal opportunities is a major factor in the consolidation of Europe, but is not the only factor. Increased investment, particularly in the case of new Member States, should be one of our fundamental objectives. These States, as mentioned in the report, require significant assistance in order to increase their level of investment to the required 3% of GDP, including investment in both short-term and long-term objectives. It is essential to engage the regions and countries which are not benefiting from the relevant European programmes, and to provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also take note of the social aspect of scientific research and innovation. There is an emerging need for direct communication with the general public through education or the promotion of science in order to encourage and, if you like, awaken European potential. Moreover, the simplification of procedures is essential, for this will not only facilitate participation in programmes, but will also provide further financial opportunities.</p>

I agree with this report when it argues that EU research funding should not be directly related to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and that it is the responsibility of the Commission to develop a multi-fund approach that fosters the creation of synergies among all existing programmes. I am voting for this report, since I consider the doubling of the EU research and innovation programmes’ budget extremely positive, along with the guarantee of greater equality, transparency in the management of funds, increased administrative simplification, and the adoption of the ‘stairways to excellence’ idea. I believe that only the involvement of all actors in creating regional poles of excellence will enable us to achieve a culture of innovation and make the EU more competitive internationally.

      <p sl="el">The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because it harmonises scientific research within the framework of the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy, which views scientific research as a basic pillar subjugated to capital. The report proposes greater funding for ‘centres of excellence’ and funding for the industrial sector. It urges researchers to set up in business and to seek funding, so that scientific research can be used to generate profit for capital. It calls on the EU to create supervision and financing cells for research activities at local and European level. In the capitalist crisis, the research sector is important, on the ground, as part of the strategy of euro-unifying capital to increase its profits and compete with major and emerging imperialist states.</p>
      <p sl="el">The aim of these euro-unifying cells is to invest large amounts in research based solely on the criterion of producing ‘competitive products, technologies and services’ (such as the Galileo satellite programme), via researcher mobility programmes (Marie Curie programme), centres of ‘excellence’ of researchers and institutes, public-private partnerships and grants for undertakings, so that research by universities and research centres can adapt more organically to the strategy of capital.

      <p sl="lt">Research and innovations are important for ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth in Lithuania. Unfortunately, according to data from the European Innovation Scoreboard, Lithuania is well below the EU-27 average – Lithuania’s Summary Innovation Index is 0.23%, whereas the EU-27 average is 0.52%. This is partly down to inadequate funding for research and development and the lack of an innovation-friendly environment in Lithuania. As the rapporteur observes, we urgently need better coordination of research projects and cofinancing within the Union. In my country, corporate funding of research and development is less than a quarter of the EU norm, and public funding for research and development is 15% less than the EU figure. Other data from the European Innovation Scoreboard is also worrying: in Lithuania, for example, 39% fewer people work in jobs requiring intensive knowledge than in other EU Member States. Lithuania needs a more attractive and more dynamic research environment. Lithuanian scientists who have obtained their academic degrees at foreign universities rarely return to Lithuanian institutions due to a lack of competitive funding, poor career prospects, complicated administrative procedures and closed hierarchical structures. It should not be this way.

      <p sl="lv">When considering the current situation in the EU Member States, and especially in the euro area, special attention must be paid to sustainable economic development and increasing productivity and global competitiveness. Increasing the practical contribution of innovation and research forms the platform for achieving this goal. This is precisely why the EU must secure a much larger budget for research projects and a strategically better thought-out and simplified mechanism for delivering it. We must also look after small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the leading players in the EU’s industry and business environment, by ensuring that they can play a more active and better-informed role in innovation projects.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The Matias report on the Green Paper ‘From challenges to opportunities: towards a common strategic framework for EU research and innovation funding’ quite rightly supports the Commission’s proposals to create a Common Strategic Framework for funding in research and innovation after 2013, combining the existing European programmes – namely, the Research Framework Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and the European Institute of Technology – with the structural/cohesion funding allocated for research and innovation.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur’s position that these schools are a necessity and not a luxury. In the face of the financial crisis, the question of budget cuts is becoming increasingly relevant, but when discussing the European Schools, we must analyse the situation by thinking more about the future of young Europeans than costs. Savings should not weaken the fundamental principles on which the European Schools system is based, i.e. that teachers in these schools should continue to provide education in their mother tongue.

      <p sl="sk">The first European school was founded in Luxembourg in October 1953 and this educational experiment, which brought together children with different mother tongues, was speedily judged to be successful. The educational organisation of the European Schools requires basic teaching in the pupil’s mother tongue. Each school has several language sections, in which the breakdown and content of courses are the same and, in order to encourage genuine multicultural education, stress is placed on the use of foreign languages. The European Schools were set up to ensure that the children of the European institutions’ staff who are required to live and work abroad in a different cultural environment have access to education in their mother tongue so these children can be reintegrated into a school in their country of origin at any time. Over 50 years after the creation of the first European School, it is clear that the concept must change and adapt to new economic and social requirements. It must nevertheless remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, in developing European citizenship and encouraging mobility.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The evaluation of the running of the European Schools is positive and this system opens up stimulating prospects for providing a framework for a European educational system.

The European Schools’ syllabus must be made more compatible with national education systems in order to facilitate the swift reintegration of pupils returning to their countries of origin.

More than 50 years after the creation of the first European School, the added value of this project is well proven. Children leaving these institutions are not only multilingual; they are also open to other cultures and equipped to pursue studies in line with their aspirations in an increasingly interdependent and globalised world. Countries which do not provide teachers, who are essential for the proper functioning of these schools, should be aware that they are penalising the children of their citizens.

In Lithuania, the school drop-out rate is now 8.1%, whereas in 2008 it was 7.4%. Even more worrying is the huge gap between urban and rural areas (3.7% and 15.7% respectively) and boys and girls (9.9% and 6.2%). The main reasons for such regional differences are the inadequate school network, undeveloped infrastructure for supporting education and insufficient qualified and competent teachers. In order to address these issues, it is absolutely essential for Lithuania to take a few specific actions. Firstly, the infrastructure supporting training and education must be adapted to socially vulnerable groups. Secondly, we must reduce regional differences in the quality of pre-school and primary education.

Quite a few higher educational establishments already offer courses where tuition is conducted in a foreign language. Some of these establishments are even running certain courses (specialising in advanced philological studies) which can only be followed by students with a sufficient command of a foreign language.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to simplify the rules and procedures on the implementation of financial instruments at both EU and national level and to make them more flexible in order to facilitate access to EU funds for project organisers and to promote sound management of those funds by the administrative services, without creating major difficulties for the beneficiaries.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In connection with the future form of the Cohesion Policy, attention should be focused, among other things, on public-private partnerships (PPP) at regional and local level which, due to their flexibility, might resolve difficulties over cofinancing. The Commission must verify the existence and examine the efficiency of the legislative bases for the implementation of PPP projects and, where appropriate, recommend to those Member States which have not adopted such legislative measures that they prepare and adopt as soon as possible, with a view to permitting the mobilisation of resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for PPP projects in the next programming period, procedures for efficient implementation of these projects at regional and local level. I am concerned that most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot themselves access resources from the Structural Funds due to the current bureaucratic and financial constraints, and that they therefore need support and advice from their representative organisations. A simplification of the rules and procedures is essential to ensuring the access of SMEs to Structural Funds. The initiative in support of SMEs, the Small Business Act, and its ‘think small first’ and ‘only once’ principles, together with the proportionality principle, should be applied at all levels of decision making to define investment priorities and the design of management, audit and control procedures in order to ensure better absorption of the funds.</p>

The inability to absorb funds is exacerbated at present in light of the economic crisis and austerity policies chosen to address it. The report makes a number of correct assumptions about the importance of absorption of structural and cohesion funds by the EU regions and identifies several of the problems with the procedure. I abstained, because the report suggests the method of ‘public-private partnerships’ as the solution in terms of increasing absorption and proposes that national legislation should be amended in order to improve and simplify its adoption, with a view to further facilitating such partnerships. Experience to date has shown that PPPs, at both regional and local level, serve private profit; they do not maximise social benefits. The cost of implementing them is demonstrably higher, they are less efficient economically and their standard is low. Finally, the benefits are not channelled directly to local economies and communities; on the contrary, they create additional nuisance and charges.</p>

All this has to take place within the context of the broad and effective involvement of all the institutional, economic and social partnerships at the various local levels in order to identify the strategies and specific and operational objectives to be pursued. In addition to this, there needs to be effective programming and unified implementation by the different EU (structural, agricultural and neighbourhood policy funds) and national funds, recognising in project funding the capacity for integration of the various areas and production and the different private and public entities, including in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional context.

The principle underlying the uses to which structural funding is put is improving the lives of the public. However, the Member States have encountered many problems putting it to use. From delays with the transfer of funds – obliging institutions to turn to banks, whose interest is not covered, to cover their commitments to companies – to excessive bureaucracy, with complex, incoherent procedures, rule changes, etc., and insufficient funds to cover the national contribution, the process is made more difficult. The EU should support those countries that do not manage to absorb the sums set aside for them owing to a lack of knowledge by sending a team of experts.

      <p sl="sk">Since the late 1990s, absorption of structural and cohesion funds has been recognised as a principal concern in relation to the implementation of the EU cohesion policy. Many Member States have faced difficulties in absorbing the structural and cohesion funds from the EU budget during the early post-accession years, especially shortly following accession, which resulted mainly from the global economic recession. The consequences included problems in terms of the delivery of projects, changes in expected demands and growing restrictions in national or local public financing. It became even more difficult to obtain sufficient resources to cofinance projects. Further problems were caused by delays with the establishment and introduction of EU and national rules, or with related guidance and gaps in the rules, or rules which were not clear. I believe that some regulatory requirements should be further adapted to take account of implementation experience. The rules relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds are often complex.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For this reason, they are difficult to comply with, causing errors. Member States therefore spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to manage and control these errors. It is my view that rules and procedures should be simplified in order to reach higher absorption rates, reduce errors and increase efficiency. At the same time, a right balance should be found between simplification and stability of rules and procedures. Finally, multi-level governance and the partnership principle play an important role in the management of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</p>

It has not escaped the rapporteur’s notice that one of the reasons for this under-use was that these funds can only be cofinanced: the Union is all generosity with other people’s money. Some other local authority, or the State, has to put their hands in their pocket to access partial funding from Brussels, which, in current times of tight budgetary control, is becoming increasingly complicated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another reason is the complicated award and control procedures. These are massively time consuming, involve reams of paperwork, take up hours of time of those on the public payroll, and are therefore a massive financial burden on States. However, the question of how relevant these funds are is not raised, nor whether finding national or local projects which can offer access to Structural Funds caused a few headaches, nor whether those projects that actually received funding were of limited use in relation to the objectives set out and, in particular, to what the regions actually need.

The prompt provision of clear instructions and guidelines by the European Commission to the managing authorities on how to apply European legislation is an important condition for reducing the risks of errors and delay. Striking the balance between ensuring legality and transparency and the need to achieve greater effectiveness is of key importance to fulfilling the cohesion policy’s objectives.

There should be a stronger focus on punishing fraud rather than formal irregularities; I believe there should be a more flexible approach that takes into account the seriousness of the irregularity identified. Application of the proportionality principle, under which control procedures are determined by the scale of the project, should be strengthened by simplifying the requirements governing the supply of information and monitoring when implementing small-scale projects and programmes, but simplified rules must not in any way have a negative impact on transparency and responsibility. Efforts need to be concentrated on a limited number of priorities – the most urgent being to reduce record levels of unemployment in the internal market, with special reference to jobs for young people and women – in order to ensure that EU-wide projects are implemented more efficiently and that the impact and potential of the ESF are maximised, thus supporting the Europe 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="fr">For the 2007-2013 period, the cohesion policy has EUR 347 billion, in other words, 35.7% of the EU budget. These funds account for 25% of public investment in Europe and are essential for ensuring economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. However, numerous delays are blamed for their uptake. For example, Greece, which could benefit from a total of EUR 20.3 billion, has only used 4.9 billion as of mid-2011, and has another 15.4 billion to spend by 2013. That takes the biscuit, at a time when that country is going through one of the most serious budgetary crises seen in Europe for decades. The reasons for these delays are clearly set out in this report: slow implementation of new management systems, global economic recession, public finances in crisis, highly complicated rules, procedures changed during programming, a lack of qualified staff, inadequate project preparation …</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are solutions to improve take-up of these funds: we just need to have the courage to apply them. We need to be brave and make reforms, simplify procedures, empower and support those involved. The cohesion policy will be legitimate and help heal the crisis if, and only if, these funds are actually taken up.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting the report on future EU cohesion policy. I insist that it is imperative to simplify EU and national regulations and procedures for obtaining funding and to make the former more flexible. The current degree of complexity of the management programme does not provide for efficient control over expenditure. In particular, I would like to draw attention to the need to provide permanent, free and easy access to information, advice and training for the beneficiaries of the EU funding. I support the proposal to develop a common EU programme of information exchange between regions with a high level of absorption of the funds and regions with a low level of absorption, to facilitate dissemination of practices proved through experience. I also support the idea of creating an Internet platform for the exchange of good practice to be used by the beneficiaries, local and regional entities and authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also essential that future funds, especially the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Social Fund, take into account the current socio-economic challenges, in particular, the economic crisis. The Member States should provide better information on the resources available through the funds and simplify national procedures for gaining access to those. With this in mind, I am in favour of creating something like ‘European One-Stop Shops’ whose purpose would be to assist in preparing applications to obtain financing through the funds and which would service both local authorities and the citizens of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The absorption of structural funding is a major concern in the implementation of cohesion policy, and there is a need to analyse the problems the Member States are experiencing in making effective use of funding, in order to learn lessons for the future. The Committee on Regional Development, of which I am a member, has approved a series of proposals based on analysis of the underlying reasons for absorption problems, such as initial problems at the start of a programming period; financial problems resulting from the crisis; new regulatory, organisational and control requirements; the issue of insufficiently qualified human resources; and the problem of delays with information technology systems. The proposals tabled in the document adopted today by Parliament stress the need to simplify rules and procedures, and to focus on payments that produce results, on greater balance between rules and procedures, and on cohesion policy that is more geared towards performance and is more efficient. However, they do not forget the significant differences in absorption capacity among Member States, and suggest the creation of an exchange programme for good practices, whilst stressing the importance of multi-level governance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that I voted in favour of Mr Theurer’s report. The question of how, in future, we can further increase the absorption rates in cohesion policy is of major importance to our regions. The difficult situation for public finances, which does not always lend itself to cofinancing, is evident. We could provide assistance in this connection through more flexible cofinancing, although it would, of course, be necessary to ensure in such a situation that this was not abused. The basic problem, however – namely, the difficult financial situation – is not so easy to change. What we, the legislators, really do have in our gift, though, is the matter of how quickly we can implement the new regulations so that the onset of the new subsidy period does not replicate the cumbersome arrangements of the early days of 2007. The report makes clear that late decision making was a major cause of the delays. We must thus take responsibility and ensure, together with the Member States, that this time we get everything under way more quickly. Of course, that also means that the Member States need to agree on the EU budget quickly, as without such an agreement in respect of the multiannual financial framework, we will also not be able to agree on the details of the new structural fund period.</p>

Last year, there were a number of very severe disasters in Europe and throughout the world, including flash and large-scale floods, heavy storms and forest fires, causing a high number of deaths and huge damage. I am talking about the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, the earthquake in Haiti and the Pakistan floods. Given the recent dramatic increase in natural and man-made disasters both inside and outside the European Union, the EU must aim to make existing instruments work more efficiently at all stages of the European disaster management cycle. Here, I have in mind prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, as well as optimising the use of all resources. It is also very important to simplify the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which is too bureaucratic. However, the most important thing is for all Member States to contribute to the European disaster response in the spirit of European solidarity. The use of resources available in Member States should be optimised, avoiding duplication of structures, efforts or expenses, and unnecessary or even disruptive bureaucracy.</p>

The Commission should explore the possibility of equipping the EU with a dedicated and secure telecommunications capacity and integrated crisis management solutions ranging from prevention to recovery. In my opinion, there is considerable potential in the use of the existing capacity provided by telecommunications satellites in order to facilitate the development of services for citizens in the fields of public security and emergency response, in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Member States and stakeholders such as private operators and industry. The Commission’s role is to develop a communication and information network, exploring, in particular, the use of telecommunications capacity, including satellites, in order to give rescue teams access to rapid and detailed information facilitating effective disaster relief.

I dispute that it would be better to combine resources to provide both civilian protection and immediate emergency aid in times of crisis and view such efforts by the EU as attempting to commandeer crisis management, which, based upon the situation in the eurozone, is not their strength. Most concerning is the statement that the Commission calls for the need for better coordination among all actors to avoid overlapping and duplication of efforts both on the political and on the operational side – which each should function autonomously in order not to impede the rapid and effective help for the victims of the disaster. This implies that independent charities and nation states will be overruled by the EU who would have final say in how the crisis is managed, under the EU banner, both at home and abroad. Voluntary efforts of Member States should be a priority and thus, the Union does not need a 24/7 emergency response centre as a planning and operational coordination platform.</p>

Firstly, the provision to activate the ‘solidarity clause’, as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, allows terms such as terrorism and man-made disaster to be interpreted subjectively. Furthermore, the report makes provision for the use of military means under civil protection in order to address disasters, again without carefully clarifying the type of disaster.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Gardini, concerns the need to reinforce Europe’s capability in disaster situations, particularly as regards civil protection and humanitarian assistance. In recent times, we have witnessed a great increase in the number of disasters, such as those in Haiti and Japan. In Europe, we have had fires on a large scale, the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano, and landslides and floods resulting from heavy rains. Indeed, in the last 20 years, the number of disasters has risen fivefold, and resulted in some 100 000 victims. These are large-scale phenomena that require effective and properly coordinated responses. The European Union needs to adopt preventative measures, such as combating climate change, and also play the role of coordinating all the Member States, to which responsibility for this area falls; if not, we will become tangled up in a web of responsibilities that make a quick and effective response more difficult. I welcome the adoption of this report, which focuses on the most vulnerable areas, such as mountain, island and coastal regions, so demonstrating great human and financial concern, and I welcome the creation of a European civil protection force.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Preparation, response and restoration constitute stages in the disaster management cycle on which there could and should be cooperation between Member States, because of both the cross-border nature that disasters can have, and of the complexity, scale and cost of the materials that need to be mobilised when large-scale disasters occur. This cooperation should be based on solidarity and mutual aid, and could also involve resource sharing. Whatever the case, countries’ sovereignty must be respected and there must be no duplication or overlapping of chains of command, which must rest with the competent national or regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Disaster response cannot be a pretext for external intervention, for asserting economic and geostrategic interests, or for military intervention and occupation hidden beneath a cloak of humanitarian intervention. There are already sad examples of this situation and, furthermore, worrying signs that it could be exacerbated in the future. A good example would be the recent changes to the strategic conception of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which have illegitimately and unacceptably expanded this military organisation’s scope for intervention; in other words, war. We do not believe that the framework for disaster response proposed in this report guards against all these issues, which we consider essential.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report does not give enough weight to prevention policies; in other words, those that could prevent, in some cases, or minimise, in others, the effects of disasters. Prevention involves policies on the environment, agriculture, energy, industry, water resources, and the organisation and management of territories. How many forest fires could have been prevented if the common agricultural policy had not contributed to desertification of our inland areas, and to harming our agriculture, our agro-agriculture and our rural life? Europe urgently needs to have more means of funding policies that are actually preventative, and for prevention and warning measures. Increasing Europe’s response capability must involve preservation of the environment, changes to common policies, education and awareness-raising about the environment, increasing each Member State’s capacity for response, and planned cooperation between neighbouring countries, including comprehensive declarations of risk and mechanisms for warning and taking action.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The idea of a special unit for combating forest fires seems neither useful nor feasible. Greater mutual aid and cooperation is possible and desirable. When mention is made of the usefulness of the European Space Policy and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme, there is a danger that security concerns are being given greater emphasis than the environment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Last year, Europe had to face a number of severe natural disasters, including flash and large-scale floods, heavy storms and forest fires, and also the ash cloud following the eruption of an Icelandic volcano. Some very severe disasters occurred outside Europe, too, causing an enormous number of casualties and huge destruction, notably the earthquake in Haiti and the Pakistan floods, and the most damaging oil spill ever in the Gulf of Mexico after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling well. Now the world is struck by the dramatic happenings in Japan, hit by a combination of a strong earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear catastrophe. Disasters within Europe over the past 20 years have killed almost 90 000 people, affected more than 29 million and caused EUR 211 billion in economic losses. Approximately 90% of European citizens expect the EU to do more to help their country when struck by a disaster.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am of the view that the European response needs to be enhanced through pre-identification of the assets available in the Member States that are placed at the disposal of the European Civil Protection Mechanism on a voluntary basis.

      <p sl="fr">The question of European cooperation in matters of civil protection is not even raised and it is obvious that natural disasters, fires, tsunamis and so on have no respect for borders. Over 373 natural disasters were counted worldwide in 2010, resulting in nearly 300 000 victims and affecting 207 million people. These figures are a powerful reminder of the EU’s urgent need to organise itself better to provide a large-scale, rapid and effective operational response. They urgently call for systematic action at European level, both inside and outside the EU (as proposed in the Commission’s communication and approved in our report). The current Community Civil Protection Mechanism is undoubtedly effective, but it is inadequate. I will wholeheartedly support any proposal that goes along these lines to provide greater visibility to European action in matters of civil protection, but also to all voluntary action taken in the service of civil protection. In addition, I even believe that this visibility should involve the creation of a genuine European civil protection force, together with a common logo, a European flag and a common uniform.</p>

A properly coordinated EU civil protection service would not only make it possible to collaborate efficiently when dealing with humanitarian crises, but also to redesign the investment of resources for the sector which are often wasted because of a lack of coordination in emergency response procedures. The intrinsic value of this proposal is to finally redefine the European situation also in its model of response to emergencies caused by natural disasters.

Another observation that has been made over time within the Committee on Regional Development is that European regions situated at the EU’s borders may be affected by disasters occurring in regions located in third countries, thereby making intervention even more difficult. It is therefore crucial that specific measures are developed to support these regions, while also taking into account disasters caused by people or industrial accidents, which require different strategies. Last but not least, the Commission must ensure that, in future, Member States involve their regional and local authorities in disaster response operations right from the outset, based on the multilevel governance model applied in the cohesion policy, through a win-win communication strategy for all the actors involved in the response mechanism.</p>

European institutions can make progress in this field, and that of humanitarian assistance, by shifting from simple coordination towards a predictable and pre-planned system of EU civil protection.

The earthquake that shook Japan in March 2011 is just the latest example. In Europe alone, over the last 20 years, various disasters have killed almost 90 000 people and caused economic losses amounting to EUR 211 billion. Climate change, population growth coupled with urbanisation, industrialisation and environmental damage are all causes that can explain this increase.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with these tragedies, what is Europe doing? Does it take advantage of these events to demonstrate its added value in terms of coordination, pooling of resources and solidarity? Unfortunately not. In 2006, Michel Barnier proposed a certain number of urgent reforms, which we have only begun to discuss seriously today, and which are echoed in the Gardini report. The Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union a legal basis on which to develop its response capability to this type of tragedy. It is now up to the Member States to play along and to pool certain prevention and response resources so that European solidarity is finally visible and effective.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I supported the report entitled ‘Towards a stronger European disaster response: the role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance’. At present, when catastrophes or disasters strike, EU procedure does not provide for adequate and sufficient aid to Member States. Urgent action must be taken to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, coherence and clarity of the procedure. More efficient use of available resources will make it possible to avoid additional financial and administrative procedures, especially as concerns regional and local authorities. A more effective and timely response is a much more economical solution than simply dealing with the effects. Cohesive use of the available funds for this purpose will guarantee effective aid at each level. I refer to human resources and infrastructure. The provision of adequate aid will enable better identification of where resources are lacking and of the specific role played by the EU in the provision of aid to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw your attention to the need to amend the regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund. The criteria for seeking help from this fund must be adapted to the specific nature of individual regions, disasters and calamities. In addition, like in the case of other funds, it is also important to make it possible to mobilise resources in a flexible way and depending on the needs arising.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, we most often cast our mind to problems relating to the lack of good and smoothly operating systems of response to various disasters only after the event. On a number of occasions recently, we have had to deal with tragic natural disasters in Europe and in the rest of the world. Torrential rains are regularly causing floods, and we have experienced storms, forest fires and the eruption of an Icelandic volcano. All these events result in a huge financial cost and paralyse communications. In addition, events outside Europe, in Haiti, Pakistan, Japan, and the explosion of the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico have caused the deaths of thousands of people and had a negative impact on the European economy. In times of crisis, we cannot afford duplication of efforts by several European States, as that means duplication of costs and of the efforts made by entities and agencies responsible for providing a response in each of the Member States. Accordingly, we must work out a cohesive, comprehensive and well-coordinated system for the entire European Union, one that would be not only effective but also rational.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation with third countries and countries that adjoin the EU, for it is with such states that we should seek to cooperate and coordinate actions and the use of resources in a way that would allow most effective use of their potential. We should always keep in mind that various disasters and calamities do not recognise the existence of territorial borders.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Natural disasters occurring within Europe over the past 20 years have killed more than 90 000 people, affected more than 29 million, and caused about EUR 211 billion in economic losses. The purpose of this report, tabled by Parliament, is to serve as a basis for the Commission’s legislative proposal, which will also be tabled this autumn. I therefore support the Commission’s proposal to improve and strengthen the EU’s response capability, through the creation of a European emergency response capacity based on the Member States’ specialised assets, as well as the creation of a European emergency response centre, as a simplification of the current Civil Protection Mechanism. The system’s red tape also needs to be cut, by creating a European civil protection force to coordinate all the actors involved at European, national, regional and local level, so as to speed up processes and avoid the duplication of efforts. I come from Madeira, a region whose situation means it is overly exposed to natural disasters, as was the case with the storm of February 2010, so I support the taking of political, but particularly operational, measures to minimise their effects.</p>

      <p sl="el">The European Parliament’s report and the Commission communication are anything but innocent. The euro-unifying legislative framework of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has already been extended to include action to ‘combat terrorism’. Within that framework, it proposes the establishment of a civil protection force based on an ‘all-hazards approach’ with ‘synergies among the various existing tools and instruments’. It proposes the activation and implementation of the ‘solidarity clause’ introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon and provides the facility for intervention by the EU in the internal political affairs and developments of a Member State, including for the purpose of dealing with risks to public policy and security.</p>
      <p sl="el">The sweet-sounding calls for action to deal with forest fires and other environmental dangers or natural disasters conceal plans to use military means and existing monitoring systems, such as the GMES and Galileo satellite systems. In other words, infrastructures and preconditions are put in place for close coordination and mutual support between military and civil mechanisms, in order to establish an enhanced EU civil protection system with even more militarised features and structures.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In recent years, disasters have increased in number and in gravity. It was important that our Parliament reiterated its call for the creation of a European civil protection force, capable of immediate deployment, inside and outside the Union. The shocking images of the earthquake in Haiti, the floods in Pakistan, the forest fires in southern Europe, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, not to mention Fukushima, shook the planet and underlined the desperate need to optimise European action, at all stages of disaster management. On each occasion, I have supported Parliament’s calls for the Commission to make proposals that move towards a pooling of material and human resources available in Member States and towards improved coordination between them to support a European civil protection force, which unfortunately has been a long time in coming. Each disaster brings its share of human tragedy and destruction. It is therefore essential to support Europe’s capacity to intervene in the areas of prevention, response, recovery and humanitarian action. In this area, we need to ensure that the principle of European solidarity is put into action.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The numerous disasters that have recently affected EU countries and other parts of the world make it imperative to take all measures possible in order to enhance Europe’s capacity to respond to disasters and catastrophes. In my role as Vice-Chair of the Delegation for relations with Japan, I followed the development of the situation in that country with particular attention, after Japan was affected by a major disaster in March of this year. This was brought about by the concurrence of an earthquake, a tsunami and a dangerous failure at a nuclear power station. Being aware of the fact that it is impossible to rule out occurrences of natural disasters or of catastrophes brought about by human beings, it is imperative for us to work out in advance various scenarios based on the use of existing mechanisms and taking into account the previously identified pool of resources. A cohesive strategy incorporating action plans, an integrated monitoring system with access to satellite information, measures to improve the flow of information and coordinated cooperation among Member States will most certainly curtail the damage to the environment, society and the economy in the event of a disaster.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting the present report. It is gratifying that the European Parliament is paying increased attention to the Union’s capacity to provide aid in cases of disasters and catastrophes. It is necessary to emphasise the fact that over the last 30 years, the number of different kinds of disasters recorded the world over, including in Europe, has increased fivefold. This means that we should work out considerably more efficient methods for dealing with the consequences of this growing number of disasters. In my view, while the European Union is allocating more and more resources to this objective, its actual capacity remains far from sufficient. The latter should not be based on the use of resources offered – voluntarily – by individual Member States of the European Union. The Union should be building its own resources at pan-Union level. These would include, for example, a fleet of transport aircraft to be immediately available whenever humanitarian assistance has to be provided following a catastrophe or disaster.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Euro banknotes and coins were introduced in 2002 and are a pan-European means of payment, allowing European citizens to settle their debts in euro throughout the euro area, currently consisting of 17 Member States. The very principle of a single currency implies the freedom to move cash between the participating Member States. However, due to incompatibilities between national legislations, it is, in most cases, very difficult for professional cash transporters to move euro cash between euro area Member States, and very little cross-border land transportation therefore takes place. Regulatory differences concern a wide range of issues, such as the possession and carrying of firearms by the cash-in-transit (CIT) staff, the authorised modes of transport, the armouring and equipping of the CIT vehicles and the number of staff in those vehicles. The current regulatory obstacles imply a fragmentation of the single market in this sector. These constraints on professional euro cash transportation have an impact on the cash cycle and, ultimately, on the cost of cash for firms and citizens. I agreed that it is necessary to take action to remove existing regulatory barriers to cross-border transportation of euro cash by road and thereby facilitate the free circulation of the euro.</p>

The supplement to the regulation takes account of the regime for the control of exports in order to establish a reliable system for the collection, transmission and storage of notifications. A lot of attention is also paid to enhancing the European Union’s reputation, and representation in international regimes for the control of exports should also be improved. The granting of authorisation for the export of dual-use items is decided under four international export control regimes. Firstly, the Australia Group endeavours to prevent the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Secondly, the Nuclear Suppliers Group aims to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons and controls exports. The Missile Technology Control Regime aims to curb the spread of unmanned delivery systems for nuclear weapons, and the Wassenaar Arrangement focuses on the transparency of national export control regimes.

      <p sl="pt">The issue of dual-use items – goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes, such as chemicals that can be used in fertilisers or to prepare bombs and information technology for computers that can also be used to guide missiles – is currently a highly sensitive one. European-level export controls for dual-use items and technologies aim to ensure respect for the international commitments of the EU and its Member States as regards the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. The main function of these international regimes for the control of exports is updating the lists of items subject to control.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To date, these lists have been almost automatically transposed into EU law, without any participation, or with minimal participation, from the European Parliament. I welcome the adoption of a joint interpretation by Parliament and the Commission within the new framework agreement, which will be crucial for a more transparent and democratic organisation of the EU’s dual-use regime.</p>

The purpose of the proposal in question is to create an EU regime for controlling the export of items and technologies of this type, so we cannot fail to prioritise transparency and security, even if the items covered by the proposed amendment of the regulation are destined for countries that, at least initially, do not pose a particular threat.</p>

This is a very sensitive issue, since we are talking about items that can enable the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, thereby compromising the security of goods and people. This process dates to December 2008, when the Commission submitted its first draft amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000, with a view to adding six new annexes. The amendments now being introduced step up the security and control of exports of these dual-use items.

Controlling the export of dual-use goods is a key for the non-proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

Furthermore, sanctions are to be imposed for transporting dual-use items illegally when this takes place in connection with a weapons of mass destruction programme. A database of rejected export authorisations would surely facilitate these controls. In light of experiences with SIS I and SIS II, expectations in this regard should not be set too high.

We need to separate military use from civil use.

      <p sl="lt">Furthermore, Parliament calls on the Commission to draw conclusions from recent emergencies, such as the volcanic eruption, and to draw up specific scenarios for EU crisis management, so that coordination and uniform action in all Member States with regard to information and the measures to be taken become the rule.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would congratulate the Commission on tabling 21 proposed actions and a plan for implementing them, from which the priority actions should be identified and timetabled. The proposal framework for action is based on four pillars. The first of these is to stimulate competitiveness through support for innovation and information and communication technologies, in order to improve professional skills and training, and for greater seasonal flexibility. The second is to promote sustainable, diversified, responsible and high-quality tourism that is available to all. The third is to consolidate the EU’s image at international level, whilst coordinating and simplifying processes for issuing tourist visas, so fostering the attractiveness of our tourist destinations. The final pillar is to maximise the potential of the available policies and financial instruments, thereby contributing to the sector’s competitiveness.</p>

Moreover, as it is essentially made up of small and medium-sized enterprises, the tourism sector is increasing competitiveness and the capacity for sustainable growth, so working towards the priorities set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. I welcome the adoption of the measures advocated in this report as part of establishing a new political framework for the tourism sector, by fostering competitiveness, diversifying what is available, supporting innovation, improving professional skills and extending tourist seasons.

      <p sl="pt">The report includes positive aspects that could help increase business activities in the sector, such as the collation and dissemination of good practices, advocating support for certain specific sectors like environmental and rural tourism, and advocating the diversification of tourism activities, which are likely to make tourism less seasonal. However, we cannot, in fact, ignore the general situation, which currently limits tourism activity: in other words, a profound economic and social crisis, which could be exacerbated in the near future, particularly in countries like Portugal.

      <p sl="sk">Tourism, which is the third leading social and economic activity of the EU, representing 10% of its GDP and constituting 12% of total employment, is a very important sector because, apart from its focus on the integration and development of less developed regions, it can also harmonise growth with moral and sustainable development in EU Member States. In addition to the above, it is an important instrument in the enhancement, dissemination and promotion of our image in the world.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Tourism has always been a part of Community policy making. Since December 2009 in particular, EU institutions have taken a new direction in the implementation of new competences guaranteed by the Lisbon Treaty, which endows the EU with the authority to supplement and to coordinate activities carried out by the Member States in the field of tourism. By means of its communication of June last year, as well as the new priorities set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission wishes to support a coordinated approach and to set a framework of activities aiming at the strengthening of competitiveness and the capacity for sustainable development in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that it is important to follow carefully the measures proposed by the Commission, as well as the proposals presented by the European Parliament, and to monitor their actual performance on a regular basis.

The first is to enhance regional tourist spots, but also intra- and inter-regional tourism. The second, which is equally important, is based on the assumption that Europe is founded on cultural and linguistic diversity and therefore demands that access to tourism sites by as many people as possible is facilitated by different instruments.

From the seaside to the mountains, many regions have their own special trump cards, and these cannot be allowed to disappear beneath an EU policy.

Member States and the EU are faced with the tasks of adopting measures aimed at boosting tourism’s competitiveness globally and of ensuring the sector’s sustainable growth, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. I think that one of the key messages in the report is the need to develop human capital through training and professional development, which would increase significantly the quality of tourism as a product. Given also that a large proportion of businesses operating in the sector are micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, I think that greater support must be provided in introducing and using information and communication technologies and innovations. Another important focus area is the continuation of the actions launched with the Calypso programme, linked with countering the seasonal bias in tourism and providing opportunities for vulnerable population groups to use tourism products.

Today, the whole concept of package travel is outdated and the Commission should make amendments as a matter of urgency so that the same legislation is applicable to all parties offering tourism services. I believe that this also presents an opportunity for a reduced VAT rate on tourism to be progressively harmonised across the Member States as a necessary condition for transparent competition between tourist companies in the EU and non-EU countries. We must enable disadvantaged people, such as the elderly, people with disabilities, young people and low-income families to have easier access to holidays, particularly during the low season and when travelling across national borders, and physical accessibility, adequate services and reliable information therefore need to be further planned for and incorporated into tourism products. The quality of services provided to a consumer and fair competition should be prime factors. There is also a need to promote European business tourism in the EU and throughout the world, given its economic importance for certain places in Europe and the fact that business tourism creates services linked to the organisation of trade fairs, exhibitions, conferences and other business events (hotels, catering, shops, transport, communications and event management agencies, etc.).</p>

No wonder, as tourism is a sector that is capable of positively influencing the economic growth of the EU, stimulating job creation, and contributing to development. Consequently, there is a difference to what efforts we make in order to reinforce European tourism and maintain its competitiveness. In 2008, a total of over 370 million tourists visited the EU Member States, accounting for 40% of the world’s tourist traffic. This makes Europe the number one tourist destination among holidaymakers.

      <p sl="de">In the EU, tourism is not only assuming great significance from an economic point of view, but it also offers an opportunity to improve our image. A few initiatives have been put in place at EU level in relation to tourism. These have dealt, for example, with improving the rights of passengers and making the costs of flight bookings more transparent for travellers. In addition, certification marks have been created, in relation, for instance, to environmental protection or high-value tourism, and a few tourism projects have been funded. What is certain, however, is that today’s tourists rely increasingly on the latest technologies and that a professional Internet presence is essential in tourism. When it comes to the measures proposed by the Commission, there are some questions that still appear to be unresolved. Above all, there has been no clarification with regard to tourist visas and the abuse thereof in the context of data protection in relation to the data collection proposed internally within Europe.

      <p sl="de">The positive figures in the tourism sector show that, despite the difficult economic situation, tourism is assuming a major significance in the EU. Considering that tourism contributes to human enrichment, to exchange, to welfare and wellbeing, to culture and to social cohesion, I take the view that, above all, a quality-based approach must take centre stage. The success of Europe as a tourist destination is based, to a large extent, on the incredible diversity that our continent has to offer. I therefore fail to see why we need a uniform EU brand. What we do need is to boost the competitiveness of the EU’s tourism sector through measures to increase awareness of quality rather than pushing for more mass tourism. The present report states that tourism must not take place at the expense of the environment. I call on the Commission to encourage better planning processes, especially in coastal areas, and to support environmentally friendly transport systems. To my mind, the measures proposed by the Commission will not, in some cases (such as the EU brand) help bring about their desired objective, while in other cases, they do not go far enough. I therefore voted against this report. In addition, I expect the Commission’s planned measures within the tourism strategy to aim to curtail illicit working and rural depopulation and to create jobs that are less susceptible to seasonal ups and downs.</p>

As is comprehensively explained in the report, tourism is a hugely important industry to Europe, particularly in my home country of Ireland. Across Europe, tourism counts for 10% of GDP and 12% of total employment, and hence it is imperative that we put in place a comprehensive plan to develop and improve the industry. In particular, I welcome the report’s call for the publication of good tourism practices each year. This would provide practical advice to the many small and medium-size tourism enterprises that do not have access to the market research of the bigger-scale tourism companies. Moreover, the establishment of a ‘European heritage label’ would, much like UNESCO and other similar brands, help provide a standardisation to tourist attractions, thus improving the experience of those who visit these sights, destinations and experiences.

I voted in favour of the report because, for the first time, it sends a strong message in support of renewing European tourism. We are the world’s number one tourist destination: our continent attracts visitors both because of its history and its heritage. For all its potential, our tourist sector has some deficiencies. First and foremost, there is a lack of harmonised classification criteria for venues, accommodation and restaurants. The lack of transparency often creates confusion among foreign and European tourists alike. Lastly, tourists’ tastes and habits are constantly changing. Providers nowadays are faced with fierce competition and tourists have become true consumers. In order to unleash its full potential, Europe needs to encourage more coordination in the tourism sector and to adapt to new markets.

Indeed, while there are strong ties of integration among the Member States, they manage, at the same time, to offer a diverse range of tourism products, which appeal to different audiences. It is also a singular way of promoting ‘Europe’ as an area of excellence, and of disseminating its cultural values and standards. However, commitment to tourism requires the various Member States to be linked by a network, high levels of professional qualifications to be sought for people working in tourism, and identification standards to be created, such as brands that make it possible to effectively highlight the added value that Europe brings.

      <p sl="et">I voted in favour of the report on European tourism today because I believe that these are important suggestions for the promotion of the European tourism sector. One should not underestimate the importance of tourism – it provides 10% of European GDP and 12% of employment, which makes tourism the third most important socio-economic area of activity. I am particularly pleased that the report draws attention to the importance of several types of tourism, for instance, rural and farm tourism, nature tourism, cruise tourism and spa and health tourism. These are also important tourist avenues in Estonia, and they need to receive more attention, especially in the area of rural and nature tourism. I also support the use of a common system of labels throughout Europe, in the case of labels pertaining to cultural heritage, ecological issues and quality. The use of common labels would make consumers’ choices much easier when it comes to tourism and ensure the existence of common understandings of the requirements that should be met by a particular service. Unfortunately, this causes many misunderstandings today, because the stars used to denote the quality of hotels, for instance, are used differently from one Member State to another, and this has caused disappointment to many clients.

      <p sl="it">A way of strengthening the EU’s image worldwide is also to promote its tourism, which is already the third most important socio-economic activity in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">The tourism sector is also a great opportunity for strengthening and increasing jobs, especially in agritourism. Here there are multiple advantages. It prevents land being abandoned, which is a serious problem in the European countryside, and provides work for social classes which are generally more disadvantaged in terms of employment (young people and women).</p>
      <p sl="it">The main suggestions from the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regarding this report are based on rural tourism, which merges farming and farm production with tourism, and farm produce with sales. This is another fundamental point, because the added value is increased through the direct sale of farm produce at prices two or three times higher than wholesale prices, thus creating wealth through the use of the farm’s otherwise unused buildings.</p>
      <p sl="it">This provides a precious boost to farming income, promotes typical local produce, and finally contributes to conservation of the land by converting abandoned farm buildings.</p>

Adoption of this report in this House is the first political step towards the creation of a genuine European tourism policy, as enshrined in Article 195 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Commitment to diversified, sustainable, quality tourism that is accessible to all is this report’s main focus. As such, I would stress the importance of the need for the sector to be reclassified in order for the EU to remain the world’s number one tourist destination, and in order to ensure, at the same time, sustainable and more lasting tourism for future generations. However, challenges are arising that need to be resolved, in order to enable the sector to grow and to adapt to current conditions. Overcoming these challenges requires a clear plan of action, with a well-defined timetable and, above all, appropriate funding. I therefore think it will be important to take the tourism sector into account in the next multiannual financial framework, with emphasis on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to foster growth in a sector that has the potential to minimise the effects of the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Some of the main arguments put forward by the rapporteur are directly related to Lithuania’s tourism sector, particularly the greater need for skilled jobs and better service. Data from the Lithuanian development agency for small and medium-sized enterprises has shown that Lithuania’s tourism sector employs 43 700 people, who serve approximately 2.2 million foreign tourists each year. Almost 4.4% of EU Structural Fund money is to be allocated to Lithuania’s tourism sector for the period 2007-2013. I also agree with the rapporteur that in order to use this money more effectively, there needs to be greater emphasis on the importance of training and professional development. This should include investment in human capital, above all, new managers, administrators and entrepreneurs. Lithuania also needs to modernise its services and strengthen its tourism infrastructure if it wants to become more competitive, attracting tourists from Europe. Developing the budget airline network to and from Lithuania would be a good start. Despite Lithuania’s natural beauty – four UNESCO World Heritage Sites and an almost unique 100 km long coastline – the quality of accommodation and service often does not come up to international standards, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation’s report.

Tourism is facing several challenges, not least climate change, which has serious implications for the industry’s infrastructure and organisation. In my opinion, it is essential that we work to limit its impact on tourist seasons and employment. I would prefer to go down the route of limiting the seasonal effect by developing alternative forms of tourism. This solution will also reduce the insecurity of tourist sector jobs, which, by their nature, are seasonal. Tourism will have its own budget starting with the 2014-2020 programming period. I will be watching to ensure that, in conjunction with the cohesion policy, substantial aid is provided for all forms of tourism in order to make the sector more competitive and improve job security.

      <p sl="it">Recently, for example, the EU has stipulated that from 2015, all cars will have to be fitted with an electronic device called eCall, a life-saving device, which, in the event of an accident, will automatically send a request for help to the unique European emergency number 112, with the time, exact position and direction of travel.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, between 12 and 18 September, the joint European Seatbelt campaign was held by the European traffic police network. I hope that the future plan of action proposes equally useful measures for the safety not only of drivers but also of pedestrians.</p>

The target set in the Third Action Programme of halving the number of road deaths in the EU by the end of 2010 was not achieved, although the number has been substantially reduced. I supported the Commission communication, which sets out the strategic targets of reducing the number of road deaths in the European Union by half by 2020 (as compared with 2010). I welcome the call for a fully fledged action programme to be developed by the end of 2011, incorporating a detailed set of measures with clear timetables for their implementation, as well as monitoring instruments, so that the progress of the road safety measures in the Member States can be checked on a regular basis.</p>

This report, for which I voted, recommends the mandatory installation of devices – alcolocks – that block the vehicle if the level is over the limit for drivers who already have a drink-driving conviction. These devices should become mandatory in all new types of commercial passenger and goods transport vehicles, and the Commission should table a proposal for a directive to this end by 2013. It proposes the introduction of a maximum speed limit of 30km/h in residential areas without cycle lanes. It calls for the urgent introduction of a new European road safety action programme.

There are already too many regulations and penalties on drivers largely used as cash cows that do little to make roads safer. Any legislation based upon driving or road use is often exploited by insurance companies to push up premiums or evade insurance pay outs. The proposed legislation would call into question whether other matters would have to be harmonised, from the unit of speed to top speeds on motorways, to the process of new driver training. The system in the UK for learning to drive is long established and effective and any changes should be the remit of the UK Government.</p>

A decisive role in this respect was played by the Third European Road Safety Action Programme. Despite the above, 35 000 deaths and 1.5 million serious injuries, often with permanent consequences, occurred on European roads in 2009 alone. The social and economic costs of such traffic accidents are enormous; the loss of human life and the dramatic effect on the lives of those affected are indescribable. However, society still seems to turn a blind eye to the deadly risks that road traffic poses.</p>

I agree with the opinion of the Commission that an improvement in traffic safety requires a coherent, comprehensive and integrated approach, covering all road traffic users and all stakeholders.

Making it illegal for anyone to drive after a glass or two of wine is not the way to prevent irresponsible driving.</p>

As for banning all systems that warn drivers about speed cameras, that would be counterproductive. After all, the authorities tell us that speed cameras are supposed to be installed at danger spots, not the most profitable locations.

Successes are only achieved if they are closely based on the reality of people’s lives. Europe is not the right arena for this. Even if all the proposals were scientifically based, this is still not a matter for the EU. The best example of this is the scientifically-based proposal that, in future, children under three years of age should only travel in secure, rear-facing car seats. As a young father, I am well aware that no child aged two or three will want to sit facing backwards on the rear seat.

Unfortunately, however, I am not convinced of the correctness of the proposed measures, which are supposed to lead to greater road safety. I am very concerned about the proposals to implement an intelligent speed assistance system, the use of which is just one step away from ‘Big Brother’. I would not like to see a time when some Central European brain determines which road a driver must take, or dictates the speed at which he will travel. I am concerned about cases where technology takes over responsibility for the decisions and actions of the individual. Although the ideas about drivers taking alcohol tests before setting out on a journey are useful, in my opinion, I regard the mandatory fitting of alcolocks as a bad joke from a science fiction film. The questions raised by the mandatory installation of these technologies have not been answered, particularly as regards responsibility for the malfunctioning of these systems.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We should also not forget the greater costs which these technologies entail. For low-income groups, for example, buying a new car will become less affordable than it is at present.

In spite of the improvements on our roads, 35 000 people died and over 1.5 million were injured in 2009. Having the best interests of our citizens at heart, we should take action to increase road safety. We should coordinate the activities of road users and all interested parties. This is why we need a European coordinator who would oversee the implementation of new strategies at various levels with the support of the European Commission. We need to take practical steps to reduce the number of fatalities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Dependable statistics and reliable data concerning accidents are key factors in solving the problem of road safety. As it is the citizens who are primarily responsible for road safety, the best possible training should be available for future drivers, and severe punishments should be meted out to those who break traffic laws. The penalty points system should be standardised. Continuing driver education and technical inspections of vehicles are also essential.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The number of traffic accident victims in the EU fell by 36% in the period 2001-2009. Thanks to this, 80 000 lives have been saved since 2001. Despite these figures, 35 000 deaths occurred on European roads in 2009, and 1.5 million people were seriously injured, often with permanent consequences. The social and economic costs of these traffic accidents amounted to approximately EUR 130 billion in 2009. The objective is to halve the number of traffic accident deaths in the European Union (compared with 2010). Therefore, the Commission should develop the proposed steps into a fully-fledged action programme by the end of 2011.</p>

The target of halving the number of road deaths by 2020 must be supported through simple measures, such as the use of alcolocks for commercial road transport, reducing the speed limit to 30 km/h in residential areas and harmonising the rules of the road.

The Third European Road Safety Action Programme 2001-2010 was instrumental in bringing about that reduction. Since 2001, almost 80 000 lives have been saved as a result of the progress made. Although the target of halving the annual number of deaths has not been met, the figures are very encouraging. Despite all of that, 35 000 people died on Europe’s roads in 2009 and 1.5 million were seriously injured, many of whom were left disabled. The social and economic cost of these road accidents is huge: roughly EUR 130 billion in 2009. In addition to that, there is the loss of life, the grief of the victims’ families, the suffering of the injured and the dramatic changes to the lives of accident victims.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This own-initiative report is intended to improve road safety in Europe and encourage the discussion of best practice and success stories. It has been adopted today by a very large majority of the European Parliament with a view to reducing the number of lives lost on our roads every year from the current sobering 35 000. This represents a huge challenge, given all the variations in infrastructure, training, rules, prevention policies and penalties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also a cultural divide, particularly when it comes to alcohol consumption, which does nonetheless have universal physiological effects. We welcome the various recommendations: gradual learning from the age of 17, road safety education from a very young age, fitting alcolocks to professional vehicles and compulsory reflective jackets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we did oppose paragraph 54 on applying a 30 km/h speed limit in all urban residential areas. We must not forget that standardisation has its limits. The failure of the 30 km/h speed limit within inner Brussels is a telling example. The success of a 30 km/h zone is primarily dependent on the road layout and the associated public awareness campaign. By making 30 km/h zones the norm, there is a danger that they would become less valuable in places where they are really essential.</p>

A series of measures are being implemented in an attempt to achieve this self-imposed target. However, these are quite vague and it is doubtful whether they will enable the number of road traffic fatalities to be reduced as desired. It is also important to gather more comparable data in relation to the causes of accidents and injuries for the purposes of better coordination between the Member States. In addition, we should also be clear about the role played in serious traffic accidents by heavy goods vehicles, which are becoming increasingly dangerous, particularly in view of increasing competitive pressures, and about the fact that scrap vehicles are still to be found on Europe’s roads. Of course it would be a good thing for the public to attend regular first aid courses. However this should not be made mandatory for road users. For this reason, I have voted against.</p>

However, I believe that the negative consequences of some of the proposals contained in the legislation outweigh their positive aspects. One of these proposals was the idea to introduce speed limits of 30 km/h in residential areas, which would not only have a negative impact on the transport sector and be incomprehensible to a large section of society, but would also fail to improve safety as the law could simply be ignored. Another proposal with which I found myself in disagreement was the introduction of a ban on the manufacture of systems that warn drivers of radar speed checks.

      <p sl="de">The greater part of Europe’s road network is designed to cater for the typical dimensions of modern heavy goods vehicles. The Commission favours ‘gigaliners’, however. ‘Gigaliners’ are up to 25 metres in length and weigh up to 60 tonnes. These giants impair the field of vision of other drivers and the overtaking distances on national roads are increased dramatically. Furthermore, much greater damage – both to people and vehicles – is to be expected when collisions occur. The EU’s plans to halve the number of fatal road accidents by 2020 thus seems like a distant dream. It is important that these ‘gigaliners’ should be banned from our roads.

I voted in favour of this report, because it aims to halve the number of deaths by 2020. The document calls on EU governments to pay more attention to road infrastructure and ensure better cooperation between the Member States. Until now, if your driving licence is taken away in one EU Member State, it is still possible to obtain a duplicate in another Member State if you live or work there, and this is wrong. It is therefore necessary to establish an EU system for exchanging information on documents. One of the report’s innovative proposals is also important – to install alcohol sensors in all new cars, which would prevent a car from being started if they detect that the driver is at all drunk. It is right to propose increasing fines – drivers who have had a licence for less than two years should be subject to a zero alcohol rule when they take the wheel. Many accidents could also be avoided by using simpler means of prevention: better located road signs, lighting and vigilant traffic police.</p>

The establishment of a ‘genuine’ EU observatory and the position of an EU coordinator would not just generate unnecessary bureaucracy. Experience shows that we would quickly have a new, costly agency. On top of this, there are cost-intensive proposals for the mandatory introduction of new electronic playthings such as alcohol meters, fatigue alert systems or speed regulation systems. This is superfluous. It is discriminatory to require over 65s to undergo regular physical, mental and psychological testing of their driving capabilities. The standardised use of winter tyres is unrealistic in view of the different climatic conditions in the various Member States. The call for obligatory rear-facing seats for children under three is also out-of-touch. This would prevent you from watching the child or communicating with it. All the child can see is the backrest in front of it, it will become fractious and will finally escape from the seat. A child would be able to manage this from the age of two at least.

I am particularly interested in, inter alia, the initiatives on improving the quality of training for young drivers, the introduction of obligatory eye tests for drivers and improvements in safety at level crossings. However, I am not fully convinced by some of the rapporteur’s suggestions, such as restricting the speed limit to 30 km/h in residential areas and on all single-lane roads in urban areas which have no separate cycle lane (I voted against this provision). Some of the initiatives do not include deadlines or methods of implementation, and taking the complexity of the problem into consideration, it would not be possible to introduce them at this moment in time.</p>

Approximately 40-80 million people have been forced to leave their homes during the construction of huge dams. Dams change rivers and the use of natural resources and have a major impact on biological diversity and river ecosystems and, above all, pose a threat to communities. On every continent, dams threaten people or the ecosystem. One real example is in Brazil, where a licence has been granted to construct the world’s third largest dam, although its construction will do incalculable damage to the Amazon’s ecosystem and biodiversity. Around 50 000 people will also be forced to leave their homes. It is necessary to reduce dam building because, according to current estimates, by 2050, there will be a major risk of floods, endangering around 2 billion people.

In my opinion, it is essential to adopt a multi-level flood prevention strategy in regions where unstable glacier lakes represent the key flood threat and further aggravate the effects of global warming on precipitation systems, as well as the presence of black carbon, which demonstrably accelerates the decline of glaciers.</p>

The melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas is initially expected to increase river flows for two to three decades, but flows will then decrease substantially in the longer term. It is thus essential to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to address droughts in the future. Immediate action must be taken with a view to reducing carbon monoxide and methane emissions, mainly through the promotion of research and investment in technology aimed at reducing polluting emissions, as a fast-action method of halting glacial and snow melting.

In this context, water shortages resulting from access problems represent a prime danger to sustainable development. However, we must not disregard the severe environmental impact caused by ‘large dams’, or their effects on local populations: it is estimated that some 40-80 million people have been displaced for this reason. As such, the EU’s efforts should be towards promoting the use of means of energy production that, without sacrificing the energy needed, have less of an environmental impact: we should not just be thinking about using renewable energy sources, but also about opting for small dams instead of large constructions.

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the Deva report on dam infrastructure in developing countries because, bearing in mind that water is a vital resource for farming and for the survival of the population in developing countries, the proposals made in the report are a step in the right direction.

      <p sl="fr">The report adopted on Tuesday by the European Parliament on dam infrastructures in developing countries makes constructive proposals on a number of points, such as population displacements linked to dam building.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this text, Parliament expresses its concern that the World Bank has committed USD 100 billion to dam construction which has resulted in between 40 and 80 million people being displaced without receiving any financial compensation at all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The danger of using large-scale dams to prevent flood damage has also been taken into account, as the safety of these dams is threatened by the rise in the frequency and intensity of flooding, which is mainly linked to climate change. The European Parliament has taken this opportunity to call on the Union to increase its commitment to reducing greenhouse gases in order to achieve its aim of ensuring that the global temperature does not rise more than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.</p>

The report picks up on the recommendations of the United Nations and draws conclusions from the report of the World Commission on Dams, which recommends implementing fewer new projects and concentrating instead on optimising existing dams, getting to the root of the problem instead of wasting one’s energies on moderate successes in combating the symptoms, further countering the EU’s Millennium Development Goals, which now seem extremely unlikely to be met.

      <p sl="it">There has been a constant increase in the frequency of serious floods throughout the second half of the 20th century and this will become an even more serious problem in the coming decades.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to a United Nations estimate, by 2050, some 2 billion people will have to live under the threat of severe flood damage. Even if floods are coming to be a serious problem for Western countries as well, it needs to be reiterated that developing countries, with their lack of early warning systems and sturdy buildings, are, unfortunately, the most vulnerable to the effects of flooding. Among other things, the economies of these countries are largely based on agriculture and, if agricultural areas are not securely protected from the effects of flooding, the damage caused could give rise not only to loss of earnings but also to a serious slowdown in the already fragile economic system.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the European Union must continue down its chosen road by committing to support the construction of dams in these countries and to improve the protection of buildings from floods by developing floodplain storage and appropriate bypass systems.

I agree with the rapporteur that the European institutions and the Member States still do not consider the eradication of poverty, hunger and malnutrition to be their key strategic goal, despite strong commitments regarding the enforcement of human rights in relation to food, water, energy, etc. Consequently, in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, it will be crucial to review, and to change if necessary, all EU strategies, such as Europe 2020, Global Europe, energy policy, the sustainable development strategy and the future of EU development cooperation in general. Furthermore, the EU and the Member States must stand up for their commitments to fight poverty and hunger worldwide within international organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF and WTO. I share the rapporteur’s concerns over the EU’s trade strategy, which focuses on competition and market access for EU products and which fails to provide a pro-development approach. A further reduction of tariffs on agricultural imports from developing countries should be encouraged in order to promote economic growth in those countries.</p>

Even though it appears that there is enough food available, many people do not have the money to buy their basic food materials. The issue of access to food must be tackled. To this end, we fully support the measures that are discussed in the report in relation to the security of food supply. The agricultural sector and CAP have a very important role as we try to achieve food security in the EU and in the wider world. CAP must, after 2013, be able to tackle the new challenges of food security, such as climate change, volatility in the market and territorial equality.

There has been a month-on-month rise in food prices since August 2010, in line with a trend over the last ten years, with levels now higher than during the food price peak of 2008. The volatility of commodity prices is impacting greatly on low-income countries and the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalised segments of the populations of developing countries. I agree that the European Union and the Member States must, as a matter of urgency, make new investments in agriculture and rural development, introducing dedicated mechanisms for stockpiling sufficiently large quantities of basic foodstuffs, removing their own barriers to trade, and reducing the debt of the countries most affected. In view of the growing global population and increasing pressure on natural resources, it is essential to establish more sustainable, energy-saving and efficient forms of production globally.

      <p sl="it">Food security is a prerequisite for achieving balanced development at all levels. Its relationship with sustainable production in the primary sector can be seen in a number of different ways. In environmental terms, it is expressed through the use of eco-friendly techniques and products and through a non-speculative enhancement and management of the immense natural resources that are found in developing countries in particular. In economic terms, it is expressed partly by enhancing the competitive advantages between the various areas and countries – which can also enable developing countries to play an integral role in balanced and global growth – and partly by promoting the link with the land through a focus on locally sourced products, where energy costs and pollution linked to transport and the quality and tradition of the products can be better protected. In social terms, the processes of gradual urbanisation and population growth, above all, in developing countries, have to be reconciled with the needs of living in these places.

According to the FAO, the estimated number of people suffering hunger was 925 million in 2010, and there are signs that this figure could be increasing.

However, this is not an appropriate time for entering into a debate on the future of the common agricultural policy and, even less, on a financial transaction tax (FTT).

Achievement of this goal is being made harder by food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and in developing countries. Following a slight decline in 2010, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation forecasts that the number of people suffering from hunger will increase in 2011, owing to the economic and financial crisis, which has caused an increase in the price of food products. Climate change, loss of biodiversity, degradation of soils, pressure on water resources and biofuels can be added to this problem.

I believe that it is essential that the EU supports the UN incentive regarding the basic social protection level, which could help meet the basic food needs of the poor.

      <p sl="lt">We must do everything we can to ensure that when there is large-scale hunger, the EU can react as swiftly as possible. A poor response in the face of hundreds of thousands of deaths does not help the EU’s image in the international arena, even though it is the world’s biggest donor. Hunger and food insecurity are not just caused by natural disasters. In some way or other, we can trace their origins back to international trade. It is important to coordinate EU trade policy and other sectoral policies so as to minimise their contribution to food insecurity in developing countries. Nevertheless, most of the reasons lie in the internal policies of the countries concerned, ineffective governance and armed conflicts. I am therefore convinced that those aid measures that are oriented towards long-term development have a real impact. At the same time, it is necessary to encourage African countries to take greater responsibility for creating general welfare on the continent and to establish a collective aid mechanism for the citizens of African countries suffering from hunger and food insecurity.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I voted in favour of Ms Zimmer’s report because I think that the issue of food security in developing countries is of paramount importance to security and peace in the world, especially in view of the growing population. This is why I would like to highlight a few important points. First of all, in order to create conditions conducive to improving food security, it is important to encourage the emergence of regional markets in developing countries by using economic partnership agreements. Secondly, I think that when calculating the amount of development aid to be provided to certain countries, greater consideration needs to be given to food security problems. Lastly, I would like to draw attention to the fact that agriculture accounts for only 4% of Official Development Assistance (ODA), whereas 75% of the world’s poor live in rural areas. This is why, in my view, the issue of agriculture must be at the top of the agenda when devising development programmes. I think that this marks an important step towards improving food security in the world and combating hunger. We must take measures to enable us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for combating hunger. Let us respond while there is still time.</p>

In 2010, almost a billion people were starving, a quarter of the world’s children under the age of five were malnourished and about a third of them were dying of hunger. I voted in favour of this resolution because it demands that additional action be taken as a matter of urgency to combat hunger. We are calling for an end to food price speculation, which distorts the market and increases prices. People tortured by hunger, particularly in African countries, are unable to buy products that have increased in price. The resolution also calls for an assessment of the changes to the common agricultural policy and for the strengthening of cooperation between the EU and non-governmental organisations combating hunger. In the document, countries and regions in which hunger prevails are urged to store some food so that people would have something to eat in the event of a sudden change in weather conditions, or political or other types of crises. As food is more important than the production of energy, we propose that, while there are still hungry people in the world, we should stop biofuel production. It occupies vast areas of land which could be used for food production.</p>

I have some reservations about specific paragraphs in this report, namely those referring to export subsidies, to reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and to the competitiveness of agriculture in developing countries. I advocate greater caution from the EU as regards reducing export subsidies, since, while it is important that we make reductions, such measures should obey the principle of reciprocity on the part of other trade blocs in the context of World Trade Organisation negotiations. I am also unable to fully agree with the rapporteur’s calls for deeper reform of the CAP to enable developing countries to be more competitive. This idea should be considered and, above all, put into its exact context, since there are several factors beyond the CAP that contribute to distorting trade. Finally, as regards the competitiveness of developing countries, there are multiple factors at play, and the lack of competitiveness cannot be solely attributed to subsidised agriculture in developed countries.</p>

The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated the number of hungry people in 2010 at 925 million. Nine hundred and twenty-five million people who are hungry in this day and age! We are also currently witnessing the most severe famine for the last 40 years in the Horn of Africa. The EU must promote agriculture in the developing world as a way to address this issue. However, issues such as speculation in commodities, water shortages and climate change must also be addressed in order to promote agriculture. The right to adequate food has to become a reality. The EU must do more to promote the eradication of poverty and the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals. To this end, we must limit speculation in food and agricultural commodity markets, as this has a devastating impact on food scarcity. I welcome this report and the recommendations therein.</p>

Yet the EU and the 27 Member States remain the leading political and financial stakeholders, and the discussions on a new common food security policy are a step in the right direction. The question is whether it will be able to tackle the challenges linked to food security: unbridled population growth, pressure on natural resources and the disastrous consequences of global warming for agriculture. It is clear that we need to establish a political framework within the EU for combating world hunger: it really is vital that we make this a top priority.

At the MDG Summit in September 2010, it was reported that progress towards the achievement of the hunger targets had clearly been insufficient. According to the FAO, the estimate of hungry people in 2010 was 925 million, down from 1 023 million in 2009, but still more than the number of undernourished people in 2008 (about 815 million). There is strong evidence that food price increases during the last few months have already augmented that number even if there are still no official figures available from the FAO. New challenges, including the growing threat of food speculation, climate change, global land acquisitions, biofuels, loss of biodiversity, land degradation and pressures on water, have contributed to further affect the state of food security in the world. In this context, the current problems around hunger and malnutrition have led to a rethink of the food security approach, not only at an EU level, but also at the global level.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, I am pleased that the issue that was particularly close to my heart – energy self-sufficiency – has been entirely carried over in paragraph 22. I think that it is important to point out that part of the aid for developing countries ought to contribute to the setting up of facilities for generating renewable energy and towards good water management. All of this should be done with a view to an aid system that is designed to transmit know-how, with the ultimate aim of freeing these countries from foreign influence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Self-sufficiency, whether in energy or food production, must be integrated into the policies of those developing countries aiming to improve their food security, particularly through the implementation of food strategies designed to alleviate poverty and, ultimately, make the aid itself superfluous.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will conclude with a clarification: as shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the AGRI committee. I voted against paragraph 63. I did so because in the opinion that we delivered to the DEVE committee, we had already emphasised the need to gradually phase out export subsidies (see paragraph 29) but we cannot accept that the DEVE committee should, in a later paragraph, impose the complete removal of incentives during the full revision of the common agricultural policy.</p>

In view of the urgency, Member States of the Union need to take action immediately in order to release new investment for agriculture and rural development, to combat speculation on food products, to limit biofuels, to ensure that there are adequate world stocks, to eliminate their own trade barriers and to reduce debt in the worst-hit countries.</p>

There are a number of reasons for this phenomenon, not least the volatility and constant increase of food prices since 2007. In addition to demonstrating the role of the EU and the Member States in seeking food security solutions, this report aims to create a joint programme of the European institutions and Member States towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Following the Commission’s tabling of the EU policy framework on food and nutrition security in March 2010, the role of small-scale food production, which constitutes the basis for developing economies, should be stressed. There is an urgent need to adopt clear and specific aid policies and programmes that take into account the diverse situations of developing countries. Learning on the job is essential to training farmers and to countries’ self-sufficiency. Moreover, there is a need for a clear commitment to research and innovation in order to increase agricultural productivity.

Something is definitely out of order if you pay five times less in The Gambia for milk from Holland than for milk from a local producer and Dutch potatoes cost a quarter of the price for which this product can be delivered to the market by a Gambian farmer. These price variations do not result from a higher productivity of Dutch producers, but from the European subsidy policy. First, we contribute from our taxes to enable our producers to squeeze out local producers from markets in the developing countries, and then we provide handouts to these countries in the form of the development aid. As a result, we pay twice and people in The Gambia feel that their efforts are useless. Somewhere here, there is a way to provide quick and effective aid to developing countries.</p>

Likewise, it is important to use international standardisation to protect consumers, the environment, health and labour regulations on product safety, and intellectual property rights.

      <p sl="sk">On 9 November, the Commission presented a communication on the future trade strategy of the European Union entitled ‘Trade, Growth and World Affairs’. This communication is primarily a follow-up to the Global Europe strategy presented in 2006. However, previous evaluations of the strategies presented indicate that a number of their objectives have still not been achieved. All stakeholders have to review the reasons why such a situation has occurred and draw the necessary conclusions from it. The world has changed dramatically in recent years. World trade has witnessed a major expansion thanks to the World Trade Organisation and a number of other initiatives and has begun to include, since the 1990s, an ever-increasing number of emerging and developing countries, which have become a driving force of the global economy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This appeared mainly in the recession years of 2008 and 2009, when it was mostly the emerging countries that had a stabilising effect on the global economy. Now, 18%, i.e. 36 million jobs in the EU depend on foreign trade and it is expected that by 2015, 90% of global economic growth will be generated outside the EU. Therefore, I consider it important that the Commission prepares a prospective study reflecting the current reality of the global economy and the current state of the EU, as well as probable future development.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the Commission is urged to present a forward-looking and innovative future strategy on trade and investment, taking into account the new challenges of the EU, and also to deliver forecasts of how the ‘world of trade’ could look in a policy planning perspective of 15 to 20 years, and to take such forecasts as the basis for presenting a revised mid- and long-term strategy by the summer of 2013. The EU must also take account of the fact that population growth is declining steeply inside the EU, at the same time as the population of developing countries, in particular, is continuing to increase dramatically. This will have an impact on countries’ economic situations. If we consider that 18% of jobs inside the EU, in other words, 36 million jobs, are presently dependent on external trade, and 90% of worldwide economic growth will probably be generated outside the European Union by 2015, we see how important it is to formulate and implement a long-term external trade strategy which reflects the EU’s changing role in the world economy. Therefore, taking into account these developments, I welcomed the resolution’s call on the Commission to draw up a forward-looking study which takes into account the current realities of the global economy and the current situation of the EU in addition to probable future developments. This should provide a basis on which the Commission can draw up a long-term strategy which fully addresses the needs of the EU and its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The removal of non-tariff barriers must also be one of our objectives, as they have often hindered trade: more regulatory convergence with our partners and more tangible results from the high-level structured dialogues with China, Japan and the United States. These are the directions to be followed. Reciprocity also concerns the international public procurement markets: the aim is not to close our markets and give in to protectionism; rather, the degree of opening up of public procurement markets in Europe should be compensated by the same degree of access to third-country public procurement markets for EU suppliers.</p>

It is the responsibility of the Commission to realise the goals of the Global Europe strategy.

The fact is that the EU’s overall trade performance is declining and the EU’s share of GDP is falling as a result of the rapid progress of the emerging countries.

      <p sl="sk">Thanks to the World Trade Organisation and to a number of multilateral and bilateral initiatives, world trade has witnessed a major expansion. Despite this fact, the European Union, which, at the time of the introduction of the Lisbon strategy in 2000, accounted for 25% of global GDP, is expected to have only an 18% share in 2020. Meanwhile, various sources estimate that China and India, which generated only 10% of global GDP in 2000, will attain a 25% share in 2020. Such a change should also be reflected in EU policies. While EU population growth is slowing down, population numbers in other countries, particularly in the developing countries, continue to see a rapid growth. Nowadays, 18% of jobs in the EU, that is 36 million jobs, depend on foreign trade. It is expected that by 2015, 90% of global economic growth will be generated outside the European Union.

With this in mind, it may make sense first to assess the old strategies and to explain why these could not be met and why some strategies only exist on paper. When we hear talk at EU level of the strengthening of global competitiveness, this often only relates to large companies and multinational concerns. However, the driving force of the economy and the main employers are the many small and medium-sized enterprises, whose importance is always underlined in the various strategies laid down on paper, but which, in fact, have had very little access to subsidies, and which are burdened with ever-increasing bureaucracy.

The first area with which I disagree concerns conceding exceptional trade preferences to third countries as a means of emergency aid in disaster situations. The EU has specific instruments for emergency aid and trade preferences are clearly ill-suited to this purpose, both because they are slow to take effect and because it is hard to focus them on those most in need of aid in these situations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, while financial aid comes out of the EU budget, trade preferences will only affect those countries damaged by imports facilitated by exemptions from or reductions in customs duties, which are usually the EU’s less rich countries, as demonstrated by what has happened with the Pakistan case.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also voted against the reservations expressed in the report regarding the use of ‘trade defence instruments’, or anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. These are essential to fair trade, as they constitute action that can be taken against unfair and anti-competitive trade practices by certain countries – China, for one – that cause serious harm to European companies within the European market itself.</p>

In this context, there are several points that are not dealt with adequately in this report, even though they are key to sustainable competitiveness in the EU: on the one hand, the interests and problems of the small and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of our economy are not sufficiently considered: I am thinking, in particular, of the access of small and medium-sized businesses to financial supports for international trade in order to enable them to put themselves on an international footing and to promote their capacity for innovation in this direction. This leads me to another point: European companies (in particular SMEs) still experience enormous problems in enforcing their intellectual property rights in third countries, particularly in Asia. We urgently need to take action against the trade barriers imposed by third countries, whether tariff-based or non-tariff-based. The EU imposes strict competition rules on itself. However, at the same time, we also need to combat unfair state supports for domestic production in third countries, otherwise our businesses will soon find themselves left behind.

In November 2010, the Commission issued its new trade strategy under the title ‘Trade, Growth and Global Affairs’, defining it as the ‘external dimension’ of the Europe 2020 strategy. The paper replaces the ‘Global Europe’ strategy of 2005, under the then Trade Commissioner Mandelson. The new strategy basically continues the approach of ‘Global Europe’, that is mainly the continuation of a free trade and market access policy through bilateral trade agreements, which go deep into non-trade issues such as public procurement, investment, regulatory cooperation and removal of non-tariff barriers. However, the new strategy is a little more cautious in its overall tone. The happily drunken trust in global economic openness as the best way of stimulating growth in the EU has gone away a little. The new strategy puts emphasis on fairness and reciprocity principles in the market opening of partner countries announcing that violations of market opening commitments in third countries will be brought systematically to court. Basically, it still fully defends full economic liberalisation and sees challenges only in the unfair practices of some partner countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Caspary, which represents Parliament’s assessment of the EU’s new trade policy strategy, tabled by the Commission in November 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as expressing his hope for a more long-term international trade policy from the Commission, Mr Caspary also underlines the need to integrate trade policy more coherently with the EU’s other policies – above all, with industrial policy. European economic and industrial competitiveness is at the core of the trade strategy from now until 2020. We need initiatives that are designed to strengthen trade with the EU’s biggest trading partners, stem the proliferation of customs duties or other forms of customs barriers, ensure access to raw materials (including through new relationships with third-country markets) and avoid unfair practices that are counterproductive for the interests of European businesses.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">This is one of several extremely important debates which are being held by the European Parliament this week. It is also the European Parliament’s reaction to economic events which are currently taking place in Europe. As you know, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our rapporteurs in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have reached a good solution on the six-pack. We will be voting on this tomorrow, so no decisions have yet been made, but this was sterling work by Parliament and especially by our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. Today, we have the opportunity to discuss important matters concerning the economic and monetary situation in Europe with the President of the Eurogroup, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I will remind you of the rules: Question Time will consist of two parts. In part one, the chairs of the political groups will ask questions. The initial question asked by each chair will take one minute, and one minute will be allowed for the answer. If any of the chairs wishes to ask a supplementary question, he may ask a supplementary question lasting half a minute, and Mr Juncker will be allowed half a minute to answer it.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Part two will consist of questions from the Chamber – the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure, with which we are all familiar.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Juncker, for weeks and months now, the leaders of the euro area have shown how determined they are to stand up for the euro and to make European solidarity the cornerstone for their political actions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet we need to recognise that what has been decided since the summer is not enough, is too late and, above all, difficult to implement. You get the feeling that it is the markets rather than politics now in the driving seat. That cannot last. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that only strong and simultaneous EU decisions will have the necessary weight to reassure our fellow citizens and the markets of our decision-making ability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Juncker, intergovernmental management of the crisis has reached the end of the road. As both a head of government and President of the Eurogroup, can you tell us then what the plans are to get us out of the crisis?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The worst thing is that we cannot see a way out. There are a number of instruments: Eurobonds, guarantees from AAA countries, quadrupling the stability fund’s firepower, but over and above these instruments, where is the political will and how do we bring it all together? We need to be strong and, above all, we need to lead the way in getting out of the crisis. So where are you?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you are addressing me here as the President of the Eurogroup and not as the Luxembourg Prime Minister. I have got to admit that, on some of the things you have just mentioned, the Luxembourg Prime Minister has a stronger internal mandate than that of the President of the Eurogroup, which is more limited. Having said that, I would need at least a minute to talk about each of the subjects that you have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that Europe has reacted at a snail’s pace and not as quickly as it should have. For this I blame the severity of the crisis, the lack of any early analysis and the fact that the 17 members of the euro area are unique in that the Heads of State or Government and finance ministers represent 17 democracies whose governments are made up of at least 50 political parties. As someone who so gracefully masters the various games and challenges of this House, you must understand how tricky it is.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that what we need to do is translate all the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Governments of the euro area on 21 July into reality and fact, and that we think outside the box of what was agreed on 21 July. With my Luxembourg Prime Minister’s hat on, I am telling you that I prefer the community method by far over the intergovernmental method that we have seen in recent years.</p>

    <intervention id="2-486-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, my first question is directed to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. You are now a member of this circle of Heads of State or Government of the euro area, which is pursuing the policy of intergovernmentalisation that you have just criticised. In other words, you are now a member of the club of intergovernmentalists. We have heard from you that you are nothing of the sort, but I must now hold you responsible for your esteemed colleagues with whom you regularly meet. I would like to ask Mr Juncker for his response to the fact that the President of the Eurogroup, in other words, the finance minister of the euro area, is to be kicked out and replaced with a function not provided for in the European Treaties, namely, the President of the European Council of the 27 Member States – as I understand it, although I may have misread the Treaty, this is Mr Van Rompuy, the President of the 27 Heads of State or Government. In a declaration of autonomy, the 17 Heads of State or Government, yourself included, have now stated that Mr Van Rompuy should also head up the euro area or the economic governance of the euro area. My question to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg is as follows: how is it that this function is not to be transferred to the President of the Eurogroup, who is actually predestined for this role and who, I believe, on the evidence of his actions to date, is exactly the right person for this position?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-487-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jean-Claude Juncker" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Eurogroup">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, my long friendship with Mr Schulz has encouraged him to describe me as both perpetrator and victim in his speech in my support to this House. Accordingly, I find myself in a mood that may well match his permanent state of mind.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have some reservations about the way we manage the euro area. I am aware of the weaknesses – including the weaknesses in my own administration and tenure of office – and I certainly believe that we need urgent reform and revision here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy have proposed appointing the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, as President of the euro formation within the European Council, and I concur with this proposal because I believe that we already have sufficient dividing lines between the 17 euro countries and the 27 Member States of the European Union. Anyone who can head up a group of 27 countries can certainly lead 17 of these 27 Member States without a huge readjustment.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would not be happy to back a development that would see the Heads of State or Government take over command in such a way that the specific Council formations, such as this informal Eurogroup, would no longer be able to fulfil their functions. I know from experience that it takes several hours’ work each day to perform this task properly. A lot of time needs to be spent meeting with the Member States and listening to their positions in order to do some sort of justice to this task.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would not like to see the finance ministers, who meet every month, slowing down in their decision making. You will tell me that that cannot happen, but I can assure you that we could be even slower than we already are. We cannot have a situation where, whenever something goes wrong and a reaction is needed, we always get hung up on the conclusions of the European Council – which are, in any case, always very differently understood by those drafting the conclusions and those interpreting them – or that we might not be prepared to make a decision because the next planned European Council meeting is to be in euro formation or because we have to refer the matter back to the Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should make decisions on a faster, more thorough and more efficient basis. That is why we need a consensus between the President of the European Council and the President of the Eurogroup. This condition is met at present.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, firstly, I am extremely pleased to see someone who has always been on our side over the many years of battles in the European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker, someone who has always stood up for the Community cause and the European cause with us. I have one question to ask him about economic governance. You know that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have proposed the introduction of a European economic government meeting twice a year. I do not know what your experience as Prime Minister is, Mr Juncker, but I thought it would be at least twice a week that it should meet, or even, if necessary, twice a day, but not twice a year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So is your position that a European economic government cannot be organised with full-time people actually at the initiative of the European Commission rather than at that of an intergovernmental organisation? What is more, I have heard you say: ‘Yes, the Eurogroup needs to be chaired by a full-time President’. Do you also not think that the Eurogroup could be chaired by the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, rather than starting to invent other institutional ‘gizmos’, as they are doing now, which will solve nothing, because the financial markets expect a complete economic and fiscal Union. Only in this way, and not with ‘institutional games’, will we overcome the crisis surrounding the euro on the basis of intergovernmentalism, aiming to safeguard the power of EU Member States.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-491-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jean-Claude Juncker" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Eurogroup">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have quite a broad approach to the notion of economic governance. In 1991, during the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union, I argued in favour of economic governance, and I am very happy that a type of ecumenism – which, at the time, could not be hammered out – has now seen the light of day. However, I do wonder about the exact content of this expression depending on who uses it. We would firstly need to agree on the exact content of this notion which, in my eyes, must have a large scope, ranging from financial, budgetary, economic and other policies to social policies, because those who talk of government are also talking about social policy. When we talk about government, we are not just talking about economics, budget and finances; we are also talking about Europe’s social dimension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am a supporter of an institutional system even if, nowadays, it is more about intergovernance than Community; I am in favour of a system which gives credence to the European Commission. Everything is not possible with the Commission but nothing is possible without it. The Commission should not systematically be eliminated from our way of working, deliberating and deciding. Would I even go so far as to say that the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs should chair the Eurogroup? I wonder. The one who proposes cannot be the one who presides over decision making. I think, however, that it is totally the right thing to strengthen the role of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs within the Commission itself by giving him or her the powers currently held by the Commissioner for Competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs must not be bound by the consensus-seeking constraints of the Commission.</p>

    <intervention id="2-492-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, do you not think that it is all being slightly over exaggerated. We have a President of the Eurogroup. He cannot be the Commission’s Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs as he is the independent President of the Eurogroup; an important person. We have the President of the Commission who says ‘I look after economic and monetary affairs with the commissioner. We have the commissioners for economic and monetary affairs, we have the President of the European Council’. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy say ‘It’s his place to preside over the euro’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, for now, we have at least four, maybe five people in Europe in charge of the euro. However, things have never been so bad for the euro and that is because there are five people in charge of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think this is the first issue that we need to tackle. I am not one for solving all problems institutionally, but these problems need to be addressed as quickly as possible. And I think and I hope, and I am totally convinced, that Luxembourg, along with Belgium and the Netherlands, will be on the side of those wanting to defend the community method against these proposals. Perhaps you are not aware, Mr Schulz, but Mr Rutte has proposed that there be a specially appointed commissioner to safeguard the application of the Stability Pact; quite a U-turn on their part but one I welcome (inaudible).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in solidarity with the other Benelux countries, I feel I must correct what Mr Verhofstadt quoted Mr Rutte as saying. Just like me, a moment ago, Mr Rutte called for a different role being given in the Commission to the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. I totally agree with him. As for the rest, you rightly pointed out the many advantages we have acquired from the various treaties multiplying the number of people in charge of the various policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There was a time when you and I were young prime ministers – albeit me younger than you; as far as I am concerned, normal rules do not apply as I am still here, with the shared past experiences weighing heavily on my memory – we supported initiatives to merge the functions of the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This idea, although supported by Guy Verhofstadt, was rejected by the Member States. I therefore have to accept the political reality …</p>

      <p sl="fr">This idea has no chance, I am sorry to say, because I think a clever merger of these two functions would have given the European initiative greater coherence, both inside and outside the EU. We are not there anymore, however, and the next time there is a major change of treaty, you and I will no longer be MEPs … Well, maybe me.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, my question will be very simple. The European Union includes euro area members and non-euro area members. Certain rules should apply to euro area members, because the euro is simply not for everyone. The euro requires the fulfilment of certain criteria. My own country is not a euro area member, but I have no desire whatsoever to see the single European currency fail. I would therefore like to ask whether you admit the possibility that, in the interests of defending the single European currency, one or more countries may have to quit the European monetary union, so that they can devalue their own currencies and thus break free of the economic crisis, as this is not possible in the current situation. The question is therefore whether you admit the possibility of either the voluntary or involuntary departure of one or more countries from the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It will only exacerbate problems for the countries in question. Firstly for those countries, and secondly, for the currency area as a whole; and that would entail massive risks beyond the single currency area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Greece has no problem, nor do Ireland and Portugal, because they are members of the euro area. It was not the unemployed in Greece or workers in Ireland who brought about the downfall of Lehman Brothers.

Do you admit the possibility that those countries which are not yet euro area members and which have not negotiated a permanent opt-out such as the UK has, for example, should, in the current situation, reconsider whether they want to join the euro area at all? Countries such as mine, for example, signed an accession agreement where they undertook to adopt the euro in a situation very different to the one prevailing today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am aware of the fact that a Member State that had no exemption has taken some liberties regarding this treaty requirement, but I did not want to immediately exclude a Member State that meets the criteria for becoming a euro area member as the status quo and the overall atmosphere would have changed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">My question is to Jean-Claude Juncker. Whether you are answering as the Luxembourg Prime Minister or as President of the Eurogroup, I do not care.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to stop beating around the bush. The problem is this: we will not solve anything by creating institution after institution. Either the Commission works – in other words, economic governance – and it is up to it to carry out the decisions of the Council and European Parliament, or you do not agree with the Commission and you are not happy with it – you proposed it, but you are not happy with it – so let us discuss changing the Commission. However, we need to stop those who may have been responsible for proposing bad presidents of the Commission from creating parallel institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not see why the President of the Commission cannot now be in the driving seat for economic governance. Why would Mr Barroso not do as well as Mr Van Rompuy? We have heard nothing intelligent from Mr Van Rompuy since he became EU President! Why should it be Mr Van Rompuy who drags us out of the slump we all find ourselves in? My question is simple: why not reinforce the Commission’s ability to direct governance? Mr Verhofstadt is quite right: if we want economic governance in Europe, then we need to work on it continuously every day. And I mean every day! I do not really see the point of a meeting every six months. Whether they go to Deauville or somewhere else, it is pointless. They can play casino if they want but stop thinking they are going to solve Europe’s problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I call for the Commission to be reinforced: the Commission and the EU executive, and not Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I must say to Mr Cohn-Bendit that I have had more opportunity than him to hear and to listen to Mr Van Rompuy. It is not true that he has said nothing intelligent to date. He is a good President of the European Council and, therefore, I cannot understand why anyone would question his personality and the role that he plays with skill and, all too often – more often than you are present – great determination, where necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Van Rompuy is not the man that people often describe him as. He is described as being a pen-pusher for the major shareholders. That is not true – unless I have become one of the EU’s major shareholders – as he consults everybody.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I defend one principle, others attack a principle. If we are going to look at the finer details, you will find me on the side of those who have a flair for detail. I will say one thing, however: I do not agree with those that say Van Rompuy is useless.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it is not the job of the Commission to govern. The general architecture and economics of the Treaty, or indeed the Treaties, makes no mention of the Commission being intended to govern. The Commission proposes. I wish it and all the others would show greater and fuller respect for the Commission’s potential monopoly on initiative and its role as the driving force behind proposals. However, turning the Commission into a government, no, I do not believe our institutional order would allow it now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us go back to the Community method: you know as well as I do; the Commission puts forward the proposals, and the Council makes the decisions in consultation with Parliament as set out in the Treaties. I am all for extending the scope of codecision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the Treaty stands, however, we cannot do what you say. I agree that we must not increase the number of bodies, inner circles, darkened rooms where those supposed to be governing Europe can meet. The fact is, the Eurogroup is not a parallel structure. The Eurogroup, while being informal, was established under the Treaty of Lisbon having first been set up informally by us after the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, I agree that we need to discuss reinforcing the Commission. I am the first to support a Commission that is as strong as possible, but do not think for one second, do not imagine that governments will disappear completely from the decision-making process for the euro area or the European Union. Just look at the ratification debates, including in one of your two countries next Thursday, at the Bundestag: governments are accountable to their own parliaments. You cannot pull down the existing support structures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I urge us to return to the Community method which has produced good results, and that, for the time being, we accept the intergovernmental method, mindful of the fact that at a later date, we will have to include in the Treaties what has been experienced, dare I say, at intergovernmental level. As the Treaties stand, however, the institutionally noble solutions that you mentioned, which I like, are not applicable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there are moments in history where three or four minutes were better than one minute, right? Two things then. Firstly, when it comes to competition, the Commission governs. It governs and it makes the decisions. So it is not completely true to simply say ‘The Commission proposes’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, if we have a problem with Mr Van Rompuy, it is because, until now, he has refused to explain himself to the European Parliament. I cannot imagine a solution to the economic crisis and institutions where the one who makes the decisions in a resolute, intelligent and fearless way would only be accountable to the European Council. If there is no accountability for the EU institutions, the Commission and Parliament, then it is all a waste of time; that is the problem. Getting to know a little more about both Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, I think that they have rightly chosen to reinforce Mr Van Rompuy to withdraw from the Community method. That is what is at stake today and not the opposite. That is why I think that the Commission needs to be reinforced and that, if we do not agree with Mr Barroso’s Presidency, we need to discuss another Commission.</p>

With regard to the instrument that is the European Financial Stability Facility: when we finally get this in mid-October, then the function currently provided by the European Central Bank will be transferred to the European facility.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, your detachment from reality is almost unbelievable. You are behaving like a political ostrich, pretending none of it is happening. You just told us a few moments ago that Greece fundamentally has no problems because it is a member of the eurozone. I mean, that is just deluded. You wrote recently that the euro’s 13-year history is a success story. Well, it is a very odd kind of success, is it not, and actually saying that frankly beggars belief and I think hardly makes you credible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is about time that you and others in this room woke up to the fact that we are inflicting misery on millions of people through unemployment, through poverty, through a loss of democracy, and that it is an error to try and keep countries trapped inside the euro prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent proposal is that Greece should write down her debts by 50% and remain a member of the eurozone. Surely, Mr Juncker, if that happens, the same would happen to Portugal and Ireland too. Do you think it is possible for any Member State of the euro to write down their debts and stay a member of the eurozone?</p>

I then explained how if, as a finance minister, one was asked on a Friday afternoon, before the financial markets had closed, whether there was to be a meeting in Brussels on Saturday or Sunday to adjust the EMS, then one could not tell the truth.

I would like to find out, Mr Juncker, if you would advise the countries which are not members of the euro area to form something like a ‘Non-Eurogroup’, so that dialogue between the Eurogroup and the ‘Non-Eurogroup’ would be more balanced, to mitigate any negative consequences of the intergovernmental approach and to progress towards a more Community-like approach?</p>

As you know, a fortnight ago, the Greek Government passed and adopted new, additional measures to safeguard the implementation of the programme.

There have been two very important developments today: firstly, the Greek Minister for Finance has stated that the Troika will return to Greece within a week to continue its work, which was suddenly suspended on 1 September, and, secondly, the Labour Institute of the General Confederation of Greek Workers has presented its report on unemployment. Real unemployment in Greece is estimated this year to be in the order of 22% to 23%, levels not seen in Greece since the beginning of the 1960s.</p>
      <p sl="el">This raises two questions: firstly, why did the Troika leave, Mr President? Can you at least confirm that it will return to Greece within the week? Secondly, given that the medium-term fiscal strategy and the memorandum of understanding make provision for unemployment of less than 15% this year, 14.6% to be precise, are you worried that unemployment has been derailed?

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, to answer your second question, obviously, the level of unemployment in Greece is of concern to me, as it also is in some other countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The overall average unemployment rate in Europe, which stands at 10%, is not a level that we should ever have to accept. It is a million miles from full employment. According to the Treaty, one of the objectives of the European Union is to ensure full employment in Europe. Obviously, this is not the case at the present time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the deteriorating unemployment situation in Greece, I blame the fact that the recession is greater and deeper there than what the Troika estimated last time round when it released the fifth tranche to Greece.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not a member of the Troika and am therefore not responsible for its movements. I believe, however, that the Troika left Athens because there were difficulties reaching an agreement between what the Troika thought Greece had to do and what the Greek Government was willing to do. Since then, the gap in their viewpoints has narrowed. My understanding is that the Troika will be back in Athens tomorrow or the day after.</p>

Yet these measures are already in force here. Widespread use of short-time work schemes, that is all very well, but we introduced this the moment the crisis hit Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So we cannot say that the US programme is any more ambitious or different than ours. The US is moving towards the elements of the programme which has always been European.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the rest, since you are concerned about German taxpayers’ understanding, Ms Merkel and others will need to explain to our German friends that Europe is like a tango between the solidarity of some and the stability of others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think I can say that I know Germany well. I am there often enough, I often give speeches there – ones that are not always interrupted – and I have noticed that, when you explain things properly, in a way that is understandable and engaging, when you are not making excuses for everything that you have done, most German citizens have no problem in understanding. They need to be told the truth. From the beginning, you need to explain your point of view. The Germans are not egotistical. Like the rest of us, they want to understand and it is true that our teaching abilities are underdeveloped, but we are learning.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you are right to say that those in favour of the Community approach and those in favour of the intergovernmental approach are being played off against each other. However, when you say that the Community method is the answer, I do not completely agree on one level. How do you see the crisis being managed using the Community method? That is the question being put to us. It is not about simply going back to the good old method of making the laws, leaving it to the Commission to propose and the two others to decide.</p>

The good old method is unworkable in times of emergency when speed is of the essence. What I meant by saying that we need to rediscover the virtues of the Community method included that part of the scope that is possible – the Community method that you refer to.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that, when the Community method does not have the instruments to resolve an urgent problem, we need to be guided by community spirit. The Community method creates a community spirit which must apply even when the Community method does not have enough working tools.</p>

      <p sl="de">However, a minor change to the Treaty is required in order for the ESM to be adopted, as well as ratification by the parliaments in all Member States, requiring a two-thirds majority in my own country’s case. The Austrian Greens are the only opposition party in Austria that intend voting in favour here, but only if the ESM is improved. The fact is that, at present, the ESM is a half-baked idea, hence the reason for the package deal. The Austrian Greens in the National Council have written to the Austrian Government, and to you, to say that we will only vote in favour if an orderly debt forgiveness and rescheduling process is put in place, if credible steps are taken in the direction of a financial transaction tax and the introduction of Eurobonds.</p>

      <p sl="de">However much I favour a transaction tax and however much I am attracted by the words I hear, I nevertheless remain unconvinced that it will be possible to incorporate all of these elements in the ESM Treaty in one fell swoop.

We accept that, if it means that we are to be the guinea pigs that demonstrate how this economic governance will ultimately work, but I would like to pass on to you verbatim something said to me by a Greek fisherman. ‘Madam,’ he said, ‘they are all sadists in the European Parliament. Every day we suffer a Chinese water torture, every day the Greek people hear that today, tomorrow, next week, Europe will tell us what is to become of us. We are a very insecure nation’.

      <p sl="fr">I want our Greek friends to understand that consolidating Greek public finances is essential. I want your citizens to understand that we cannot fight debt with debt. I want the Greeks to understand that they cannot continue like this and that, apart from owing them a historical debt of gratitude, we also understand that we have a current duty to Greece to show our support for the Hellenic Republic, provided that the Greek authorities agree to carry the burden.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for economic governance or economic government, I repeat that we need to agree the content. In the next few months, I would like the euro area or the EU, as such, to have adopted a programme for economic governance which will introduce the various dimensions of economic government and governance step by step.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we were preparing for the advent of the single currency, as part of the Maastricht Treaty, we did so in stages. There were three stages in introducing the euro because we were going into an unknown area. Economic government is another area which we do not know all the ins and outs of, and I therefore want us to establish a programme in stages that citizens can understand, that are put together so that governments, national parliaments, Community bodies, including the European Parliament and public opinion, understand the pace at which we are going.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, would you not agree that Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it possible to adopt legislative measures for the euro area within the scope of the economic policy competences given to the EU by the treaties?

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Juncker, I would like to return to matters concerning Greece. It appears that this year, Greek budgetary expenditure will increase by over 8%, which means that the country’s deficit will increase by the same amount. Therefore, there is no room for savings, which form the basis for the rescue package which has been accepted. The Greek Minister for Finance recently admitted that the main cause of his country’s problems in implementing the accepted reforms is the lack of an effective state apparatus and tax administration system. Taking into consideration the fact that the creation of an appropriate system could take several years, I would like to ask if there is any chance at all of success for the Greek rescue package.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As for the rest, and as for Greece, it will not have escaped your notice that, on 21 July, the European Council decided to offer Greece a whole range, a whole host of measures of administrative assistance. There is a task force in Greece, divided between Brussels and Greece, which works, in particular, on the important matter of mobilising the financial resources for the Structural Funds. All euro area Member States have proposed providing Greece with their own administrative know-how, particularly with regard to tax collection – a massive weak link in the Greek administration. We are therefore more than willing to provide all the support and assistance that Greece might need.</p>

These investments could be made by private investors.

I would be very happy with a synergy between public, bank and other resources organised by the European Investment Bank and private capital, which would target investments at the more underprivileged regions of Europe today. I would also like these investments to be increasingly innovative and serve the ambitions that the European Union developed elsewhere, in particular, in the field of supplying alternative energy resources and improving mobility networks within the southern part of the euro area and within EU Member States: Bulgaria, Romania and others, where additional efforts need to be made in terms of mobility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this year’s UN General Assembly took place at a time of enormous change and growing tensions in the world. The combination of the economic crisis, the Arab Spring and the stalled Middle East peace process creates a strong mix. I believe that Europe has to respond to the challenges, both at home and in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, at your request, I am focusing my remarks on two issues: the Middle East peace process and the Arab Spring. I did, however, just want to say to Honourable Members that during the week in New York, I met with Ministers from Russia, China, the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico – our strategic partners – and participated in many key events: on counter-terrorism, and a very important women’s event led by the President of Brazil.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to turn first to the Middle East peace process. As Honourable Members know, I visited the region seven times this year, each time with a single purpose: to promote a negotiated settlement of the conflict and to demonstrate the importance of Europe’s role. Over the summer period, I have worked with the Quartet envoys and with the Arab League, and have been in discussions with the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority, together with Prime Minister Fayyad.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that these efforts have succeeded in demonstrating that the European Union does have a role; that we are a player and a payer, with our financial commitment matched by our political strength. For too long, we have been on the sidelines of the peace process. I have worked to achieve a greater role for Europe because I believe we are ideally placed as a friend of both parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have said before that my vision for the European External Action Service is in a conflict prevention and resolution approach. We need to put that vision into practice. The dividends of peace are crucial for the future stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prior to arriving in New York, I participated in Cairo at the Arab League Follow-Up Committee discussions as we considered how best to support our objectives: two states; peace and security for both. Exploratory talks with the Palestinians, with the Israelis and with Jordanian leaders at the end of August led me to believe that the way forward was to put together what became known in New York as ‘the package’, various actions with the key objective of getting the Israelis and Palestinians together in talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">During my September visit, it became clear that a Quartet statement and possible General Assembly resolution, in addition to what President Abbas was seeking to do, could be part of such a package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I met with many Arab leaders and was impressed by the desire they stated to end the conflict and their wish to bring stability and normality against a backdrop of potential unrest sparked by lack of progress. I believe this is also understood by Israeli leaders, who are fearful of seeing their country facing great uncertainty in the region, and fear for their own security.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have impressed upon all I have met that this is a time to seek peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians on the basis, as we know very well in this House, of a negotiated agreement that will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state as a core element of that agreement, and end the occupation that is so detrimental to the development of both peoples.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United Nations speeches of President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu certainly differed in rhetoric, but they both spoke about a desire for peace. Both speeches when you read them back focused on the need to go to negotiations and the wish to end the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">In New York, we worked to achieve a Quartet response to this, immediately calling on both parties to enter into negotiations within four weeks, to agree on the issue of territory and security within three months, and to have made substantial progress within six months, with an agreement by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do expect both sides to come forward and agree to negotiations. I believe that the European Union, including this Parliament, should play a central role in that process. We are well placed to do so, we are well respected in the region, and I believe we should have that commitment to stay closely involved, which, as I have made clear to all that I have met, I intend to do personally.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Quartet has called for parties to refrain from provocative actions if negotiations are really going to resume and, more importantly, be effective. It is therefore with deep regret that I have learnt today about the decision to advance in the plans for settlement expansion in East Jerusalem, with new housing units in Gilo. This plan should be reversed. Settlement activity threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution and runs contrary to the Israeli stated commitment to resume negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also called for a donors’ conference to support further the impressive achievements of the Palestinian Authority’s state building and we will consult on additional steps that will quickly lead to greater independence and sovereignty for the Palestinians over their affairs. Facilitating Palestinian trade is essential to support state building and develop the economy. We propose concrete actions to open our markets to Palestinian agricultural and fishery products. I am glad that earlier today, the European Parliament voted in favour of this important agreement, for which I thank you.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gaza, too, remains a priority. As I have always said, the crossings must be opened to allow the flow of humanitarian aid, imports, exports and people. We need to enable children to go to school and ordinary people, and the younger generation in particular, to get on with and build the lives that they would want to have. I will continue to work to allow the economic recovery of Gaza, while, of course, remaining committed to ensuring the security of the people of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second issue today is the Arab Spring. Since the demonstrations in Tunisia, the Arab Spring has touched every Arab state in the region. It is an event of truly historic proportions that will shape not only the future of that region, but our own future too. It is a revolution based on values: on justice, dignity and freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s response to these events will speak more than any form of rhetoric about our real commitment to democratic principles. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build deep and lasting democracy and prosperity in the Southern Mediterranean. Doing so will require vision, perseverance and a team effort from all of Europe’s institutions. I look at my partner in this effort, Stefan Füle, as I speak! We need to stay focused and committed. The scale of the challenge requires a joined-up EU response. What we do on trade and mobility is as important to the overall success of our strategy as what we do on election monitoring and supporting development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Six months on, we still need to match words with delivery, and that is why I believe we need to re-energise the process. Last May, I set out here my vision for North Africa and the Middle East, a vision of deep-rooted democracy, and the benefits of development that will come to it. My priority is delivery. After the revolutions, we face that growing sense of impatience and uncertainty, so we have to translate good intentions into results and assistance on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">The process of change was never going to be easy and never going to be fast. Real change takes time and will be measured in years, not seasons. Our response, which began with the communication of 8 March, is built on the need to acknowledge past mistakes and to listen without imposing. We are doing exactly that, and it requires perseverance and sustained commitment. Success should translate into what I have called ‘deep democracy’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Political transformation will only succeed with economic opportunity. In the short term the uprisings were motivated by economic hardships, and have perhaps made those hardships even more severe in some places. There is no single template for our support, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’. We have to develop tailor-made policies in response to the needs identified by each country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Engagement with Arab partners, particularly with the Arab League, is essential. We are working ‘with them, not at them’, which is why I was a prime mover in the establishment of the Cairo Group. But we are in a new era where dialogue between governments is not enough. Success requires engagement with and between societies. The European Parliament is unique in what it can offer to those in search of democracy in Tunisia and beyond, particularly now that constituent assemblies will become the key institutional actors. Building and sustaining political parties is essential. The experience in this House is unmatched.</p>
      <p sl="en">In New York, I participated in a high-level event on women in politics. I firmly believe that the continued central role of women in the Arab Spring is a key test of the strength and the extent of the changes. Women, together with the younger generation, were instrumental in the protests that toppled repressive regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, and they must remain central to shaping the reforms that follow. Deep and lasting democracy has to be for all people, not just one gender.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was an encouraging signal on Sunday from perhaps an unexpected place, Saudi Arabia, when King Abdullah announced that women, as from next year, will be appointed to the Shura Council. They will also be able to vote and stand as candidates in elections in four years’ time. Many of us would have hoped to see women voting in this Thursday’s ballot, but this decision, if properly implemented, marks an initial step in advancing women’s participation in the political, economic and social life of that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The future of the Arab Spring depends on Tunisia and Egypt becoming success stories. What happens there as they move to elections and build a system of civil rights and democratic values will send messages everywhere else. Time is important: expectations are high, and we need to see visible results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tomorrow, I travel to Tunisia with Stefan; we have set up a new EU task force for that country; it is taking place at a key moment to show our support just three weeks ahead of the first truly democratic elections, on 23 October. An EU Election Observation Mission is already on the ground. Given the highly political nature of the event and the key contribution from the European Parliament to support countries in transition, I have invited a delegation from this House to join me in Tunis tomorrow. I am extremely grateful that members of this House have agreed to come with me and participate fully in the work of the task force. I hope that this will be a model which we will replicate again in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The purpose of the task force is to focus on some of the key issues which will have a direct impact on the lives of Tunisians: business, investment and the economy; social development and democracy. It will be unique in that it brings together not only our Tunisian partners but also our international financial institutions and private sector representatives. It will be the occasion for strong political messages, with the opening of negotiations for a new privileged partnership which reflects our shared ambition. It will also be an opportunity to better coordinate European and international efforts to focus on faster, more effective support. This tailor-made approach, based on decentralised and coordinated use of all our instruments, will then be used with other countries in transition to better identify needs and accelerate support.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Egypt, where we expect the interim authorities will soon confirm the date of elections, it is urgent that the ruling military council continues to engage with political representatives and civil society to get a new electoral law for the new democratic era. Egyptian authorities have declined European and other international offers of involvement in direct election observation, but we will be working with them on other urgent measures, through the Instrument for Stability, to enhance the capacity of Egypt’s High Electoral Commission and help judges and poll workers to manage and effectively oversee these first free, fair and democratic elections, as well as laying the basis for the organisation of future elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that many in this House are personally involved in strengthening the work of political parties in Egypt and I will, if I may, pay tribute to that work. I had great pleasure in meeting people who are engaged directly and I think it is well understood in Egypt how much this House is engaging there.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some other countries in the region, the authorities have sought to respond to calls for greater freedoms by intensifying their reform processes, some of which were already under way before the Arab Spring. In Morocco, a new Constitution has been developed and approved overwhelmingly. This promises increased separation of powers and greater public accountability as well as improved respect for human rights. These are important, but they now need fast and sustained implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Jordan, the Lower House endorsed 41 constitutional amendments, which included the establishment of a constitutional court and the creation of an independent commission overseeing elections. The new election laws and the political parties’ law will be debated by their Parliament in October. We urge them to continue with their reform, and we pay tribute to the work which is going on to try and achieve that within Jordan.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of both Morocco and Jordan, we will continue to build on the Advanced Status. In Morocco, we are developing a new action plan focusing on the reform agenda. We will shortly launch a mobility partnership, and we will step up our financial and technical cooperation. I look to his House to help play its part in supporting the moves which are going on in both those countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to accelerate ongoing trade negotiations and prepare mandates for deep and comprehensive free trade agreements in Morocco, Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia. Approval by Parliament to the EU-Morocco Agreement on Liberalisation Measures on Agricultural Products, Fish and Fishery Products will send a signal of our desire to deepen our relationship in practical ways to the benefit of their people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We recognise today that fighting continues in Sirte, Bani Walid and a few other pockets of resistance, but Libya is transitioning fast from a crisis to the creation of a democracy. Last week in New York, I took part in the Friends of Libya meeting, where we were able to deliver a message of strong, continuing commitment. President Jalil has pledged to build a society based on tolerance and reconciliation and to uphold the principles of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The National Transitional Council and the international community also have to establish control over the large stock of weapons that the previous regime had amassed, to prevent them falling into the wrong hands. All this and more is essential for their transition.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to our office in Benghazi, our new office in Tripoli is working closely with other partners under the coordination of the UN to determine the needs there. We know that Libya is a rich country, but we also know that they need support to develop their economy back to where it was; to help bring back the workforce which left Libya at the time of the crisis; to ensure that they are able to develop transparent ways of dealing with the resources that they will be receiving and the return of assets; to make sure that they have support in the security sector and to make sure that they are able to develop the links that they want to see, for example, the trade links they want to develop further with Europe, and the links which can help them develop a civil society which deserves that name. We are preparing projects to support civil society and women in Libya in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I also take note of Anna Gomes’ excellent suggestions to organise a visit of Libyan officials and civil society to the upcoming Spanish elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Syria and Yemen, we face crisis situations. I do not have to tell any honourable Member here of the brutal regime in Syria that remains unwilling to listen to its people and to change. We are pursuing our double-track approach by stepping up measures designed to undermine the regime’s support and, internationally, to achieve further isolation of the Syrian leadership. We have made many rounds of sanctions, and I was delighted to see in the Financial Times this morning the recognition that those sanctions are having an effect. But we are very clear in our message to the people of Syria, and during August, all 27 Member States joined in to send a very strong message that it was time that President Assad stood aside and enabled the people of Syria to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Madam President, a word about Yemen. We have been strongly supporting the work of the Gulf Cooperation Council. You know that the unexpected return on Friday of President Saleh led to a very coordinated response out of New York from the GCC, the Arab League, the European Union, the United States and now the Security Council, all calling for violence to stop and for a rapid and concrete transfer of power. Nobody will be satisfied with another open-ended promise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I have tried to cover so much in this short presentation of the work which we are doing and the understanding that we have for the region. I look forward very much to your resolution and I continue to thank you for the support and advice that you have given as we move forward with what, I believe, is an increasingly clear strategy in uncertain times.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope for real and sustained progress both in Israel and Palestine, across North Africa and the wider Middle East. Further steps were taken in New York last week. We have to work together and continue to engage with all parties to make sure that we do have real cause for celebration when the General Assembly meets next September.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a balanced approach to the problem should be based on three premises: the State of Israel’s legitimate desire for security, the frustration of the Palestinian people and the blockage in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this, Baroness Ashton, comes at a time when international attention is focused on the Arab Spring, at a time when the United States is hampered by its electoral commitments, at a time when the government of Israel is divided and has almost no room for manoeuvre and when Palestinian radicals are increasingly showing their pleasure with the lack of results.</p>
      <p sl="es">Given this situation, Baroness Ashton, the question is very simple: what can we do as the European Union? In this context, I would like to tell you that Parliament, which has criticised you so many times – and I have been the first to do so – must acknowledge your efforts to seek solutions in Cairo, Ramallah, Jerusalem, New York and Washington, and your calls for the European Union to speak with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="es">In politics, Madam President, whatever is impossible is wrong. In the face of the United States’ announced veto in the Security Council, the President of France, as in the Georgia crisis in 2008 and this year in Libya, has proposed a compromise solution, which is the Vatican solution.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, what view should we take of this initiative? Do you think it can be supported by the Member States? What can the European Union do to make the Quartet’s solution acceptable to the Palestinians?</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, if the European Union wants to be relevant and not decline in significance on the international stage, it must take a step forwards. It must move in the right direction and rouse itself from its lethargy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am not saying this because of you, Baroness Ashton. You have done a lot and you have done it well, but you must propose solutions that are concrete, tangible, with defined costs and a precise timetable.</p>
      <p sl="es">You need to do this – and this is the hard part – without impinging on or harming the dignity of either side, while also recognising the inalienable rights that will enable one side to live in peace and security and the others to form their own state.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, allow me to return to what happened at the General Assembly in New York. You only touched briefly on these matters and I would simply like to tell you today that my group supports President Abbas’s legitimate request to the United Nations (UN). It is a very simple statement.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I have more or less said everything. We also regret that it has taken so long for this request to be made to the UN and we hope that Europe will finally succeed in speaking clearly and with one voice on this difficult subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lady Ashton, you should not suppose that the simple phrase ‘We support President Abbas’s request’ met with instant acceptance within the political groups. There were fears of a misunderstanding with Israel, whose security has always been a must for us. Fears, too, that the Palestinian initiative might fail in the Security Council, potentially resulting in an outbreak of street violence in the Arab countries and perhaps economic sanctions against the Palestinian Authority, or pressure from the United States. All of which made this a difficult decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet what eventually carried the day was a kind of honesty and political courage on the part of MEPs. Yes, the Palestinians are entitled to membership. Sixty-three years after the same General Assembly recognised the State of Israel, 12 years after the Berlin Declaration promised to recognise the Palestinian state in due course, the time has come. The time has come to support those in Palestine who have opted for peace, negotiation and the creation of viable institutions. The time has come because Palestine is being whittled away. It is no longer the Palestine defined in 1947, nor in the Oslo Accords in 1993. It has even changed in the last few years. The Israeli Government’s policy of presenting faits accomplis, with settlements, the usurpation of agricultural land, the wall – all of this is consuming Palestine from within. There is no time to waste.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This very day, the Israeli Government has decided to build 1 100 housing units in Gilo, which will soon render a two-state solution impossible. The time has come. The Arab Spring has given rise to so much hope that it would be unthinkable for Europe to tell the Palestinians: ‘This spring is not for you. Hold on. In due time, as it says in the Berlin Declaration, your time will come’. Palestinians are dying today having never known anything but occupation. For all these reasons, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is today unreservedly supporting Mahmoud Abbas’s request to the UN. Let their courage – some have lived through troubled times – let their courage inspire you, Baroness Ashton, when you defend our position to the European governments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are times when European values and commitments have to take precedence.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian Authority has caused a real stir with it candidature for full membership of the United Nations, as fine words no longer suffice. In all likelihood, all the Member States of the UN, including, of course, the Member States of the European Union, will have to determine their position on this issue in the near future, namely within a few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The United States has already said that it will use its veto in the Security Council. Israel is labelling this initiative a unilateral act that breaches the Oslo Accords. When it comes to unilateral initiatives, I would like to observe, on behalf of my entire group, that the building of settlements in occupied territories, the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian houses and the construction of a wall on Palestinian territory are also unilateral acts, and acts that, furthermore, contravene international law.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="nl">However, I am not here to point the finger. On behalf of my group, Baroness Ashton, I call on you and all the Member States to work in concert to ensure, through contact and discussions, that, by the end of the current session of the UN General Assembly at the latest, the Palestinians are able to obtain a better – in fact, the best possible – status within that organisation. We, too, believe that the Palestinians have a right to their own state. We also support you in your efforts to bring about a lasting peace accord between Israel and Palestine by the end of next year. The internationally accepted parameters of such an accord are well known: two states living side by side in peace, that recognise each other’s right to exist based on the 1967 borders, which can only be altered on the basis of a mutual accord, and with Jerusalem as the shared capital. There is also a need for a humane resolution to be found to the question of the refugees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If this were not such a serious subject, I would point out at this juncture that the Belgian Members of this House, me included, are well aware that knowing the parameters of a problem is far from the same thing as being able to find easy solutions to it. Time is pressing, however. The changed political circumstances in various countries in the Middle East necessitate a rapid solution, and that is without even going into the human suffering that has been plaguing Israel and Palestine for so long. High Representative, we Belgians are working hard on finding a solution, and I hope that you, too, will succeed in that vein. We wish you every success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ECR Group is indeed in favour of a negotiated two-state Israel-Palestine solution, on the basis of the 1967 borders, with land for peace swaps, and agreed on by both parties under the Quartet principles. President Abbas’s unilateral bid before the UN General Assembly is rushed and will do nothing to change the situation on the ground. A lasting solution can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, which must, for its own part, stop the expansion of settlements on occupied territories. Moreover, statehood cannot be safely considered while Palestinian Gaza is governed by an EU-banned terrorist organisation, Hamas. It must also be remembered that Palestine is largely dependent on foreign aid, not only from the US and the European Union, but also from Israel, from whom it receives water and electricity, as well as assistance in collecting taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Advocating unilaterally a recognised Palestinian Authority state without the UN Security Council’s approval, and only that of the General Assembly’s, risks sanctions from the US and Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister has, to his credit, now, without any preconditions, called for a return to direct talks. The ideal next step would be for the Palestinians, via the Palestinian Authority Government, to do likewise in order to achieve their state.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we need to be clear today. For many Palestinians – and I have just come back from visiting Ramallah and the Palestinian universities – the two-state solution is no longer on the agenda. The Israelis are not willing to accept it. Let us not delude ourselves: Israel is making a two-state solution increasingly impossible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are right to argue for two States, but we need to appreciate the Palestinians’ frustration. There is one thing that I do not understand. Like the Socialists, we support President Abbas’s request to the United Nations (UN). The words that he used: ‘There is not a State too many in the Middle East, but there is one State missing,’ imply that the State of Israel is legitimate but that a Palestinian state is needed. This is a wording that we can all sign up to. What I fail to understand, Baroness Ashton, is why you have come here to say that you regret Israel’s announcement today that it will be building a further 1 100 housing units. You could at least condemn that decision. Do not express regret. Say that it is not possible. Make that clear.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Then, even though we are in favour of immediate recognition for the Palestinian state, you should at least tell the Israelis that if they continue to build, you will push for the European States to agree to recognise the Palestinian state forthwith. Give them a taste of their own medicine. They say that they want to negotiate, but at the same time they are continuing the occupation. Take political action, Lady Ashton. Politics is not a prayer and a hope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are hundreds of thousands of people in Israel today who are opposed to Mr Netanyahu’s policy. The European Union, and we here today, need to be honest. Mr Tannock, let us not be cynical.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The State of Israel was unilaterally recognised by the UN in 1947, which was only right. It was right. There were no negotiations with the Arab nations. It was the right thing to do. Mr Tannock, you tell us that Israel is supporting the Palestinians by supplying water. In reality, Israel is stealing Palestinian water and selling it back to them. Do you call that support? Let us move away from this cynical attitude in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If, today, we do not all stand and say to the Israelis: ‘You understand peace to mean peace for Israel, to mean that Israel can have a place in the Middle East and even dream of a United States of the Middle East where everyone has their place’, then Israel will not understand that it is in its best interest to have a Palestinian state. Baroness Ashton, you need to tell the Israelis that they will not find other Palestinian representatives like Mr Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad and that although Hamas is currently opposed to Mr Abbas’s initiative, that is because the party knows that this initiative is the only way to have two states in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that your position is too weak. You have not said at any point how you will compel the Israelis to negotiate. This is an implausible fiction. They say that they want unconditional negotiations because, on the ground, the conditions are being changed, the occupation is continuing. Tell the Israelis that either they stop the settlements straight away – stop the colonisation and construction – or the European Union will support recognition for the Palestinian state now, at the 66th meeting of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you do not do this, Baroness Ashton, you will find that there will not be any negotiations in six months’ time. A year down the line, we will be in the same position as we are now. You will come back here and say: ‘The Israelis and Palestinians need to understand that negotiation is the only way to achieve peace’. They will achieve peace, Lady Ashton, if we tell the Israelis that when it comes to defending the State of Israel, they have gone too far and enough is enough. If we take that tone with them, you will find that things will change.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the positions, policy, practices and action in general of the United States, the European Union and, in particular, certain Member States of the European Union, are strengthening Israeli aggression and fly in the face of the right and longing of the Palestinian people, the will of the people for the immediate recognition of an independent Palestinian state which belongs to the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union and the governments of its Member States, at this critical stage in the fight by the Palestinian people, are being judged by their actions, not by their hypocritical pronouncements, evasiveness and wishful thinking. They are being judged for putting the offender and the victim on an equal footing and for reinforcing Israeli intransigence. We call on the peoples of the area and on the peoples of the world in general to take a decisive stand against the games being played at the United Nations, to fight to eliminate the pressure being exerted on the Palestinian people by the US, the European Union and Israel and their imperialist allies, to demand that the governments take up a clear position in their stand and vote in the Security Council and at the UN General Assembly in favour of the immediate and unconditional recognition of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with its capital in East Jerusalem which is a full member of the UN.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, following the Palestinian propaganda offensive in the General Assembly of the United Nations last week, a return to the harsh reality of Israeli-Palestinian relations is inevitable. One manifestation of that reality is a fundamental lack of a credible Palestinian peace partner for the Jewish state of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is, first and foremost, evidenced by the fact that Mahmoud Abbas did not speak for Hamas in New York last Friday, nor did he act on Hamas’s behalf when submitting the Palestinian application for UN membership. It would appear that, despite the so-called reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, political relations between the two parties are not going smoothly. While the European Union is currently showing commitment, in particular, to democratisation and fair elections in the Arab world, what we are seeing on the west bank of the Jordan is precisely the opposite. What legitimacy does the Palestinian Authority still have after the third successive postponement of presidential, parliamentary and local elections?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fundamental reason for Israel’s lack of confidence in Mahmoud Abbas as a peace partner is, above all, his systematic refusal to publicly implement the two-state solution of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian one.

However, sometimes the Members of this House should consider the people who are affected by political decisions. Just this once, I would like to quote from literature. I do not know which of you has read the book by Amos Oz entitled ‘A Tale of Love and Darkness’. In this book, Amos Oz describes a scene from the year 1947 that moved me very much. The vote was being held in the United Nations in November 1947 and all of the people of Israel were listening in on the radio – there was no television at the time – to see how the decision would go. He describes the jubilation that broke out throughout Israel when the decision was taken and the majority of votes were in favour of Israel. Then Amos Oz corrects himself and writes: actually not throughout Israel, but just in the Jewish part of Israel. So what about the others?</p>
      <p sl="de">The year 1947 has already been mentioned here. I constantly find myself asking: how can anyone justify the fact that the state of Israel was founded in 1947 – thank God! – and yet we still do not have a state of Palestine, even though the decision at the time was that two states should be founded? Is there anyone in this House who would deny the Palestinians the joy that the Israelis rightly experienced in 1947? I fail to understand this to this very day. This is not a question of propaganda, or terrorism, it is a matter of people’s lives. Sometimes people ask what is the benefit of statehood? The Jews in the Israeli state, who received the news of the United Nations vote with such jubilation, benefited a great deal from this decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">All I have to say to you, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, is that I would like to see the Palestinians having an opportunity to experience the same joy, preferably as quickly as possible: they also deserve a state of their own after many decades of struggle and strife. The Palestinians have a right to a state of their own, just as Jews have a right to the state of Israel. This should be our common objective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, some excellent work has been done in a difficult field. I am a little surprised by Mr Cohn-Bendit, who spent five minutes berating you, describing your role as that of a blackmailer and calling on you to resolve the problems immediately, before leaving the Chamber. He could at least have waited to hear what you had to say in reply.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that some excellent work has been done in this field. There is one thing that we must not forget: what were our fears? We were afraid that the European Union would once again create an impression that our Member States would not pull together, just as we failed to act cohesively in the war in Iraq or as we are doing now in Libya. Germany and France had already made their positions clear in individual statements.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the contrary, the European Union is pulling together. You have earned the trust of both sides in the region, the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a diplomatic feat in itself and it is true to say that we can only play a constructive role through trust. It is also true that we, the European Union, can only play a constructive role if our Member States are united. Both of these points are on a good footing thanks to your work. Overall, you have done a good job.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three more important things I would like to mention: we want a united European Union – you are making good progress in this direction. As Parliament stated in its resolution, we want a negotiated solution in the United Nations. We do not want a vote with winners and losers. We regard this as vitally important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we must have a timetable. We say that the Palestinians should get their upgrade during the 66th General Assembly, in other words, they must be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should allow the Palestinians this moment of joy, Mr Swoboda. However, I should say, whenever reference is made to 1947, that immediately afterwards, in 1948, Israel found itself under attack from all its Arab neighbours. If we achieve recognition for Palestine as a peaceful state and secure borders for the state of Israel, then this will be a reason to celebrate for the Palestinians, for the Israelis and for us here in Europe who played a constructive role, thanks to your efforts.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam Ashton, in my opinion, the unilateral step made by Mr Abbas last week was not that clever, nor did the Middle East quartet urge him to refrain from it without reason. That unilateral step will not bring us any closer to peace. Quite the opposite. We should not be heading in that direction just as a tactic to put pressure on each other.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is essential, though, is that we return to the negotiating table without delay, which is what you have rightly been working towards. We support you in those efforts. Israel has demonstrated to you that it is going to take the negotiations seriously. Mr Lieberman has said that he wants to return to the table to resume the talks. I call upon you to make that happen as early as tomorrow! We have to get back to the negotiating table; it is only there that we can make agreements and achieve peace and real results. Peace is vitally important for the parties in the Middle East and for the world as a whole. I would like to hear from you what the chances are of a speedy return to negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the UN considers Palestine’s application for full state membership, I would join the many others across Europe and beyond in urging the EU and the EU Member States to support the Palestinian request.</p>
      <p sl="en">Talks so far have failed. Of course, peace can only be achieved through negotiation. The recognition of the state of Palestine could lead to a freeze on the building of illegal settlements on the West Bank. It could lead to the end of the occupation. That is the way to ensure that further talks take place and that a two-state solution will be possible in the future. I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit on the need for a stronger response to new settlement building.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Palestinians have the right to be recognised as a state and that means that they would have full rights to participate in all international agreements and treaties. Amnesty International has raised concerns that the EU is promoting a compromise which would prevent recourse to the International Criminal Court. This would undermine both the ICC’s credibility and the principle of equal access to justice and reparation for all people. I hope that this is not the case and I would like to ask Baroness Ashton for her response on this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, there is one fact that has not been mentioned: the majority of the Israeli people, the majority of Palestinians and the majority of representatives from the states of the world support Mahmoud Abbas’s proposal that Palestine should become the 194th member of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Can our Parliament and you yourself, Baroness Ashton, continue to congratulate ourselves here in the calm and the warm, on what is being called the Arab Spring and yet go on prevaricating over recognising the Palestinian state? Any further prevarication is essentially playing for time to crush the very idea of a Palestinian state.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This time, we must not allow ourselves to be distracted. Those here who are calling this afternoon for the immediate resumption of direct negotiations are trying to conceal the fact that this situation has gone on for decades with no resolution, that the United States is the only one calling the shots, and that both the context and the terminology used are totally biased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, all discussions about Palestine refer only to occupied territories. This implies that the territories could be discussed and disputed for ever and that it is up to the occupied to prove that they have a right to be there. This terminology is very different to ‘occupied country’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely important political time, an historic moment, even. A clear and unambiguous resolution from our Parliament in support of Mahmoud Abbas’s proposal would send a clear and unambiguous signal.</p>

We welcome the Arab Spring, in so far as it aims to create conditions for democratisation, the restoration of respect and human rights and commonly acceptable ideas in general. However, I fear that the main issue that is keeping the situation in the Middle East on the boil is progress in relations between Iran and the West, the Arab-Israeli conflict and Islamic fundamentalism, the fundamentalism which Turkish neo-Ottomanism is trying to exploit. We support ideas and I consider that the Palestinians’ request should be evaluated within the framework of the UN in good faith and with consideration for both sides. In any event, we in the West must all understand that, as a problem, the Middle East needs a solution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past, we have often criticised Baroness Ashton, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission. I must say that I support and applaud what has been achieved with the Quartet under her leadership following the failure of the US to offer an effective response. We should try to support these achievements. Admittedly, there are differing opinions in this House regarding the desired final outcome. I do believe that we agree on one thing, however: we need a two-state solution with a viable Palestinian state and a secure Jewish state of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need movement on this question. I believe that everyone is trying to get things moving again, in order to get out of this stressful situation. I do not yet know whether this will work. However, if we were now to have a unilateral resolution, something that is not going to happen, leaving us with just a motion, because there is no majority in the Security Council and a veto would have to be overcome, then we would have reached a new deadlock that permits no further negotiation. There can be no resolution for any side; this would only be a short-term success for President Abbas, and would lead to further radicalisation. In the context of the Arab Spring in particular, this would put the US and others, including Member States of the European Union, in a difficult position. That is why I believe that the attempt to implement the proposals of the Quartet in relation to peace talks with a fixed schedule, clear conditions and clear objectives is the best approach and should receive our support. I also believe that we should adopt the path proposed by the Quartet in order to combine peace and security. In my opinion, this means that neither side should carry out violent actions, develop settlements or contribute in any way to conditions that make a resolution impossible. For this reason, Baroness Ashton, we wish you every success in the coming days.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are having another debate about the situation in the Middle East. It certainly will not be the last, but I believe that we are moving ever closer towards the solutions which will bring about peaceful coexistence between two peoples, two independent and equal states.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The request submitted by Palestine to be admitted as a full member of the UN is a step which entails great risks, but also opens up opportunities. I am sure that President Abbas would not have taken this step if he was not convinced that all the other moves and methods have been exhausted. I personally view this as a clear cry for help and no one can fail to hear this cry.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At a time when the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East are fighting for democracy and a better future for their countries, the Palestinians still do not have their own state. This, in itself, is enough to stir up discontent and new signs of radicalisation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I realise what a difficult position the international community is in. However, we should also accept this as a test of our ability to demonstrate determination and synergy. I would like to see the European Union’s Member States adopt a united stance in supporting the request submitted on behalf of the Palestinian people. The quicker we reach this position, the easier it will be for us to play a key role in the ensuing process.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In saying this, I do not want in any way for us to close our eyes to the serious risks posed to Israel’s security. However, I believe that inaction and postponing the negotiations will be increasingly costly to Israel itself.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the Palestinian people deserve formal recognition for their state at long last. I think that everyone in the Chamber is more or less agreed on the principle of supporting this legitimate demand. I would even go so far as to say that I can understand Mahmoud Abbas’s determination to take this to the bitter end. By getting his foot in the door of the Security Council, he has put the advocates of the peace process in an awkward position. Instead of a status quo, the United States, the Quartet and European Union are faced with an uncompromising yet almost inevitable request in the light of the current stalemate in the negotiations and the current Israeli Government’s reticence, to put it mildly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I am wholeheartedly convinced that after 60 years of conflict, there can be no short cut to peace now: peace will have to be negotiated between those same parties that have so long disputed the same land.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ten years ago, the Israeli Education Minister proposed including poems by Mahmoud Darwich in the Israeli school curriculum to ensure that future generations – who are now the current generation – would be able to see through the other’s eyes. It is now up to them to share their promised land in accordance with the timetable and to make urgent use of the window of opportunity as described in paragraph 2 of our resolution.</p>

If it is true, as Amnesty International is suggesting, that there is some idea that any negotiated peace might include excluding the International Criminal Court from any role in the future, then I think the European Union should rethink its position.

Baroness Ashton, you have expressed your view on how important the role of the EU has been, but I am more interested in practical results. On this I agree with what Mr Salafranca was saying. You say you want to get Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Well, yes, we all do. Israel says she has long been open to resuming negotiations, so what pressure have you brought to bear on the Palestinians?</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is the most significant financial supporter of the Palestinian Authority, with some EUR 2 billion over the past four years. What action is being taken to leverage that financial influence to bring the Palestinians to the conference table? Where is the return on this investment?</p>
      <p sl="en">The unilateral action by the Palestinian Authority at the United Nations is a deliberate provocation. Let us not forget, by the way, that Yasser Arafat declared Palestinian independence in October 1988. What is clear is that every time Israel has made a major concession, it has been greeted with further violence and seen as a sign of weakness. Look at what happened after the withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and after Netanyahu’s ten-month suspension of settlement construction in the West Bank in 2009.</p>

I believe that we are almost all agreed that it is good that the Palestinians have made such a lot of progress, and I think that there is broad support for the Palestinians having their own state. However, Israel needs help, too. In the newspaper Haaretz today, in addition to the terrible news of the many new settlements in Gilo, there is also an article that compares Israel to the Titanic. If no one stops Israel now, it will continue to sail towards disaster. It is therefore important for us to do more than just list everything that needs to be done. Israel will indeed go on and on and on – because no one is stopping the present government.</p>
      <p sl="da">The cry for help that I have heard from so many quarters is coming not least from the Israeli people, who are saying that this is all about to end in disaster. Therefore, Baroness Ashton, a great deal more ought to be done than simply to express regret at this, once again, disastrous decision regarding settlements. I also believe that much more can be done than to simply condemn this decision. We do, in fact, have the means to let Israel know that it is now time to stop if this entire situation is to end in anything other than violence and devastation.</p>

However, when we now hear that Israel intends building 1 100 new homes on the other side of the Green Line in Jerusalem, then a statement of regret is not sufficient. Instead, we must say that in this particular situation, such a move constitutes a provocation and must be condemned. In the end, Israel will achieve exactly what it does not want, namely, a unilateral recognition of Palestine. I would prefer to see a solution that derives from negotiations. However, if Israel continues to behave as it does at present, then we will see a unilateral recognition of Palestine. I must state that the Palestinians have the right to live in dignity and their dignity must be expressed in a state that is recognised by the international community. Both Israel and Palestine must live together in partnership, each with their own secure borders. We must, once and for all, stop vacillating in our response to the continued building of settlements.

Our vote tomorrow is critical. A vote for a Palestinian seat in the United Nations is a vote for Abbas’s non-violent diplomatic political strategy. It is a vote for a negotiated settlement, to which President Abbas has repeatedly said he is committed.</p>
      <p sl="en">As former Prime Minister Olmert said in the New York Times last week, the time for true leadership has come. Israel will not always find itself sitting across the table from Palestinian leaders, like Mr Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, who object to terrorism and want peace. Indeed future Palestinian leaders might abandon the idea of two states and take a one-state solution, making reconciliation impossible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister Netanyahu, on the other hand, calls for negotiations without preconditions while, at the same time, establishing concrete preconditions on the ground again today by ordering new building in East Jerusalem. This is clearly intended to prevent negotiations getting under way. Regretting these actions will not stop them, Baroness Ashton. We have to make it clear that these actions carry a cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the efforts you have made over the last while; I welcome, too, the Quartet’s statement of last week, limited though it is. However, its success depends on our building on the positive international engagement that the Abbas initiative has brought about.

Of course a solution has to be reached and of course it has to be reached by negotiation, but I just see the present Israeli Government putting in place more and more preconditions – like the preconditions we have heard about, such as building settlements. It is like asking the Palestinians to share the division of a pizza, while the Israelis continue to eat the Palestinian side of it. Then there is the new precondition of recognising Israel as a Jewish state – well we recognise states, but we do not recognise the character of states.</p>

      <p sl="en">Allow me to pick out just two issues. First, the EU has been called upon to help with border control. Actually, Gaddafi asked us exactly the same thing a year ago. I had opposed it in the past because there was no legal framework at all in Libya for migration. There still is not. All I ask you, Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle, is to ensure that we do not do one without the other – border control without any legal framework – that we do not train border control personnel in a legal vacuum. I think it would be a serious mistake if we were to do that now.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The time has come for the international community to say enough is enough. The time has come for the Arab League to get behind seeking a lasting and sensitive solution, by tabling viable solutions without delay and with limited timeframes. It is clear that the United States and Russia have yet to be part of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us start with Jerusalem: why not relaunch the initial idea of a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations and that functions, obviously, as the capital of both states?</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to borders, let us begin with those of 1967. Parcels of land should be exchanged in as far as is possible and consistent. Care should be taken to protect Israel, which is a crucial issue for the Jewish people; this could be done, for example, by stationing a UN peacekeeping force comprising US, European and Islamic forces on the banks of the River Jordan.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are 4.8 million refugees and they have the right to their dignity; to a future linked to land, preferably their own.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ever since the United Nations General Assembly agreed to create two states on the territory that formerly constituted the Palestine Mandate in 1947, we have never stopped waiting for that commitment to be realised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So how can we now accept the caution expressed in the speeches? In the light of this historic opportunity, how can we justify refusing to back President Abbas’s request fully? Let me remind you, Baroness Ashton, that sometimes caution can result in cowardice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore like to pay tribute to the courage and perseverance of one man, Mahmoud Abbas. He is the bearer of a legitimate hope, that of a people who have a right to a land. For those who object to the fact that this initiative could provoke an outbreak of violence, let me remind you that a few years ago, the suppression of a similar initiative fostered the Second Intifada.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My message is simple, Baroness Ashton: at the time of the Arab Spring, it is your duty and ours to support the Palestinian request to the hilt. The European Union boasts of having brought down a wall and of recognising states. It will be able to stand even prouder if it recognises that the Palestinians are also entitled to statehood.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the question the Palestinians are posing, not just to the Member States of the Security Council, not just to the nations of the United Nations (UN), but to all of us, is very simple: will the Palestinians – occupied, colonised – have the right to see the dignity of their state recognised by the UN? Yes or no? Without calling into question the existence of the state of Israel alongside Palestine, yes or no? A delayed or evasive response is an unworthy response. The Palestinians have the right to an answer from the European Union, too: yes or no?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, instead of accepting this type of continuous delay, whilst Israel pushes ahead with its settlements, what we should be doing is talking to Israeli society – to the 400 000 middle-class Israelis who have taken to the streets – and saying to them: ‘accept the state of Palestine now, accept peace now, and the European Union will take responsibility for everyone’s security, for everyone’s dignity, and for giving everyone access to the European Union’s markets, which is access to prosperity for everyone’. This is because Israeli civil society knows very well that the route down which Mr Netanyahu is taking them is an alleyway with no way out and no friends.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot continue with this fate of staying on the outside of historic occasions. A simple yes or no response, Lady Ashton: yes.</p>

      <p sl="it">We therefore hope that you are aware and can feel the support of Parliament and, as Mr Pöttering rightly said, we know what we want. We want an agreement based on the existence of two democratic and sovereign states, whose peoples can live within secure and internationally recognised borders. What we are still lacking are negotiations with clear dates and clear conclusions. All democratic countries know that peace will be achieved when the Palestinian state is created, but we also know that this can only come to pass through proper peace talks.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we have been waiting for decades now. It is high time that we nailed our colours to the mast and offered the Palestinians a genuine prospect of a stable and economically viable future. The only way that that can be achieved, however, is by starting with recognition. The Palestinian state should therefore be recognised because, by giving the Palestinian people recognition, we will also be giving them hope.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The clock has been ticking for many years. There is a time bomb of frustration which needs to be defused. I believe that, in the context of the Arab Spring and the rapid geopolitical changes in the region, this could create a momentum which could lead to lasting peace, because that is, obviously, what we all ultimately want to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Negotiations have to be resumed, of course, but I personally believe that the stronger of the two parties should make the first gesture by, for example, ceasing to build any more settlements. That could give the process a shot in the arm.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, let us be clear about one thing: the Palestinians have not exactly been keeping their intention to apply for recognition a secret. It is, therefore, regrettable that the international community did too little to anticipate it and that we waited as long as we did to find a solution that would force the parties back to the negotiating table.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We cannot respond to this request for justice with injustice. The situation that has persisted for many years in the Middle East is no longer acceptable and must end. We now need to call for a real solution, namely, the immediate resumption of negotiations with a strict timetable and based on the 1967 agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful Palestinian state is surely the best guarantee of Israel’s security. Baroness Ashton, I congratulate you on all your efforts, but we need to go further, because once again, the Member States of the European Union are sadly divided and do not have a common position. Unfortunately, some European governments are acting counter to the will of their citizens, the bulk of whom are in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state. As the elected representatives of those citizens, can we accept this? I can also fully endorse the comments made by Mr Pöttering.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the decade-long aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a state of their own and also in the rightful aspiration of the people of Israel to live in safety. This is because the latter is so intimately connected with the former, because there can be no safety without peace and there can be no peace without a democratic Palestinian state that is respectful of international law, as outlined by Mr Abbas to the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The acceptance of the timeline drawn up by the Quartet is a victory for the European Union and one which we must salute you for, Baroness Ashton, even though some countries did try to steal the European Union’s limelight. However, the news of new settlements warns us that the path ahead will be strewn with difficulties. That is why it is important to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government and clearly express the EU’s support – despite the absence of absolute unanimity – for a possible vote in the UN General Assembly on awarding the status of non-Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">This House must be united in upholding and increasing this pressure, including putting aside differences of opinion on full membership, giving its unanimous backing through its resolution on the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to be represented as a state at the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think we all agree that the Middle East is undergoing a palpable transformation; the Arab Spring, democracy movements, decline of the autocrats, they all testify to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the bid for the full recognition of Palestinian statehood has become a reality – whether the United States accepts this or not. In this context, too, it is irrelevant that the United States has already signalled that it will veto the Palestinian application, because the idea of a Palestinian state has garnered substantial support around the world. Probably a majority of the Members of the United Nations are in favour, so this acceptance of Palestinian statehood is almost certainly irreversible as a political fact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legally, of course, nothing much has happened, but political realities and legal status are often at variance. What is perplexing in this context, too, is Israel’s solid rejection of the Palestinian position despite all the evidence – and we heard a lot of it this afternoon – that the much discussed two-state solution is the most likely outcome – true, a long-term outcome – of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the implication is that Israel will eventually be constrained to accept the Palestinian bid for statehood, so the sooner it does so, the better for all concerned. It is regrettable, all the more regrettable then, that Israel and its supporters are basically disregarding a new political fact, the due arrival of Palestinian statehood.</p>

      <p sl="en">One, we must draw conclusions from what the EU did before the Arab Spring. We supported civil society, democratic institution building, etc., but it is obvious that many saw EU aid mainly as support for the existing, far from democratic regimes. So my question is: what will the Commission suggest in order to design the programmes, rules, conditionality criteria, etc., for the future, to avoid that?</p>
      <p sl="en">Two, we must also draw conclusions from the fact that historically, some Member States, particularly the old colonial powers, gave priority to their national interests rather than those of the local citizens or the European Union. How can we achieve better coordination for the future in order for the Union to play a crucial and constructive role?</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the Palestinian Authority has applied for membership of the UN as an independent state. This is, without doubt, an historic moment. We know that, barring unforeseen incidents, this will not be approved by the Security Council. We also know that, if this request is submitted to the General Assembly, Palestine will most probably be granted observer status, similar to that of the Vatican.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that, under the circumstances, this will be a very positive development for at least three reasons. Firstly, because it is a question of principle: at last, tangible steps must be taken to bring about an independent, recognised Palestinian state. Secondly, because this will not affect talks to find a solution: why should a change in the status of Palestine affect or, as has been said, prevent the procedure from resuming? I believe that this is a mistaken assessment. The third positive point is that the extreme Palestinian wing, Hamas, which is opposed to the effort being made by President Abbas at the UN, will suffer a political defeat; it will be weakened and its political clout will wane.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, if the Palestinian Authority is initially given observer status and then full member status, Israel’s security will improve. Israel has an inalienable right to security and the Palestinians have an inalienable right to an independent state. Both these objectives can be achieved from a positive development at the UN.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, last month saw the collapse of the Gaddafi regime, after the capital was captured by rebels. At the moment, the pro-NTC forces control the port of Sirte, which means that Libya will be able to undertake the transition to democracy in next to no time. In Syria, the regime of Bashar al-Assad will also very likely endure the same fate soon. While Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans and, we all hope soon, Syrians are discovering the taste of freedom, the scene in the Middle East is very different. While establishing democracy is on the agenda in North Africa and will succeed if a policy based on compromise is established, we see a completely different picture in the Middle East peace process. Here, there is not only a lack of constructive consensus, but a unilateral vision is seemingly being imposed. I believe that this is the meaning behind the application for admission to the United Nations submitted by President Abbas on Friday. Instead of attempting to establish proper internal autonomy before imposing it on the international stage, President Abbas has chosen what was described even by President Obama as an illusory shortcut. Palestine’s application for admission actually indicates that it has gone beyond the negotiation framework defined by the Oslo Agreements and set out by the road map presented in 2003 by the Quartet. Peace is built through negotiation and not through taking unilateral action. The lesson that should be learnt for the peace process from the Arab Spring is that democracy means seeking consensus and not a unilateral approach.</p>

In all honesty, why are you proud, given that the European Union has not managed, even today, even on the question of Palestine’s request for a seat at the UN, to dare condemn the extension of the settlements.</p>
      <p sl="el">The request put by Mahmoud Abbas to the United Nations brings the European Union face to face with its historic responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to respect the decision by the Palestinians to apply for membership of the UN and to support that effort as a basic step and important opportunity for the resumption of negotiations. The Palestinian people are entitled to peace and security, as is the state of Israel. I believe that we should condemn the illegal settlements, which represent a huge obstacle to a peaceful solution to the Palestine question, and all work together for the recognition of a viable Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its joint capital, as this will guarantee peace for everyone in the region.</p>

What I am particularly pleased about is that we in the European Parliament now seem to have come up with a robust joint text, a text which recognises and states that the Palestinians have a right to their own state, based on the 1967 borders, and that Israel and its citizens are entitled to security. Madam President, we want the UN to come up with an answer to this legitimate application by Mahmoud Abbas during its 66th session – therefore, before the year is out – because we do not want to send the Palestinians home empty-handed and we cannot allow this to happen.</p>

What will Europe and the international community do if Israel continues to build settlements as, indeed, it has announced it will in East Jerusalem? Mr Pöttering has already spoken about this.

On the other hand, I would like to inform a number of my fellow Members in this Chamber that this issue does not only involve a unilateral request or a unilateral recognition of Palestine, because the recognition of such a request, i.e. the recognition of Palestine within the 1967 borders, means, at the same time, the de facto recognition of the sovereignty and legitimacy of the state of Israel.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to emphasise one more point. We have heard several times about certain measures being prepared against Palestine.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, as many fellow Members have already said here, the Palestinians’ symbolic bid for independence will, unfortunately, not solve any of the contentious issues which, for years, have strained relations between the parties in the region. Before genuine peace and an opportunity for coexistence are established, the parties must be able to agree among themselves not just on secure borders, but also on such matters as the settlements, water and the holy places of various religions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The region’s imbalance and changes in the near future are very crucial issues. Israel must look on from the sidelines while nations rise up and revolt, hoping for the best from the circumstances, but also fearing the worst. The greatest danger in the region is that the Arab national governments will fall into the hands of extremists. That is also a danger in the Palestinian territories, because Fatah and Hamas have signed a declaration of intent to form a joint government, and it is very possible that, after the regional elections in autumn, the state of the Palestinian Territories will slip into the hands of the terrorist organisation, Hamas.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For that reason, in this situation, the EU’s sole message must be that peace talks need to continue between the parties. The EU cannot support any unilateral declaration, because then it would also be in contravention of the Oslo Accords that it actually promoted and the provision on refraining from a unilateral declaration contained therein.</p>

The treaties must be in place by the end of 2012 – there, like Mr Pöttering, I am in complete agreement with state policy in Germany, no ifs or buts. This is something that needs to be said.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we debated the peace process here over six months ago. I stressed at that time that there was an urgent need to re-start talks because time was not in favour of either of the two parties. I can understand how the stalling of the process has prompted the Palestinians to take the initiative and to raise the issue of their admission to the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are now in a very complex situation. I suppose that this matter will eventually be passed from the Security Council to the General Assembly. I would like the European Union and its Member States to play an active role and for the Twenty-Seven to be united in stating an opinion on the resolution that will eventually be put to the vote.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are no simple solutions: no simple yes and no simple no. The General Assembly’s resolution must be careful. It must not imperil the peace process or put either of the two sides, or the other players who are the main promoters of the process, into impossible situations. However, a failure to act must not be an option.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, today, unfortunately, just like six months ago, I cannot be optimistic about the progress of the talks. The news we have received today about new settlements in Jerusalem is, frankly, very bad. In addition, I fear that some of the 2012 elections will not help lead to a solution.

Recognising the dignity of both Israel and Palestine is not, however, tantamount to putting up uncritically with their mistakes and specious actions.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mr Pöttering, among others, said just now: it is not enough to appeal to sentiment. Settlements should not be built and therefore we need to intervene with appropriate sanctions; because if there are rules, then they must absolutely be protected and respected.

My view on this subject is based on principle. Resuming the negotiations is the best course of action to achieving the solution allowing both states to coexist in peace and security. I think that unilateral steps are not inclined to help the process of establishing a lasting peace, which is the fundamental aim of the whole international community. I firmly believe that the only way to fulfil the Palestinians’ ideals is through direct negotiations. I will support any initiative which might serve this purpose, as I have also done up to now. A viable, long-term solution cannot be achieved if Palestinians and Israelis fail to reach an agreement.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I too, as a contribution to today’s debate, should like to point out that our action and stand are indeed the correct ones, that it is certainly high time to recognise a Palestinian state and that the political line, with a proper proposal from our side, will be supported at the level of the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, I should like to emphasise that I truly appreciate the action being taken by Baroness Ashton at this time and to point out that at least she managed to express a unified line on the part of the European Union on such an important issue. It is a fact that continuing efforts on her part could bring about a unified foreign policy on the part of the European Union as a whole, especially on matters which are directly topical and concern huge efforts by nations for their national survival.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Europe must adopt a joint position, in line with international law, at this definitive point in the conflict between Palestine and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we want to see an end to the violence and human rights violations, all the Member States must support Palestine’s desire to be represented as a state in the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must also denounce the illegality of the Israeli settlements right now, and call for the wall of shame built by Israel to be removed. Both of these are in breach of international law and are an obstacle to peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must similarly demand that the Palestinians recognise the state of Israel and halt the attacks, both armed incursions and others, that are sometimes launched from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just think how we would feel if we had to pass through a check point each day, or live separated from our families by a wall that turns 200 metres into 50 kilometres, work into a chimera, makes development impossible and uncertain, and the abuse of power a daily currency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the policy of the party that I represent towards the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is one of neutrality. We do not believe that the United Kingdom should be involved in any dispute on one side or the other. However, I would hope that this would not be a neutrality of indifference, because I, too, would like to see an enduring peace between these two peoples. But neutrality demands an even-handed approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN, in 1947, envisaged in General Assembly Resolution 181 two separate states, one Jewish and one Palestinian. If one state deserves recognition, so does the other. If a negotiated peace is not a precondition for the recognition of Israel, nor should such a negotiated peace be a precondition for the recognition of Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that it would be easier for the government of a recognised Palestinian state to restrain and control the activities of its citizens than for the head of an ill-defined entity to restrain and control its inhabitants. Furthermore, it will be easier for a recognised state to negotiate peace with authority.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate you, Lady Ashton, for everything you have done. The conflict between Israel and Palestine can only be resolved through direct, responsible negotiations between both parties with the support of the international community. This is why I think that any unilateral action ought to have been avoided as this affects mutual trust and jeopardises the continuation of the peace process. The way to get out of the deadlock triggered by the Palestinian Authority’s unilateral action at the UN must be to resume direct negotiations immediately between both parties under the supervision of the Quartet. I believe that the time has come for the Palestinian Authority to prove its commitment to conducting direct negotiations and, likewise, Israel must be ready to make real compromises as part of these negotiations. Having two independent states based on the 1967 borders is the only viable solution for peace.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the establishment of a new state needs to have a historical basis and be established on international agreements. As we well know, there has never been a Palestinian state in that region: instead, three times during the 20th century, the international community handed over this region to Israel, first under the Balfour Declaration and then via the League of Nations and the UN.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to ask Baroness Ashton whether the European Union is a community of values. Do we actually believe in democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law? If we do, as I want to believe, has Hamas, which, at present, is represented in the Palestinian Government, accepted the Quartet, which includes the EU, and the preconditions for ending terrorism, the recognition of Israel, previous agreements and their adoption?</p>
      <p sl="fi">In addition, I would like to ask whether the European Union is prepared to be aligned with the view expressed by Abbas that some sort of Jew-free Palestine should be created. Are not statements such as these truly anti-Semitic? In this respect, Europe should stand by its values and state clearly that we support democracy and human rights. Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I just say to Honourable Members that we have seen the debate laid out before us. If you add up all the different views expressed in this House, you will find that they reflect, and are reflected in, many of the conversations that I have had, not just in the European Union, but with many other countries as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us start where we agree. We agree that there should be a Palestinian state. Everybody supports that, including Israel. I agree with all of you who have said that it is important to see a Palestinian state come into being as soon as possible. The question is how to support the Palestinian state into being in a way that will bring long-term peace and security to its people and to the people of Israel, who will be its neighbours next door.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would argue that we are discussing the question of how – not if, not whether, not any other question, but how – to make sure that is achieved. It has been the view of the European Union, the view of this House and the view of Member States for a long time that the most effective way to ensure long-term stability and security for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine is through an agreement between the two on borders, on security, on the rights of refugees, on the issue of Jerusalem, on all of the issues that are very familiar to everybody here.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what I am determined upon. I am determined upon reality. I am determined upon making sure that the desire of the people, the desire of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, is achieved and is achieved in a way that they can be sure is going to bring that peace and security to them and to the region. That is what drives me and what motivates me to work with the Member States, to work with you, to work with my colleagues in the Commission, and to work internationally with the Quartet and – way beyond the Quartet – with many countries with whom I have discussed this issue, not just in New York last week, but over the past two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to be clear about one thing, namely about settlements. I have condemned it every time a settlement announcement has been made – six times this year from me, plus one local one and one Quartet one. I have checked the numbers. The announcement that was made today is an announcement of the continuation of a series of legal moves following on from an announcement that was made in 2009. I said earlier on that I deeply regretted that, having condemned that original announcement, we have now seen a move further forward. We have made that position clear, not just in this House, but also to the Israeli Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I also say that, instead of shouting about it – which is very easy to do, perhaps without listening for the response that you get – I say this to Prime Minister Netanyahu directly. Each time I have met him – and I have met him many times – I have made it clear that we consider settlements to be illegal under international law, and that he should stop announcing them and, more importantly, stop building them. I do not accept, I am afraid, what is said to me that somehow, by not using a particular word, I have moved away from my commitment, because I am the one who, on your behalf, is saying it to the person who has the power to make the difference. I will continue to do so in every conversation, not just because it is wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that it is wrong to get people to live in a place from which, when you look at a negotiated settlement, they are probably going to have to move. That does not make any sense, to me, for the people who are moving into that area. It is not a good move if you believe – as I do – that we have to reach a conclusion and a settlement for this conflict that is going to be based upon – as we have said consistently – the 1967 borders, with agreements on moving bits of land around, but which give the Palestinians a viable contiguous state. That is going to mean that there will have to be changes. It is therefore in the interests of all the people of Israel and Palestine to get there and make sure that where people move and where people live is somewhere they can live for the rest of their lives if they choose to.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to make it clear that I have said to Israel that I do believe in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. They have people with whom they can be proud to negotiate. I believe that President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, who I have had the privilege to get to know over the last two years, are people who hold the values that we hold dear in their heart. I believe that they want to see a democratic Palestine, based on the rule of law and the values of human rights. I believe that Israel could do no better than to negotiate with them. I have also said that directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu, to Foreign Minister Lieberman and to other members inside and outside the Israeli Government and in the Knesset. I will continue to keep saying that, because I believe it to be true.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have said many times that I think that the work that Prime Minister Fayyad has done has been remarkable in that, according not to me but to the World Bank and other institutions, he has completed the building of the institutions that will create the state of Palestine and will enable them to be able to function as a state – an important element if they are going to become a country, in the very near future I hope. I was fortunate enough to go with Prime Minister Fayyad to lay the foundation stone in Jenin, a town that has seen a lot of conflict but where they are rebuilding the architecture of the government buildings and which we, as the European Union, are privileged to be able to fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said in the UN when I met with the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee under the chairmanship of Norway – to whom I pay great tribute – that I felt this was a good investment of our resources, because you can see what our money and our support has actually built and achieved. I think that we should be proud to be investing in the work of Prime Minister Fayyad. As I say, I pay tribute to him.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to make sure that everything that we are doing on this is actually going to help to lead to the results. That is why I have been working with the Israeli Government, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab League, the United States, Canada, Russia, and the UN especially – because I agree with what has been said about the value and importance of the UN in all this. I could not agree more. I think the United Nations are critical to all this, but what matters is what we are actually able to achieve. The point about what we did in the Quartet statement was that we laid out a timeframe and invited the parties to now come together in that timeframe. There are issues that they will have to resolve, which is why we suggested they pre-meet. There are issues that the Quartet envoys will need to discuss, which is why they will pre-meet with the parties, but the objective is to get this thing moving.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand the frustration in this House. I have only been doing this for up to two years. I can tell you that I have spent more time on this than on anything else I have done. I have to tell you that, today, I am actually as worried, if not more so, about what is happening in the north of Kosovo, as you would expect me to be. It is really important that whatever we do finds a conclusion that is really going to last. I am not going to do something that is just rhetoric. I am much more interested in a solution that is going to be for real.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, when they come to negotiate, they will have to tackle all these issues in the conclusions. Of course, incidentally, we believe in the International Criminal Court. That has never been discussed as part of a conclusion of negotiations – nothing of that kind – but we do need to make sure that we actually get that. I will continue to do that, based on the fact that I am also trying to carry 27 Member States along the road with me.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is really important to understand how much the unity of the European Union on this subject is valued in the region, not just in Israel, not just with the Palestinian people and the Israeli people, but with the Arab League and with the countries in the region. They really want to see us stick together and see that happen for real. You will understand that that means that I also have to be alive to the starting points, the history, the culture and the connections that all 27 countries have. I am sensitive to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an achievement for the European Union that we are still together. We are continuing to work to stay there, because what we offer, united in this process, is much more than radical positions on either end of the spectrum, or even the bulk of countries coming together in the middle. It is the fact that we are 27 speaking with one voice and one message that makes a big difference, but it is not easy. We have to work at this and keep working at it. That is why your support today is so important, because it enables me to take that away.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have said enough on this. Let me just say one or two things about other countries because, rightly so, honourable Members raised one or two other issues. Mr Fox raised the issue of Yemen. I agree on the importance of working hard with the GCC. I mentioned that we coordinated our statements on Yemen very carefully. There is calm at the moment, but I am worried about some outbreaks of violence that have gone on in the last few days. We urge President Saleh to continue with the process and to make sure that the work that is being carried out by his Vice-President can come forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Libya, as you know, we have had teams going to Tripoli. We have a team there at the present time that is setting up the long-term operation. On the specific issue of borders, we are launching a dialogue on migration, mobility and security with Tunisia and Morocco. We are ready to do the same with Libya. That specifically brings in this point on migration and mobility – not just on security, although, of course, that is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Women are full of hope in the region. We have to make sure that we do not let them down. One of the key elements of the discussions in New York was women coming together to try to make sure that we are able to offer the support of the capacity building programmes already in place in Libya. Looking after women who are victims in all of this violence – and there are many of them – and also ensuring the participation of women right the way through the system is a huge issue that is of incredible importance to me.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding the issues of rules and conditionality, Stefan Füle has set out very well many times in this House the point about ‘more for more’. This is the idea that we make sure that reform is met with greater support, but also this mutual accountability of ensuring that we have respect for each other in what we do, that we do what we say we are going to do on both sides, and that we deliver what we say we are going to deliver to help support these communities into the future. Then, of course, there is the coordination which is so important, between not just the different European institutions, but also the Member States. In Libya, that is going to be really important if we are going to be able to offer the support that we want to.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for indulging me on time. Honourable Members, thank you very much for an important debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Ever since the Arab Spring began, one question imposed itself: would those revolutionary developments speed up or delay resolution of the Middle East conflict, which is one that has the potential to ignite an international conflagration? Well, now, many months after, although things are no clearer, one can detect a slight tilt of the balance towards the latter. In that respect, I am particularly concerned at the possibility that the new revolutionary authorities in those countries, faced with the impossibility of fulfilling the high expectations of their populations, might try to deflect popular energy towards Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">This might be true even for the Palestinian authorities, which probably saw in the recent request for UN state recognition a way to escape possible contestation from ordinary Palestinians, emboldened by the example of their other Arab brothers. It looks as if, recently, both Hamas and Fatah have been losing ground. Irrespective of whether these suppositions are true or not, the potential implications of a worsening of the Middle East conflict would only underline the crucial importance of EU involvement and support in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very pleased to be able to address honourable Members in advance of the Eastern partnership summit, which is to be held in Warsaw at the end of this week. Mr President, this House has been a consistent supporter of the Eastern partnership and you, Mr President, will speak at this event on behalf of the Parliament. I welcome your personal commitment, your presence at the summit, and I pay tribute to my colleague, Štefan Füle, for the immense work that he has put into the Eastern partnership in every possible way to support its development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strengthening of our relationship with our neighbours is a key priority and I said at the beginning of my time in office that I considered this to be the first priority for the European Union and the one on which we should be judged. Our Eastern neighbours have changed dramatically in the last twenty years, but it remains vital for us to help them sustain the process of transition, towards democracy and a market economy. This process, of course, is not only in their interest, but we would argue in our interests, as it enhances our own security and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was in May 2009 that we launched the Eastern partnership as a framework in which to build up political association and economic integration with six countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. We have made some progress in the last two years and strengthened those bilateral relationships with those partners. This year, we want to finalise negotiations for an association agreement with Ukraine, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area. We also aim to launch negotiations on deep and comprehensive free trade areas with Moldova and Georgia once they meet the requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we have made progress on mobility, implementing visa action plans with Ukraine and Moldova, and visa facilitation and readmission agreements came into force with Georgia a few months ago. We want to launch negotiations on a similar basis with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Warsaw, we will be meeting in the context of those relationships. Our partnership extends way beyond governments to links between peoples. I strongly support this Parliament’s efforts to enhance its links with Eastern counterparts, to the creation of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. Civil society and business forums have been set up within the partnership and both will meet in the margins of the Warsaw Summit. Štefan Füle will participate in those.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, over the last four years, more than 2 000 students and academics from Eastern partnership countries have been funded to study in the EU. We believe that this partnership is built on mutual accountability and responsibility and a shared commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights, freedoms and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Poland, we will leave our partners in no doubt that the EU’s acknowledgment of their European aspirations and their European choice goes hand in hand with our expectations for their commitment to progressing towards deep and sustainable democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, our partners are at different stages and our role is to give practical support to that process of political association and economic integration within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Early this month, I conveyed a strong message to Ukraine, stressing that respect for democratic principles and the rule of law, including the right to fair and independent legal processes, must remain the basis of our future relations. Štefan Füle and I are particularly concerned about the cases against Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of her government and plans to revert to earlier electoral systems against international advice. As I have already indicated, Štefan has been working closely with Ukraine over these past months to deliver these messages and to develop the relationship in order that they are able to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been unequivocal in the face of clear repression of democratic and human rights in Belarus in last December’s presidential elections and since that time. We have imposed sanctions against the regime and called for the immediate release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners. At the same time, we have increased our assistance to Belarusian civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the review of the neighbourhood policy that Štefan and I undertook, a key element is that the EU applies more conditionality in its actions, linking them more closely to the efforts made by our partners towards reform. That means more financial support, closer political cooperation, deeper economic integration for those partners who embark on deep reforms. It is what is called ‘more for more’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important ingredient of this new Neighbourhood Policy is that some support will now be redirected towards non-governmental organisations as we build partnerships with civil society. We have the tools to make this happen through the new Neighbourhood Civil Society Facility and we are working on the establishment of a new European Endowment for Democracy to support change in the neighbourhood. I thank honourable Members who participated in giving us advice on both of these.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, Mr President, the conflicts in the region in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Transnistria, in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are perhaps the most concerning obstacles to progress. We expect our European partners to do the most they can to make progress towards peaceful settlement, just as we are making specific dedicated efforts to deal with the many challenges these conflicts pose.</p>
      <p sl="en">In August, on my recommendation, the Council approved the appointment of Philippe Lefort as the EU Special Representative to the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia. His mandate includes contributing to the peaceful settlement of conflicts in accordance with the principles of international law, working closely with all involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course Nagorno-Karabakh remains high on our agenda. In support to the Minsk Group, we are in a dialogue with all the parties to help find a shared solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have the will and capacity to take action in support of conflict stabilisation and settlement. We established the EU Monitoring Mission after the war in Georgia and we are co-chairing the Geneva international talks. In Transnistria, we have played a part in ensuring a decision on the resumption of the official negotiations in the ‘5 + 2’ format was taken on 22 September and we are looking forward to a negotiating process in which all parties will act in good faith and the spirit of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are all committed to making this summit in Warsaw a success, to give renewed momentum to building the closest relationship with our Eastern partners and neighbours, and to give strong messages on the need for them to act appropriately to develop deep democracy and to make sure that we have the rule of law in action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I wonder why Baroness Ashton is speaking from the Council bench. After all, the Eastern partnership is part of Community policy. Perhaps we should discuss this at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a few comments I should like to make. I hope that the Warsaw Summit will be a substantive success and will also improve the climate of relations. I hope that, despite the different developments in the various countries – in particular Belarus, of course – it will prove possible to combine increased efforts in a multilateral approach and that the Member States of the Eastern partnership will come to recognise their mutual interests, making it easier to resolve the ‘frozen conflicts’ you referred to earlier – Nagorno-Karabakh, for example – because a commonality of interests has been established.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the Eastern partnership needs a much stronger structure in terms of this multilateral approach for economic and political reasons if progress is to be made on the economic front as well as in the political context. It is important for us to concentrate on increasing our cooperation with civil society and with the opposition parties in countries like Belarus and, until the European Endowment for Democracy is finally put in place, that we should use the already established European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to ensure the implementation of the appropriate supports for democracy and human rights independently of the state apparatus.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle, please allow me to comment on today’s events. I have heard that the Ukrainian Attorney-General today called for a seven-year gaol sentence for Yulia Tymoshenko and a fine of USD 1.5 billion on the basis of an article of the Ukrainian Penal Code introduced in 1957 by Joseph Stalin and strengthened once again by a number of changes in 1962. It has also come to our attention that this situation applies not just to Ms Tymoshenko, but also to 15 or 16 representatives of the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be very interested to know how we are to respond and what we are to do if there is no explanation forthcoming in regard to this question by Friday, contrary to the impression gathered by Mr Füle, Mr Bildt and myself in our meeting with President Yanukovych. I believe that we need to make progress here. An association agreement, or a free trade zone as Ukraine sees it, is also in our interests. We want to seal the deal. However, it must be made clear that another country that seeks a European perspective must also observe a minimum number of rules in relation to democracy and the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment to the Eastern partnership and for her praise for Mr Füle. He has genuinely earned these kind words because he is working extremely hard, not just on behalf of the Eastern partnership as such, but also in support of the necessary democratic change in the various countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me start by saying that the Eastern partnership is not an alliance against Russia. It is an alliance that supports the countries of the Eastern partnership and their right of self-determination and how they wish to cooperate with Europe in the context of the European Union, with Russia, and with other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is particularly true of Ukraine. Ukraine is an important partner for us and we are aware that this has a lot to do with the situation in Ukraine, which is why we wish the Polish Presidency every success at this summit conference. The people of Ukraine rightly wonder how this agreement with Russia in relation to gas prices was ever reached. How has Russia suddenly switched from an enemy of Tymoshenko to a Tymoshenko supporter and why has Russia suddenly started defending Tymoshenko? What I do know is that the price negotiated was not a very good price for the people of Ukraine, but rather, on the contrary, can be seen as a negative factor. However, my group is very clear on its position: such questions should be dealt with in the political arena rather than in the criminal courts. That is why we would urge Ukraine, the Ukrainian Government and the President to find a way out of the current situation. A judgment against Tymoshenko on this basis – I believe that Stalin was already dead at the time mentioned by Mr Brok, so that cannot be completely right …</p>
      <a text="(Heckling from Mr Brok)"/>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned a date of 1957, but it does not really matter as Stalin was certainly dead by this time. Whatever the legal position may be, it is not acceptable for political objectives to be pursued using the courts. For this reason, I hope that, together, Baroness Ashton, the Commission and Parliament can make it clear that we want the closest possible relations between Ukraine and the European Union. Yet we also want a democratic Ukraine that pursues political objectives by political means. I hope that Ukraine understands this and that the responsible parties in Ukraine also choose this path.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, it takes two to tango, as the saying goes, and after a somewhat tentative opening dance with our partners in North Africa and the Middle East, we need to recognise that we share a dance floor with our partners in the Eastern partnership as well, and that the party is really starting to swing in one or two places.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The atmosphere on the eastern edges of Europe, however, is generally one of awkward and icy reserve. Apart from Poland and Sweden, amongst the Member States, there is little genuine political will or interest in improving relations between the EU and our eastern partners. That is short-sighted, because we actually stand to benefit from stable neighbourly relationships, if only because of our dependence on energy from that region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The summit’s draft statement confirms this picture. I would therefore ask Madam Ashton, Commissioner Füle and all Member States to show more initiative in genuinely deepening the political dialogue. The EU should not behave like a dance teacher to these countries, but like a flexible and sympathetic partner. I am deeply concerned by the show trial in Ukraine and the continuing arrests of activists in Belarus and Azerbaijan. It is, therefore, important right now that we hold out our hand to our partners and step onto the dance floor in the East, ready to attempt some ambitious and creative moves. We need deeper economic cooperation and fewer barriers to travel for us and our partners there. Obviously, there will be conditions attached to this, but continually postponing the dance will not do anyone any good. I wish to thank Madam Ashton for her willingness to intensify the dialogue with progressive social movements, such as the Public Chamber in Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Relations in the Eastern partnership are also changing. After Russia, Turkey is the next dancer to take to the floor. New dance partners may feel uneasy in each other’s presence, but what we need is clear vision and commitment. A fortnight ago, we had the chance to attend our first ball with our partners from the five Euronest partnership countries. It was felt that it was a little too early to send an invitation to Belarus. Although we did not produce a statement that everyone could endorse, I do believe in this process and am confident that, if we continue to practise our dance steps and, in particular, listen to each other, it could lead to something beautiful.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whilst the eyes of the EU are understandably focused on the Southern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Middle East and North African countries, we must not lose sight of the importance of the Eastern partnership and our support for closer relations with the six countries to the East.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ukraine is going through a very difficult phase with deterioration, clearly, now in its democratic structures and the rule of law, as we have seen over the selective justice applied to Yulia Tymoshenko. This is happening just as it wants to sign a deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. Belarus is still in the grip of a dictator, Lukashenko. The situation in the Caucasus is worrying, with continued Russian occupation of Georgia and the escalation of tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK).</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the new European Union Special Representative appointment for the ‘frozen conflicts’ from the High Representative, but at the inaugural meeting of Euronest, which I attended two weeks ago, the impasse over EU membership prospects under Article 49 for the six countries, including the three Caucasus republics, and also the NK dispute, basically paralysed the day’s proceedings, which does not augur well for Euronest parliamentary cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the Warsaw Summit does not get bogged down in the same way on 29 September. The EU should primarily focus on a pragmatic basis on issues like trade liberalisation and visa facilitation as the way forward, not the intractable issues like NK.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the newly established principle of ‘more for more’ should be brought to bear on the Eastern partnership, in particular, when it comes to the development of civil society. The Civil Society Forum is doing an enormous amount of work in this area. At present, it is one of the very few areas in which we have contact with the Belarusian opposition and cooperate with it. Hence, my urgent call on you, Baroness Ashton, and to you, Commissioner Füle: press for the establishment of a secretariat in Brussels for this forum, so that its work can be supported. At present, everything is done on a voluntary basis and the people involved are overwhelmed with the organisational tasks involved. This has a negative impact on substantive content, the area where we wish to see progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of this issue and the extent to which regional conflicts obstruct mutual trust and cooperation have been brought home to me by the controversies in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. It is for this reason that conflict resolution should play a central role in our Eastern Neighbourhood Policy, particularly in the case of Transnistria, where the EU has observer-only status in the 5+2 talks and does not have the necessary acceptance or mediating powers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very hopeful that we can press for the release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners in Belarus at the Warsaw Summit and that we can make it clear that all other questions are dependent on this point. In future, the aim should also be for Russia to be more involved in the resolution of these problems.</p>

Even though I am not sure that the architects of the Eastern partnership plan have a clear set of motives, I would like to believe that the planned summit will strengthen European unity, and will not lead to the creation of a new cordon sanitaire around Russia. I would like it if, before setting out for Warsaw, the EU negotiators could include in their luggage a determination to unify Europe from Ireland to the Urals, and an aspiration to help address problems such as the slow growth of some partner state economies, as well as a determination to resolve disputes such as the one in Nagorno-Karabakh. I would very much appreciate it if the EU negotiators could learn to listen to their partners and abandon the urge to keep giving them advice.</p>

      <p sl="lt">During this summit, it is important for particular attention to be paid to nuclear security, among other issues. Above all, the question of the security of the construction of new nuclear power plants on the European Union’s borders should be examined. Russian and Belarusian plans to build new nuclear power plants near the European Union’s eastern borders may significantly weaken the nuclear and environmental security not just of eastern countries, but the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is little doubt that Russia is quite opposed to our objective of supporting the six former Soviet Republics in achieving political and economic reform. We are aware of this. In the final analysis, the countries that are members of the Eastern partnership are also possible candidates for accession to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">While the planned free trade agreement with Ukraine will finally depend on whether Ms Tymoshenko receives a fair trial under the rule of law, negotiations with Belarus have been placed on hold. We are aware of that too. An EU perspective in itself is not enough to engender democracy, human rights and internal peace, as we see in the example of Turkey and once again in the case of President Lukashenko, Europe’s last dictator.</p>
      <p sl="de">He seems to release imprisoned opponents of his regime every time he needs Europe. The latest announced release of political prisoners has a lot to do with the immense need for financial support, which even a loan of several billion from China has been unable to satisfy. Lukashenko continues to reject democratic reforms, however, despite the fact that these are a condition of financial aid from the West. This is a major criterion for us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the summit meeting in Warsaw must give strong support for, and reaffirm the priority of, the Eastern partnership, which is an important means of influencing the development of those societies. All of these countries are balanced between two different options: either authoritarian structures, or the path towards democracy and open societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is going on just now. The opportunities we lose today will be extremely difficult to regain in the future. I think that it is important to state that this is about Europe, and it is about democracy and the rule of law. Ukraine is an example of that, with what is happening with Yulia Tymoshenko. They are undermining the rule of law and strong support for human rights and an open society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should use all its tools. We are the biggest economy of the world, with the opportunities provided by association agreements, scholarships, and visa liberalisation. At the same time, the strong message is that the preconditions must be fulfilled if you want closer cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the focus of the summit meeting must be to take the concrete actions which make both of these tracks credible and worthwhile.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Eastern partnership has proved its worth. It is a policy which has been in operation for several years now. Today, we can say that after the review, and after all the Commission’s work – thank you, Mr Füle, for your excellent report on the subject – we are on the right track. It is true that the Eastern partnership is a policy which must be diversified. It is a policy which includes Belarus and Moldova, and the European Union is using two completely different approaches to what is happening in these two countries. This explains the principles of ‘more for more’ and ‘less for less’ – this is how we are going to shape this policy. We want to build a strong democracy based on interpersonal relations; we want everything which concerns future relations with the European Union to have strong foundations in society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the eve of the summit, which is an occasion for celebration, there are three things I wish to mention. Warsaw has earned the right to host the summit because Warsaw and Stockholm were the two capitals which promoted the Eastern partnership, so this is a cause for celebration for us and for all Poles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, Ukraine and everything that is taking place in connection with the association agreement is a truly great historical process. Knowing about the terrible things that are going on in Ukraine with its justice system and bearing this in mind, let us not confuse historical matters with the short-term situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, visas will be a great encouragement for the people of these countries, something which will show that it is worth trying for and working towards a closer relationship with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, membership. We should give a clear signal that this is possible. For many countries, membership provides the motivation for change in their country and it should always be stressed that the Treaty of Rome is binding for European countries.</p>

On the eve of the summit, I would like it to be said in this Chamber that the territorial integrity of Georgia is a matter of honour for the West – this is certainly my opinion. Of course, a very large part of our debate today is on the situation in Ukraine and I would like to say that however far I may be from being a supporter and admirer of President Yanukovych, I feel it is completely inappropriate to compare today’s situation in Ukraine with the Stalinist period, as this comparison is simply dishonest, especially from those who are silent on human rights in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to say that if our colleagues in the Chamber are showing a very justified interest in the issue of human rights in Ukraine – I repeat, very justified – I would expect my colleagues and their political groups and chairs to show the same amount of care for human rights in the Russian Federation, in which, I would like to remind them, yet more parties are being banned and others are not being allowed to take part in the upcoming elections to the Duma, while almost half of the Ukrainian Parliament consists of members of the opposition.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eastern partnership is an important political dimension for the European Union, but the obstacles to its future development are currently rather concerning.</p>
      <p sl="it">Dialogue with Belarus remains difficult, while in Ukraine, the Tymoshenko case confirms a relapse on respect for human rights as well as rampant corruption. Parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan are under military occupation and the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing, with a risk of ensuing armed conflict.</p>
      <p sl="it">Without losing hope on the future of the Eastern partnership, we must remind these six partner countries of their responsibilities: respect for the fundamental rules of democracy and the resolution of territorial conflicts. Here, I am referring in particular to Nagorno-Karabakh and to Georgia. Europe cannot accept violations of international law guaranteeing territorial integrity as, moreover, this House has already appealed for in its resolution on the South Caucasus, and we cannot repudiate our basic principles on respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, first of all, on the issue of the Eastern partnership, I would like to draw your attention to the Caucasus region. It is extremely important to view this region as a single whole because, at the moment, this region is actually split into two groups of states, basically one group and one other state.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At present, Georgia and Azerbaijan are conspiring with Turkey to isolate the third state in the region, Armenia, economically, in terms of transport links and in any other way. This is totally unacceptable. The European Union must oppose any external interference from a country outside the EU which is basically attempting to wreck everything that the Eastern partnership is aiming to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, with regard to Ukraine and the case involving Ms Tymoshenko, I think that Ms Tymoshenko is, indeed, entitled to a fair trial. This is a basic human right which has slightly been brought into question due to her excessively long period of detention. However, the Ukrainian people are also entitled not to get hurt and to be governed for their benefit. If Ms Tymoshenko has violated the interests of the Ukrainian people, she must be held to account for this.</p>

      <p sl="en">The summit is happening – and let us not hide this – in a very difficult context. We have negative dynamics in the EU due to the crisis and the South, we had an example of the failure of Euronest to agree a message to the summit, and we have negative dynamics in the East because of the retreat of democracy.

      <p sl="en">I have a question about Ukraine that must be asked. Commissioner, Madam High Representative, do you exclude the possibility that Yanukovych is playing a double game by declaring himself for the European cause and, at the same time, sabotaging it in terms of the abuse of democracy standards displayed in the Tymoshenko case? He is blackmailing us by saying that if not, he will turn to Russia and he is blackmailing Russia by saying that he will turn to the European Union. But Ukraine is the test.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we should not expect too much from this summit but, at the same time, we have to admit that a lot has been achieved since 2009, when the Eastern partnership summit launched the new initiative. Two years is not very long, but, at the same time, we were able to shape a policy which is now starting to produce results. I cannot be so pessimistic about the dynamics because I can see with my own eyes that more and more people from the eastern countries, from the eastern partners, see their future in a family with us. They want to work in the same way that we work, with more transparency, with more responsibility, and this is something that we should encourage.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that with the ENP review in May this year, the Commission’s communication gave the policy a new impetus towards the east as well. Here, we should say that we can only achieve results if we coordinate more and if we support each other’s initiatives at different levels – Commission, Council, Parliament and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to pay equal attention to the East and South. This is a message we got from all our partners. We need as a common goal visa-free travel, and this is important for the people as well. We also need to open more programmes for the partners, especially those in education and science. Finally, an association agreement with Ukraine is something that could be a good example for all the others, and I must say that the fact that the penal code dates from Stalinist times only shows how much reforms are needed, and also that Ms Tymoshenko failed to change this code when she had this opportunity.</p>

The partnership summit’s final report should contain practical proposals including the future introduction of visa-free travel for the countries involved. The European Commission has not made nearly enough funds available to achieve this, in view of the importance of the area. We should seriously think about recapitalising the eastern border regions of the European Union, including the Lublin region, which could, to a greater extent, take on the practical aspects of facilitating contacts within the framework of the project.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have noted an asymmetry in the neighbourhood policies of the European Union towards the South and the East. The political turbulence in Belarus and Ukraine should not be allowed to hamper the whole project. The Eastern partnership should become a platform for cooperation to prevent, among other things, a repetition of the ‘Arab Spring’ scenario in the form of a serious conflict immediately outside the eastern borders of the EU. Destroying the idea of the Eastern partnership due to a lack of funds may give the impression that we do not have a vision for the European Union’s future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Warsaw Summit will acknowledge the European aspirations of our East European partners. That is true, but is it enough or is it a ritual phrase unfit for the political realities developing along our eastern borders? At a time when Tymoshenko is subjected to a Stalinist trial, at a time when Putin and Medvedev swap places like interchangeable tsars, our message should reaffirm the democratic alternative, as a counterweight to the Putinist contagion that threatens the whole area. And yet our messages are not exactly convincing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Membership prospects are almost taboo. Liberalisation and trade agreements are moving forward, but at a slow pace. The focus on the events in the South has generated frustration in the East. Our partners have reason to believe that they have been downgraded. The Nabucco project is less visible than it used to be. The mediation capacity of the Union cannot properly deal with so-called frozen conflicts. As a result, the frozen conflicts are ready to ignite.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum it up, all is quiet on the eastern front. This deficit of political will does not encourage our partners to pursue democratic reforms.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, it is understandable that recently, we have paid more attention to the southern borders of the Community than to its eastern borders. However, we should not forget our partners to the east of the European Union. After the enlargement in 2004 and 2007, we have new neighbours. I believe that mutual cooperation can benefit not only the six participating countries but also the European Union. The opportunity provided by the Warsaw meeting should not remain unused. A number of observers consider the year 2011 to be a key one for the partnership and its future.</p>
      <p sl="sk">One of the priorities is, of course, the financial aspect. Although the annual financial volume is to be increased by three quarters in the period from 2008 to 2013, a key role will be played by the discussions on financial support for the period from 2014 to 2020. This is a key challenge not only for the Polish Presidency, but for all of us. From the diplomatic and political perspective, it will also be important to address at the summit Russia’s role in the policy of the European Union vis-à-vis the six former countries of the Soviet Union. Although Russia is not involved in these initiatives, such a partnership cannot be interpreted in any way whatsoever as anti-Russian activity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Finally, I would like to emphasise that an initiative of this type must not miss an opportune moment in 2011 under the Polish Presidency.

If our partners from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are so justifiably concerned today about human rights in Ukraine, for example, to the point that they have added four years to Stalin’s lifespan, I am sure they will also agree that the clear prospect of membership for countries of the Eastern partnership is the best thing we can do for these countries and their human rights. This means that we are appealing to the Commissioner and, of course, to the Polish Presidency, for the Warsaw Summit to be a celebration, not because it is taking place, as Mr Siwiec would have it, but because it will provide these countries with a clear prospect of membership. As a result, we will be of help to them both in their geopolitical situation and concerning respect for human rights in their countries. So I appeal to Ms Ashton to ensure that a clear signal is given at the Warsaw Summit concerning integration of these countries with the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Eastern partnership is important both for us and for our Eastern European partners. The level of rapprochement with the EU depends on how our neighbours develop in terms of the rule of law and democracy. The EU has thus chosen the right approach by demanding ‘more for more’. However, the corollary of this is ‘less for less’.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is particularly evident in our relations with Ukraine. I hope that Mr Yanukovych understood the words clearly expressed by all three bodies in Yalta last week, formulated by Carl Bildt, Elmar Brok and Štefan Füle.</p>
      <p sl="de">To date, the Stalinist paragraphs from the Criminal Code, on which the political cases against Lutsenko, Tymoshenko and others are based, have still not been abolished. Yanukovych must be measured in terms of the rule of law and democracy. Anyone seeking to associate himself with the EU should not provide grounds for the united opposition to come together in a committee to prevent the re-establishment of a dictatorship. The opposition parties are doing this because they hope their country can have a shared European future. I agree with Mr Kamiński’s criticism of the situation in Russia in relation to human rights. He mentioned the elections. We should not send a team of election observers because, sadly, it is already evident that the elections to be held there will not be democratic. Naturally, the criticism we express against Ukraine must be expressed equally vociferously against a large country like Russia.</p>

This is because not all the parties who wish to contest the election are to be allowed to stand and the media and the entire state apparatus lacks a structure that allows us to assume that Russia will have elections to the Duma that deserve the name ‘democratic’, in even the most fundamental terms. For this reason, we should save ourselves the expense. I would point out that we did not travel to Russia for the last elections either.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Eastern partnership has been our response to the interruption of gas supply from Russia and to the conflict in Georgia. We wanted to reassure the Eastern countries that they were not forgotten and their hope to get closer to the EU is a tangible expectation. The fact that all these countries belong to the former Soviet space has inevitably brought Russia into the equation, complicating it from the very beginning. Moreover, since then, the current problems in the EU created by the crisis, and the unexpected developments in North Africa, have complicated matters even further, while not deterring Russia from taking advantage of these difficulties. I would only hope that when the negotiations on the association agreements are completed, there will not be any last-minute political change of heart, on our part, in honouring them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Eastern partnership summit is undoubtedly the most important foreign relations event of the Polish Presidency. A clear final declaration from the summit may become a lasting element in the dynamics of developing and intensifying cooperation between Brussels and its Eastern neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind the crisis which is raging in Europe and the stronger engagement in relations with the south, the decrease in interest in the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy raises serious concerns, because – and this is worth stressing – the next enlargement will, in fact, take place in this region. This is why we should already be building solid foundations, and this is why I am hoping for speedier progress in negotiations on the association agreement with Ukraine. There is still a possibility that this agreement will be signed before the end of the year. Equally, free trade with partnership countries is also an excellent way to improve economic conditions in the whole of the EU. Acknowledging the membership ambitions of Georgia and Moldova will be a significant step forward, and introducing visa-free travel, especially in view of the fast-approaching Polish-Ukrainian European Football Championship, will bring significant benefits to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In our relations with our Eastern neighbours, we must not forget constantly to promote the idea of freedom. In Belarus, political persecution is a daily fact of life. The long-running conflict in the Caucasus does not help in building stable and positive relations. European countries must present a clear position in these matters.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is true that the countries in our Eastern Neighbourhood are currently at a crossroads where there is a choice between development towards fully functioning democracies or stagnation. Civil society, non-governmental organisations and freedom of the media are extremely important, but we cannot start on anything else until we have ensured that there is peace and stability.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Several fellow Members have previously mentioned Nagorno-Karabakh and, fortunately, the tension that we all felt during the spring has not erupted and developed into something worse. It also showed that when we work together – that is to say, we in this House along with Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle – we can control the situation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the fact that it is calmer at the moment does not mean that we can rest on our laurels. Instead, I would like to send out two messages from this Parliament: firstly, that Baroness Ashton should explain to us more often and more regularly what is being done in these frozen conflicts in particular and, secondly, that we must treat all frozen conflicts in the area in the same way.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This does not only apply to Nagorno-Karabakh. It also applies to South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria. The EU must take the same approach to all frozen conflicts and treat them all in the same way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Eastern partnership offers many opportunities for fruitful cooperation between the EU and its eastern neighbours, but its greatest added value lies in its multilateral dimension. Therefore, it is very important to keep the balance in the relations with all the eastern partners, not to focus on separate countries but rather to develop the potential of this neighbouring region as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regional cooperation is crucial in this regard, particularly the development of the transport and energy corridors, which is not only indispensable for EU security but also an important element of the partners’ economic integration with the EU. Unfortunately, this cooperation is impossible in a situation of conflict and closed borders. Therefore, we need to create an atmosphere of peace and trust and to step up our efforts to find a peaceful solution to the still unresolved conflicts in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is playing a stabilising role in Georgia but should be much more active as far as the conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh are concerned. It should put more focus on these issues in the framework of the EU-Russia dialogue, which is very important. Clear EU commitments are also needed for post-conflict participation and stabilisation. I think this is the way forward for the increasing role of the EU as far as the Eastern partnership is concerned.</p>

I have the impression that from the very beginning, Europe has been half-hearted towards the Eastern partnership, whether on matters regarding membership or relating to funding. However, I do appreciate both your commitment, Ms Ashton, and yours, Mr Füle, in ensuring that the Warsaw Summit is a success. I would like to ask you both, and especially you, Ms Ashton, not to look at the partnership from the point of view of the situation today, but from the point of view of the future, from the point of view of young people and education. This is a great opportunity, and we in Central Europe know what is meant by the opportunity to improve our civilisation. I would like to call for a comprehensive education programme, a new initiative from the Eastern partnership aimed at those who, when they reach adulthood, when they grow up and have completed their education, will be part of a shared Europe together with us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why I am daring to propose something new – an Eastern partnership university. We need your new initiatives on membership, on funding, but also on future generations.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is very optimistic of Ms Ashton to say that the Eastern partnership summit will be a success. However, I do wish you, Ms Ashton, Mr Füle and especially the Polish Presidency, this success. I hope that, in anticipation of the summit, we will not succumb to the same mood that was prevalent in Parliament after the last Euronest session which failed to adopt any conclusions. Nevertheless, it is also worth saying that it is a great success that this Parliamentary assembly has managed to meet and has begun its work.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What am I expecting from the Eastern partnership summit in Warsaw? Firstly, a unanimous decision to finalise the association agreement with Ukraine. I believe that the Ukrainian Government and President will do everything possible to release members of the opposition, in particular, Prime Minister Tymoshenko. Secondly, the summit should encourage work on association agreements with Moldova and Georgia to begin. I would also like it to support change in Belarus. Thirdly, the summit should encourage the countries of the partnership to cooperate within the context of the Eastern partnership, and this is one of its most important tasks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What sort of incentives might encourage future cooperation within the partnership? Amongst other things, relaxation of the visa regime. There are no visa requirements for Russia, but the European Union has the Schengen barrier. There is no incentive for the people in the countries of the Eastern partnership. So this is where we must make the most effort. Ukraine, and Moldova in the future, are definitely both on this path. I would also like to see support for civil society, support for border infrastructure, and support for any project which brings our citizens closer to each other.</p>

      <p sl="el">The neighbourhood policy certainly needs review and, of course, the Commission communication entitled ‘A new response to a changing neighbourhood’ is also important and is a move in the right direction. However, there are sectors in which the steps needed have not been taken. The neighbourhood policy has proceeded in a fragmented manner and we are not always to blame. Of course, the commitment to human rights must remain very strong on our part and, at the same time, support must be given, subject to conditions and depending on the progress made in each individual country. The approach to civil society is, of course, also of vital importance and is a positive development.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, the proposal to create a European Fund for Democracy is clearly welcome. However, this will take time to set up and, at the same time, there are funds and instruments that have not been utilised as they should, which have only been partially utilised, and I think that, until such time as the European Fund has been set up, this is what the Commissioner should focus on together, of course, with the Council’s political decision of decisive importance which, I am sure, will come out of the Warsaw Summit.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Warsaw Summit is undoubtedly one of the key events of the Polish Presidency and I believe that it will also become a significant milestone in the relationship of the European Union with its eastern partners. In a situation where the European Union has the ambition of playing an important role in global politics, it should define clearly its stance towards its nearest strategic partners. It needs to send a clear signal that it is determined to play a key role in this region. To ensure the success of the eastern partnership, it is necessary to create a real political partnership through a strengthening of relations, taking clear decisions, and promoting values and objectives leading to reforms and a strengthening of cooperation with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The summit offers an opportunity to set up an agenda for these relations and to determine their intensity for the next period, which may be crucial. Otherwise, these countries, which are to be our partners, may begin to view their relations with the European Union from an instrumental perspective and may get stuck halfway between democratic reforms and the Soviet past. This is not in our interest. Therefore, we have to respond decisively to problems such as visa liberalisation, the strengthening of democratic institutions and civic society and, last but not least, issues such as trade, economic cooperation and security. Thus, the European Union should get closer to these countries and should offer them, at the same time, an opportunity to get closer to the European Union. I hope that the Warsaw Summit will be successful in this respect.</p>

I believe that the eastern partnership should become a useful instrument for mutual benefit based on common interests and the respect of each other’s obligations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Warsaw Summit should primarily bring more clarity into the negotiations concerning the association agreement and free trade with Ukraine.

A number of sensitive issues are still open. We are well aware that the Nagorno-Karabakh issue has been left unresolved for a long time from the European side too, and I believe that the tension there is rising. On the one hand, there are certain claims on the side of Azerbaijan; on the other hand, there is Armenia of course, which is supported by Russia. We must find a prudent political solution.</p>

On the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union, it is my firm conviction that the EU, divided to the extreme, can be reunited with its region on the other side of the Iron Curtain only through this kind of solidarity, and thus complete its integration process.</p>

Despite the fact that the closest neighbours of the Poles – the Belarussians and the Ukrainians – have political representations which we can legitimately criticise for their democratic deficits in the administration of their countries, we have to keep in mind in particular the citizens of these countries, who should receive a clear signal from Warsaw that Europe respects them and is interested in friendly coexistence with them, irrespective of the political leadership ruling their countries.

Even Stalinism hardly went this far, as back then, efforts were made to at least keep up appearances. How will Baroness Ashton respond if the Ukrainians, Belarus or others enquire about this?

      <p sl="en">Madam President, congratulations on your election.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members have raised a range of different issues and I begin with the one that our colleague Mr Brok raised, which is: why am I sitting here and not there? I move between the two places each time; if you build me a bench in the middle I would be very happy to sit there. I am trying to fulfil my obligations!</p>
      <p sl="en">The most important question that I think has been raised in our discussion has been: do we have the political will to put the amount of energy and effort into our partnership in the east in the way that we have spent a lot of our energy looking to our southern neighbourhood? From the commitment of honourable Members and, I hope from what I have said in this debate and the number of times Štefan has discussed these issues from his perspective and from our joint perspective, I believe the answer is very clearly ‘yes’. The summit that we have this week in Warsaw is really important and I want to thank the Polish Presidency very much for the enormous amount of work that they have put in. I can bear witness to that work and I thank them very much for all the effort that they have made.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is because of the work that they have done and because of the commitment that I think you will see from Štefan and myself that we see a strong representation from the European Union and, I hope, a successful summit in the making. However, I do not underestimate all the challenges as we look at our six partners in our eastern neighbourhood. Our relationship with each one of them brings with it some challenges that need to be addressed and concerns, all of which have been expressed in this House this evening, in terms of frozen conflict, the potential for new conflict, the need to espouse the value and principles that we must hold within the European Union. However, we expect those we wish to collaborate with also to take these on, so it is important to make sure that how those concerns are dealt with is clear and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brings me to the case that has been raised most often in our discussions, which is that of Yulia Tymoshenko. I want to be clear that the issue that we have raised is this apparently selective use of criminal judicial measures, and to say that the criticisms come not only from us but from many others, from independent experts. I think it is very important they be taken very seriously. This is the issue that I have raised with them, the issue that Štefan has raised with them. When we see judicial process, we wish to see due process. We wish to see people dealt with fairly and properly, within the way in which we operate as a European Union. Having once been a justice minister, I know how important this is as part of that journey in the development of the European Union and how important it is that we stand absolutely by those principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are going to continue with our discussions on the deep and comprehensive free trade area and the association agreement because we believe that an association agreement provides stronger guarantees on some of the issues with Ukraine that we think are so important. As Members have pointed out, it goes without saying that any agreement has to be ratified, that national parliaments and the European Parliament will want to make sure that they are comfortable with the spirit in which this is done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically, too, Members raised the issue of the civil society facility. We have already identified EUR 22 million for this facility. Its purpose is to focus on the empowerment of civil society and increase public accountability, which is a really important issue. Coming back to my point about transparency and openness, the value of the Endowment for Democracy proposal is to enable us to do things that we cannot already do. It is not to duplicate what the instruments that we have do, but to look at some of the questions that have been raised in our discussions with our partners across the east and the south. How do we support the processes more effectively? How do we support young people? How do we support the growth of the political process? That will enable us, we hope, to work in a slightly more arms-length way, which can be of great value to those who wish to get support and help but do not meet the criteria that we quite rightly have for our instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to end by focusing again on what I think the deliverables will be at this summit. First of all, the clear timeframe for the signing of the Ukraine Association Agreement and the free trade agreement, and for the start of those negotiations with Moldova and Georgia. If we are able to move forward on these, that would be important. Mobility is a big issue for many countries, and the importance of looking at what we can deliver on mobility over the coming months will also be a big part of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the question of some cooperation between different sectors, particularly energy and transport, and, of course, political cooperation and dialogue. If we are able to use this opportunity to bring together the leadership with the European Union and with our eastern partners, and develop a stronger relationship, being clear about the commitments that we expect as well as the commitments that we give, with ‘more for more’ and mutual accountability being the watchwords of how we operate, I think it will have been an enormous success and it will give new energy to our work with our eastern partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I began, may I thank the Polish Presidency especially, and the Hungarian Presidency for the groundwork that they put in. I look forward very much to what I am sure will be a successful Presidency event in Warsaw.</p>

Today, the promotion of democracy throughout the neighbourhood of the EU is one of the priorities of the Polish Presidency. The aim of the summit is to stabilise and increase the prosperity of our Eastern neighbours, and although the Eastern partnership does not promise membership of the EU, it does foresee progressive and far-reaching integration with EU policies and the EU economy and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Eastern partnership intends to strengthen cooperation by improving bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the regions, by creating a free trade zone, introducing visa liberalisation in the long term and extending the Erasmus programme. The European Commission is preparing to implement, before the end of this year, an institutional development programme for Eastern partnership countries, with a total budget of EUR 173 million. The Commission is also holding discussions with partner countries on regional development pilot programmes, for which over EUR 150 million has been earmarked for 2010-2013.</p>

Although the events of recent months rightly drew our attention to North Africa, we must keep in mind that just like the masses that ignited the spark of the Arab Spring, citizens of the countries in the European Union’s eastern neighbourhood are driven by democratic motivations. We have a great responsibility in this situation: Are we able to offer an alternative that can make these countries remain faithful to the European Union and the values it represents in the long term? I support the efforts of the Polish EU Presidency to give an impetus to the European Union’s Eastern Neighbourhood Policy and to conclude the relevant agreements and begin negotiations about tightening economic and commercial relations – from free trade agreements to visa liberalisation – as soon as possible, once the partner countries are ready. In the future, the European Union should assume a greater role in the management of deadlocked conflicts that are poisoning relations between our eastern neighbours. I am pleased that according to the plans, the Eastern partnership summit to be held in the second half of the week will see all EU Member States represented at the highest level except for three large countries.

      <p sl="ro">A positive development has been noted in Chişinău where, during the extended meeting of the working group dealing with coordinating the visa liberalisation process with the EU, the latest progress in the implementation of the Action Plan on visa liberalisation was presented, along with the first Progress Report published recently by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The EU should remove the phrase ‘long-term objective’ from all the relevant documents concerning visa liberalisation, including the draft association agreements with Moldova and with other Eastern partnership countries. By promoting citizens’ mobility and contacts with the EU, we are also supporting the development of the countries neighbouring Europe, such as the Republic of Moldova. Visa liberalisation promotes good understanding, links with civil society and intercultural exchanges. This would be the first sign that the Eastern partnership is sincere and serious in its intentions.</p>

      <p sl="en">This summit should mark the EU´s will and commitment to its eastern neighbourhood. The EU has to demonstrate that its eastern neighbourhood is of the highest strategic and political importance. It is crucial that we show our Eastern neighbours the same dedication as we do to our Southern neighbours. An increased budget is a must to ensure sufficient tailored assistance. I especially would like to underline the importance of the new association agreement with Ukraine which is about to be signed in December this year. Ukraine has demonstrated its willingness and readiness to be part of Europe and, despite backlashes, has pursued its policies towards deeper European integration. We need to fully acknowledge this fact and make sure these developments will continue by signing the association agreement as soon as possible. I call also upon our Eastern neighbours to step up their efforts towards respect of human rights, democracy, and freedom of speech, media freedom and rule of law. The EU is based on these values and it is crucial that our Eastern neighbours fully implement and respect these values in order to pursue further European integration.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Eastern partnership summit marks an important occasion for strengthening and highlighting the European Union’s relations with the countries in the east. I welcome the approach presented by the Commission and High Representative Catherine Ashton in Communication COM(2011)303 for treating each country in the EU’s neighbourhood policy according to their merits (‘more for more’ principle) and on the basis of clear criteria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Republic of Moldova is a model for the Eastern partnership. During the last two years, the Alliance for European Integration has initiated major reforms in constant consultation with the EU. I welcome the European Parliament’s explicit reference to the prospect of the Republic of Moldova’s accession to the EU, in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty (the recent resolution on the association agreement). The prospect of accession is important to the reformers in this country, providing them with motivation and encouraging their efforts to continue with implementing the necessary reforms.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament has also called for negotiations to be initiated with the Republic of Moldova on a Free Trade Agreement by the end of 2011, and for greater efforts to be made to resolve the conflict in the Transnistrian region, while respecting the Republic of Moldova’s territorial integrity. I welcome the announcement made recently by Prime Minister Vlad Filat on resuming the official 5+2 negotiations. I consider relevant his idea of replacing the troops in the Transnistrian region with a civilian mission. It is important for the EU to play a greater role in these negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Warsaw Summit provides an important occasion for examining the progress that has been made among the European Union’s eastern neighbours, using this as a basis for devising specific policies for a common future. The European Union must support the transition to democracy in the countries of the Eastern partnership. This is why I think that a key step in doing this is to present a clear prospect of the partner countries joining the EU, as well as to implement the structural reforms required to bring them into line with European policies and regulations. I would like to stress the need for the EU to assume specific commitments regarding the signing of association and free trade agreements, as well as the importance of visa liberalisation for Eastern European partners.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We should not overlook either the role played by local and regional authorities in harmonising relations within the Eastern partnership. Their contribution is vital and must be focused, in particular, on territorial development, supporting mutual contacts and improving economic relations. Furthermore, Eastern partnership countries need to take important steps towards increasing respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The EU’s objective in its eastern neighbourhood must be to focus on creating a democratic, stable region to ensure respect for freedom, dignity and fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">I look forward to an ambitious Eastern partnership summit in Warsaw. A far-reaching Joint Declaration should outline concrete goals to be achieved for the next two years until the EaP summit in 2013. The main pillar of the EaP should remain the European perspective for partners who are willing and able to perform according to the values enshrined in Article 49 of the European Treaty. Next steps should be: fast-forward towards increased mobility for EaP countries – mutual commitments to start up remaining visa dialogues (Georgia) and negotiations on VFRA (Armenia, Azerbaijan and with Belarus); start of DCFTA negotiations with Moldova and Georgia. Conclusion of the negotiations with Ukraine by the end of 2011 would make a much needed success story. Building lively and strong EU and EaP relations is needed for both sides; its success lies in the coordinated actions of all EU institutions and all EU Member States. If we want to create an area of stability, shared values and progress surrounding Europe, it is important to consider carefully and strike the right balance between both ENP vectors.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to underline three main ideas. First of all, I consider that the perspective of membership should be the silver thread that guides our relations with the Eastern neighbours. Not only do these countries belong geographically to our continent, but they are deeply interlinked with the EU through both history and culture. Enlargement has been the most successful foreign policy tool of the EU and can serve as a strong incentive for internal reforms aiming to reach deep democracy in these countries. Nevertheless, we all understand that membership of the EU will not be accomplished tomorrow. Not only because of the enlargement fatigue, but also because these internal reforms take time and sometimes steps forward can be followed by steps backwards, as the case of Ukraine proves so clearly. This is why we should pursue firmly the objective of visa liberalisation in order to provide people-to-people contacts. A democratic evolution of these countries through emulation of already set standards can only come along in this way. Finally, we should apply the principle of ‘more for more’, encouraging countries such as Georgia or Moldova, that have made significant progress lately and whose willingness for reform must be wholeheartedly welcomed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Eastern partnership cannot be a substitute for candidate status among our neighbours who are seeking EU membership. We cannot ignore the efforts made by Georgia, Moldova and, in particular, Ukraine in building relations with the European Union that are tighter than a free trade association. The Eastern Neighbourhood Policy must, however, be based on mutual trust with Russia. Without this, Russia may resort to drastic steps. Although not a participant in the Eastern partnership cooperation, Russia is an unavoidable actor in the EU’s Eastern Neighbourhood Policy. This is clearly demonstrated in the case of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government was recently faced with a choice between preserving its good economic relations and favourable gas supply treaties with Russia or entering into a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. In this delicate situation, it is of great significance that it is Poland, a Member State intimately familiar with relations with Russia and within the eastern partnership, that is holding the EU Presidency. I hope that the Polish Presidency will be able to handle the matter with impartiality and neutrality. However, it would have been even better if the Eastern partnership summit had been held on its original date in February, while the Hungarian Presidency was still holding office. It is unfortunate that, at that time, the summit had to be postponed due to scheduling problems and a poor willingness to participate. As it is, Hungary has lost an opportunity of prestige value, and the European Union has lost valuable time.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Eastern partnership policy will deliver its first major success: the association agreement with Ukraine. It is undoubtedly great news. But, when looking at the way this success was achieved, it also raises some concerns for the future. The Yanukovych government had to withstand enormous pressure from Russia which was meant to deter Kiev from a European path. This time around, we may have successfully snatched Ukraine from Russia’s embrace. But European integration cannot be this three-way strategic game. It is not a model of integration that is viable in the long run: because the closer our Eastern partners come to the EU, the more confrontational the process will get. So, looking ahead, our challenge is to create a more benign geopolitical environment context for our Eastern partners to move closer without being subject to such pressure and dilemmas. This, of course, means a more open and honest dialogue with Russia. But it also implies coordinating and interlinking – strategically, as well as practically – our neighbourhood policy and our Russia policy. This, I believe, is one of the lessons we should learn from the Ukraine negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, today I reaffirm my own commitment and the commitment of the European Union to the entitlement of all people, wherever and whoever they are, to enjoy the full range of human rights and to do so without discrimination or the fear of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Around the world, the issues of gender identity and sexual orientation continue to be used as a pretext for serious human rights violations: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are still subject to persecution, discrimination and ill-treatment, and that ill-treatment often involves extreme forms of violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are 80 countries which still criminalise same-sex relations between consenting adults, and seven which apply the death penalty. Let us be clear: this is incompatible with international human rights law. It is a cause for which I was proud to fight in my native country, and it is a cause which I take up now on behalf of the 27 Member States of the European Union. We continue to protest against these abuses and to offer practical support on how to end discrimination and to encourage inclusiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the channel of the United Nations, the European Union takes this message to the world: 15 of our Member States were part of the group which prepared the statements on ending acts of violence and other human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which was agreed by 85 countries at the UN Human Rights Council in March this year. We also welcomed the resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity tabled by South Africa and adopted at the Council three months ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Elsewhere in the UN system, the EU has supported LGBT rights in the NGO Committee of the UN Economic and Social Council, and, in December 2008, we were instrumental in delivering a UN General Assembly statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity which had the support of nearly 70 countries on five continents. That statement reaffirmed the principle of non-discrimination and condemned all executions and arrests made on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It calls on all states to decriminalise homosexuality, especially including capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is an organisation of values, and it brings those values into the heart of its relationship with its partners beyond its borders. With its African, Caribbean and Pacific partners, for instance, we proposed the amendment of Article 8 in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. We wanted to adapt that non-discrimination clause to the language of the Lisbon Treaty by introducing a reference to sexual orientation. The ACP side could not accept the proposal, and a compromise was agreed which uses the language of the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights. This says that the dialogue shall focus on discrimination of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. We knew that a matter of principle had to be raised, and we will keep raising it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to set out briefly some of the practical examples of how we work. Over the last year, we have raised the same principles in Uganda and Malawi: in Uganda, against a proposed parliamentary bill further criminalising homosexuality and raising serious human rights issues, and in Malawi against the long prison sentences imposed on a gay couple. We spoke out and made public statements together with Members of this House and NGOs, and we worked behind the scenes with our delegations to argue the case for justice and human rights with these two governments. In this we succeeded.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also uses our regular human rights dialogues with individual countries to promote tolerance and non-discrimination for LGBT people. In countries like Moldova, those dialogues have resulted in expert-level follow-up, and in countries like Russia, Croatia, Turkey, Montenegro and Brazil, the Union has used its instrument for democracy and human rights to support local and international NGOs in their campaigns against discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our action has ranged from physical protection, which we offered to LGBT people who had received death threats in the wake of the assassination of David Kato in Uganda, to the practical promotion which saw 4 000 people attend a gay pride march in La Paz, Bolivia.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can always do more to promote awareness throughout our delegations worldwide and guide them in their work. In June, we adopted a guide called ‘a toolkit to promote the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender people’. I much appreciated the support of this House and joint working in order to produce this toolkit. It sets out ways to bring about decriminalisation, promote equality before the law and in society, and support and protect those who campaign for LGBT human rights. It also gives guidance on taking this issue onto the international stage in the UN.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we stand by the principles of human rights and we articulate that view. So, too, do we give practical support to establishing those principles. We cannot allow discrimination over sexuality and gender anymore than we can allow it over colour and creed. Human rights are as indivisible as they are universal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sadly, the adoption of the resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity did not receive much coverage in the press, yet the adoption of this resolution marks an historic moment. I am glad that the European Parliament now has an opportunity to comment on this question. Indeed, it is important that the European Union should vigorously defend its values in international bodies and in its relations with third countries, but it is also important for us to be vigilant in defending the values of the European Union within our borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore calling on the Member States and on the High Representative to ensure that the Union is consistent in its internal and external actions in the field of human rights, as set out in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. In fact, I have observed that homosexuals are still the victims of extreme prejudice and the subject of discrimination in certain Member States of the Union. We also need to take action in response to the criminalisation of homosexuality around the world. We have already condemned this within Parliament on numerous occasions, but we must continue our efforts by engaging in regular, respectful and frank dialogue on questions pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me close by saying that we have a financial instrument for combating discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity in the form of the European instrument for democracy and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I thank the High Representative Catherine Ashton for her statement. Cathy, may I also thank you for your personal commitment to this issue of non-discrimination. It is always a pleasure to follow Michèle Striffler who equally has been outspoken in the defence of people who have been discriminated against because of their difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">You rightly, Vice-President, mentioned David Kato, a man who, because he sought to end discrimination in Uganda against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, was ultimately murdered; the three Iranian men who, only days ago, were hanged by their neck until they were dead because they were gay; Jamie Rodemeyer in the United States of America who committed suicide because he was bullied to death. They are the real examples of what discrimination does. Those who speak out using either their belief or their religion or their politics on behalf of such discrimination support those who would murder and those who would discriminate and by so doing, they demean themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948, yet that was what we had to settle for in the Cotonou Agreement. It was shameful that our Cotonou partners would not accept our definition, a wider definition, and it is a wonderful example that 63 years after the Universal Declaration in 1948, people still feel that we can find others to discriminate against in order to reinforce our position in society.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we in the Socialist and Democratic Group welcome the resolution at the UN. It is a historic time; it is a turning point in the history of human rights. Sexual orientation and gender identity are at last increasingly understood to deserve equal protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU does not have a perfect track record on human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. The Parliament is aware of this and has made it clear in the resolution which lists outstanding issues within the EU. This is vital because, if we are to be taken seriously in the defence and the promotion of human rights, we must hold the same mirror up to ourselves and examine our own record.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work and the commitment of the High Representative and the External Action Service and Member States’ diplomats are outstanding. They have worked in partnership with countries from around the world, and I emphasise ‘in partnerships’. This is not cultural imperialism because human rights know no boundaries and no borders. They are universal and indivisible. Therefore, the Parliament is equally respectful of the ongoing progress at the UN and does not seek to dictate to it or influence its process. But, with this resolution, this House wishes to encourage positive developments for universal and indivisible human rights, both at home and in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased with the lead that both South Africa and Brazil have given in their sponsoring and their promotion of the resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It is ground-breaking work, we need to do more to support them, but equally can I please give a plea on behalf of trans people. We need to depathologise their right to health, we need to end the fact that being trans is to be seen to be suffering from an illness or a sickness. To be yourself is no illness and no sickness. It is to demand that your unique place in the world is respected. That is why we must do all we can to support this resolution, and I so move.</p>

We touched on the urgent need for the EU to be a partner in ensuring that reforms on human rights are inclusive, deep and meaningful. The exact same goes for LGBT rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">My party, the Dutch liberal D66 party, was the initiator of same-sex marriage, which we established ten years ago. Unfortunately, the challenges, both within the EU and in the rest of the world, are often much more elementary. In our Union, and unfortunately also in this House, there are too many who discriminate, exclude and even attack sons, daughters, fathers and mothers, neighbours and colleagues simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and it is much worse elsewhere. Iran and Uganda were highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us work together towards solid and inclusive respect for human rights in the EU so that, along with our (hopefully) more effective and ambitious policies, we are a credible global player. In the EU, North Africa, the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, LGBT rights are human rights. We must use the toolkit that is available.

Holding an open and respectful dialogue on sexual orientation and gender identity amongst UN Member States is indispensable in achieving a world where equality and non-discrimination against LGBT people is the international norm.</p>
      <p sl="en">The safeguarding and promoting of the universality of human rights is a fundamental part of the EU’s common values. Regrettably, on gay rights, these laudable principles are not yet fully upheld by the entire European Union. We still see unfortunately, although rarely, cases of discrimination against gay and transgender people in the European Union. Member States should also reaffirm their commitment to protect LGBT rights in the conduct of their foreign relations, both bilaterally with third countries – in particular, in the Arab world and in parts of Africa where criminal sanctions are still widely applied, including, disgracefully, the death penalty in some cases – and also multilaterally in all international fora, including the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank Vice-President Ashton for her support for LGBT issues. We already knew from other cases that you are very strong on that and support us on that. I also agree with those who have already said that the resolution at the Human Rights Council really was a turning point for LGBT rights worldwide, with countries like Brazil and South Africa and others in southern countries supporting it. This is something that we have not had that many times before, and it was the first time at the Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a fact that this Parliament has been very outspoken on LGBT rights, not only on the very tragic assassination of David Kato just recently, but also on the cases of so many others who are not so prominent in their struggle: human rights defenders who are assassinated, who are beaten up and tortured, who are ousted from their families, from their schools, just because they fall in love with a person of the same sex. Love is like a human right: every one of us is happy when we have it, and when we have it in our lives. As a lesbian woman myself who has been fighting for these issues for almost 30 years and met so many people who have been active in very difficult situations, I am happy that we have this resolution today in order to support and push the External Action Service, the foreign minister of the European Union, Member States in terms of internal matters, and all other EU institutions to press ahead with doing away with violations of human rights against lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask Lady Ashton two specific questions. Do you support what we have in this resolution by six groups (which I very strongly appreciate) a comprehensive road map against homo- and transphobia by the European Union? And do you support the Commission helping to withdraw gender identity from the WHO catalogue of mental disorders? Because that is what is at stake at the WHO.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, homophobia is continuing to prey on our minds here in the European Parliament, and for good reason. Despite the debates here in Strasbourg, homophobia is not really in decline in the European Union. As long as we fail to put our own House in order, we will continue to lack a certain amount of credibility with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The best remedy against homophobia is to ensure full equality of rights. My group has made a number of proposals that would make the resolution even more specific in this respect. The fact remains that, in practice, we still do not have full equality of movement for same-sex couples in the EU. Obviously, they are allowed to seek and get jobs in other Member States, but that does not mean that their partnerships or marriages are recognised. That is why they are missing out on all kinds of rights which married couples take for granted. The best action against homophobia is ensuring equal rights and that can only be achieved through mutual recognition of partnerships and marriages.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Outside the European Union, the situation is even more serious, of course. I am thinking of the developments in Africa, where many LGBT people fear for their lives. What support is the European Union giving to the movement founded by David Kato, the murdered Ugandan activist, and to similar movements in other countries? What is the European Union doing to support gay rights movements in neighbouring countries? What initiatives is the European Union taking within the framework of support for the Arab Spring? Do they include an element for combating homophobia in these countries? This is a long list and I hope that, with this resolution, the European Parliament will ensure that these issues are given maximum priority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Turkey is both a candidate country and a NATO member. It is, of course, in our interests to try and seek to calm tension and, from my perspective, to bind Turkey into the delivery of our foreign policy objectives. I spent time talking with Foreign Minister Davutoğlu on a whole range of issues, but it will surprise no one in this House that the issue that he and I spoke about when we met bilaterally at the United Nations was the issue that is before us this evening. I, of course, worked closely with the Foreign Minister of Cyprus, who is new to our deliberations on the Foreign Affairs Council, but follows in the footsteps of her predecessor. We are well aware that the current tensions over the drilling issue concern us because they also involve a candidate country.</p>
      <p sl="en">My services have been working very closely with Štefan Füle, and continue to do so. Because of the nature of this debate, I am now going to hand over to Štefan to continue from this side of the House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as soon as tensions appeared over this issue, we followed developments very closely and with increasing concern. The Vice-President/High Representative and I made it very clear right from the start that threats are not an option when it comes to solving problems between neighbours. Disputes need to be settled by peaceful means. This is a guiding principle in international relations and in the European Union, and Baroness Ashton has made that point a couple of times during this afternoon’s debates.</p>
      <p sl="en">We regret and reject any statement or action that runs counter to this approach. Moreover, as the Council has stressed on several occasions, our Member States have the sovereign right to conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in accordance with the European Union acquis and international law, including the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. Let me recall that, under international law, the European Union and its Member States only recognise the Republic of Cyprus on that island.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has also repeatedly underlined the importance of progress in the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all European Union Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. I firmly believe that Turkey and the European Union have much more to gain through integration and dialogue than through tensions, especially at a time where the stakes in the region following the Arab Spring are so high. Turkey and the European Union need to support jointly the aspirations of the people on the southern flank of the Mediterranean for democracy, human rights, stability and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is based on a number of core principles and values including good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes, resorting, if necessary, to international arbitration. We are, and remain, committed to this approach, which is the best guarantee for peace and stability. We assure you that both the Vice-President/High Representative Catherine Ashton and I made all these points very clearly in our recent contacts with all our interlocutors.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the beginning of July, the United Nations Secretary-General met the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Geneva. They decided to enter into an intensive period of negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement. Since then, we have all been looking forward to a crucial phase of settlement talks in the autumn and the resolution of an issue that would be to the benefit of all Cypriot citizens, the European Union, Turkey and the entire region. This phase is ongoing and I understand the leaders are intensively discussing the substance of several core pending issues. This is a chance not to be missed under any circumstances. I therefore urge all parties now to focus all energy, efforts and minds on the comprehensive settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">During this crucial ongoing phase, it is essential that all parties concerned exercise restraint and do their utmost to ensure a positive climate that will facilitate successful completion of the process. Let us give the settlement talks the best chance to succeed. I trust that all European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, will send the same messages and encouragement towards this end to all the parties concerned.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, the use of threats, including military threats, has always marked Turkey’s foreign policy. Turkey resorts easily to threats when things do not develop in line with its geostrategic ambitions, regardless of whether or not such developments are legal under international law or international practices. This is also confirmed by the escalation in the reaction and threats by Ankara to the exercise of the legal, sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus to explore its exclusive economic zone in accordance with the Law of the Sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">Obviously, the utilisation of serious wealth-producing resources by the Republic of Cyprus will improve energy security in the European Union and support the policy to diversify energy sources. In addition, the prospect of benefits to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots is a strong incentive, rather than a deterrent, to progress with and finding a solution to the Cyprus question and, of course, the Republic of Cyprus should not pay for the illegal occupation of part of its land by suspending the exercise of its rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, Turkey is, I fear, trying to foster controlled tension in the area in order, among other things, to acquire the status of regional force and locum tenens which it has constantly sought in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, the dividing line between controlled and uncontrolled tension is extraordinarily fine. Turkey is literally playing with fire.</p>
      <a text="(The speaker continued in English)"/>
      <p sl="el">Turkey is more a security consumer than a security provider in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="el">Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, the European Union needs to send a clear message of condemnation and rebuttal of the Turkish threats and of solidarity with our partner, the Republic of Cyprus. This is primarily a question of the Union’s credibility and sense of decency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament want to see Turkey taking a strong role, particularly in the region of the Eastern Mediterranean. We wish to have Turkey as a partner. However, a partner must behave like a partner. Unfortunately, what we are witnessing at present is far from partnership. We were very pleased to hear foreign minister, Mr Davutoğlu, say that Turkey was interested in politics that did not involve conflict with its neighbours. However, when I think of Israel and Cyprus, conflicts between Turkey and its neighbours seem to be growing in number. This is unacceptable to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turkey must accept that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and enjoys our full solidarity. When, as is the case at present, Turkey tries to put Cyprus under pressure with its warships, when Turkey makes a foreign policy statement saying ‘We will not talk to Cyprus when it holds the Presidency of the European Union’, then this is unacceptable to us. We are faced with policies that do not just target the Greek population of Cyprus, but also the Turkish population, because they make it increasingly difficult to reach an agreement within Cyprus itself. What we want is for the island, the country and the population to be united. We want both parts of Cyprus to cooperate and insist that negotiations must take place. However, this also requires a willingness on Turkey’s part to act in partnership.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of my group, I would like to state that we stand in complete solidarity with our colleagues in Cyprus and with the Cypriot population. Cyprus is doing the right thing. I would urge Turkey to respect the fact that Cyprus is an independent Member of the European Union and has our full solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as the High Representative and Commissioner Füle are aware, Turkey’s foreign policy is guided by a doctrine called ‘zero problems with neighbours’ but, unfortunately, today, Turkey is experiencing problems with almost all its neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The mounting tensions with Cyprus are of special concern to this House. The Commission has rightfully urged both sides – the Greek Cypriots as well – to show restraint. Turkey’s role in the region is important and could be a great vehicle for more intensive cooperation between Turkey and the EU. I hope the Commission and High Representative will find active support from Turkey in their efforts to find a negotiated solution to the Middle East conflict, and I hope that they will seek closer cooperation with Turkey to end the ongoing hell that we see in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, EU-Turkey relations are, formally, predominantly about domestic affairs and reforms: the Copenhagen criteria. A focus on foreign affairs and Turkey’s important role in the region neither compensates for nor replaces the relevance of making reforms to meet these criteria. Similarly, it seems that Turkey’s economy is doing better than all its neighbours, with truly remarkable figures. Yet economic success cannot replace good governance, respect for civil rights and a functioning rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">A press release I recently received from the Turkish Government aimed to explain that the rule of law is not violated in Turkey, but accepted that there are approximately 70 journalists in prison. Official charges are not always filed and pre-trial detention periods can last years. To make matters worse, indictments that are presented are often supported by something called ‘secret evidence’, which makes a transparent judicial process impossible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Turkish Government asserted that these journalists are in prison on terrorism charges and that those of us who believe press freedom is under pressure are wrong. This House, the Commission and the External Action Service have assessed the press freedom issue in Turkey with great concern. Would the High Representative and the Commissioner agree that it is time to broaden the scope and assess whether counter-terrorism laws are being abused and whether the rule of law is still functioning in line with the Copenhagen criteria, so that we can move towards the much-needed accession of Turkey to the EU?</p>

      <p sl="en">Commissioner Füle, what are we doing to encourage Cyprus to stop the exploration whilst we await the reunification talks? As a Member State, it owes a duty to this Union not to push when we ask for time. It is not a question of sovereignty. We have already clearly established that.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am not sorry that we are having this debate, because at the end of the day, there has not been any discussion of Turkish-Cypriot relations nor of the situation in Cyprus since 2004. So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Republic of Cyprus, acting according to international law and having signed agreements with its neighbouring countries, has initiated an official exploration within its exclusive economic zone for hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turkey has never accepted this legitimate fact. In 2008, Turkish warships repeatedly harassed the vessels conducting oceanographic research in Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. In the light of the drilling process, Turkey, at the highest governmental level, has repeatedly threatened Cyprus, demanding that it abandon its lawful rights. The threats are becoming facts. Warships have been dispatched, and a so-called agreement with the occupied part of Cyprus for exploring the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus concluded.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea was ratified by the European Union and is thus part of the acquis which Turkey, as all European Union candidate countries, is expected to respect and be bound by. Instead, it chooses to ignore it. Turkey is undermining the sovereign rights of an EU Member State and Community law. It is escalating its unilateral action, jeopardising the peace process for the solution of the Cyprus problem and endangering stability in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group strongly believes that any further instability in the region would be to the detriment of the people of the region and of the EU itself. The EU must send Turkey a very clear and strong message that its action is violating international and European law and that it has to stop. This behaviour is unacceptable.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, I greatly fear that Europe is going too far. Here we sit, being told that we need to advise restraint on both sides. Why on both sides? The Republic of Cyprus is carrying out explorations of its economic zone in due form and in accordance with international law and Mr Karim, if I have understood correctly, says that they should stop. How can that be? It is their economic zone, why should they not carry out explorations? Why are we putting the offender and the victim on an equal footing? This is unfair treatment of the Republic of Cyprus. As things stand, to say that both sides should demonstrate self-restraint means that all of us here are ignoring international law and are ignoring sovereign and national rights and the contractual obligations which the European Union has towards Cyprus. I consider this unacceptable and we need to take a bold and fair stand in keeping with international law.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second point I wish to make is this: Bismarck said that the only stable factor in foreign policy is geography. Baroness Ashton, do you have geographical borders on the scope of EU foreign policy? As we have you to represent the single foreign policy of the EU, should we not know where these geographical borders lie? Geographically, do we know where Europe starts and ends? We need to know and to defend it. I will go one step further: when gas reserves are found in Cyprus, who will benefit? The European market will benefit. Should we not therefore defend these European interests and products?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, up till now, the Commission has assessed the tensions and the potential conflict between Turkey and Cyprus as a bilateral conflict. I disagree. The conflict is between an EU Member State and a country that has been accepted as a candidate for the EU club. Therefore, the Commission must not be silent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The planned exploration is in Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. This extends to the south of the island and in no way limits exploitation in the northern part or the rights of Turkey. For me, it is crystal clear that these rights follow from the UNCLOS Treaty, where economic zones are described, followed by bilateral agreements. The fact that Turkey did not sign UNCLOS does not mean that it rejects it. In the 1980s, Turkey declared an exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea and reached an agreement with Romania, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union. It used the same median line method then.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore urge Turkey to refrain from all threats. I also have a question for the government of Cyprus. I would ask it to give an assurance that the move towards the exploration and possible exploitation of natural gas and oil reserves in the exclusive economic zone will not in any way impinge on the possibility of an agreement between the two Cypriot communities on reunification, and that this will be to the benefit of both communities. I think that this should be done – or could be done – for instance, by pledging to earmark reserves, or part of the future revenue, for the benefit of the whole Cypriot community once reunification is achieved, and also by pledging to provide electricity, generated by natural gas, to northern Cyprus.</p>

As Commissioner Füle said, negotiations on reunification have been ongoing – without success, so far – between top-level representatives of the Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots for more than two years now. The negotiations carrying on with the active assistance of UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and his special adviser, Alexander Downer, are entering the final phase at the moment. There is much at stake. Either it will be possible to find a solution that is satisfactory to both of the parties to this long-running dispute, or, influenced by the changes in the Middle East, there will be a definitive and permanent division of Cyprus, with fatal consequences both for Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots. I would therefore like to make an appeal again from this place to the representatives of both communities, President Christofias and Doctor Eroğlu, to focus on a successful conclusion to the negotiations and not to take any steps that would lead to a further escalation of tension. It is in the interests of both communities to reach a permanent and sensible compromise, so that Cypriots can decide jointly on the fate of Cyprus, including its mineral wealth in offshore waters.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, in a period in which, under pressure from the crisis, the Union is seeking and moving towards ever closer fiscal and economic integration, the undersea wealth in economic zones which, under international law, are exploited by individual Member States, is an issue which concerns us all and our economic future and the energy security of the Union. Injustice cannot create rights. The fact that Turkey has occupying forces in the northern part of Cyprus does not imply that it has acquired rights to the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus in what is, moreover, a completely different geographical area, especially when we all know that the Republic of Cyprus has abided by all the provisions of international law to the letter and when we also know that it will take a great deal of time, perhaps several decades, for the benefits from current exploration to trickle down to the citizens of the whole of Cyprus, time which more than suffices to find a solution to the Cyprus problem – which would be useful sooner rather than later – and to share the benefits of this exploration fairly between all the citizens of Cyprus, regardless of their ethnic origin.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are in the 21st century. Turkey is making a mistake if it thinks that gunboat diplomacy can be exercised against a Member State of the European Union. To conclude on the subject of negotiations: negotiations on the Cyprus question have lasted for thirty years. If we take the line that the Republic of Cyprus has reduced sovereign rights during the period of negotiation, then it would be as if we were withdrawing sovereign rights from the Republic of Cyprus. It is wrong for us to say so and wrong for us to argue so; the solution must be found elsewhere and the solution is to apply international law logically and judiciously and for us to seek a solution to the Cyprus problem within that framework.</p>

      <p sl="es">This is not about tensions between two countries, but rather threats by Turkey against Cyprus, which have taken shape in the movement of Turkish naval ships. Threats that Turkey makes against a Member State are threats against the whole of the European Union.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, may I start by endorsing what Mr Swoboda has said in connection with this crisis. I shall make certain points which have not been made by previous speakers. First of all, the crisis does not concern Turkey and Cyprus; it concerns Turkey and the European Union, and the eastern borders of the European Union. We all know that, in a bid to exploit and expand its own exclusive economic zone, Turkey has also contested the right of Greek islands, specifically Kastellorizo and the other islands in that vicinity, to an exclusive economic zone.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thus, in its effort to foment trouble, Turkey has given notice of its own exclusive economic zone, because it has not signed the Law of the Sea, which has been signed by the whole of the European Union, and it is claiming no more and no less than about half the Eastern Mediterranean. As regards the area in which exploration is being carried out, it is off Egypt, at the southern point of the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus. Apart from that, Turkey has linked this specific episode to the talks, to the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus and to the fact that it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus. More importantly, the presence of the Turkish navy in the area is, unfortunately, currently being verified by other states; there are reports of US aircraft flying out of Sicily to monitor for the presence of Turkish submarines. Israel is doing the same while, for our part, unfortunately, the facility for the European Union itself to act is very limited.</p>
      <p sl="el">Baroness Ashton, I will close with this: we still have a long way to go before the European Union has a real common foreign policy and common defence policy. We must all help to resolve this incident.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the musical chairs at the front of the hall, and the lack of any real statement from either of the representatives, is perhaps at least recognition that exclusive economic zones are not a matter of EU competence; they are a matter of international law. Quite apart from the dubious wisdom of drilling for hydrocarbons on a planet whose temperature is increasing far too fast and in countries which have huge resources of renewable energies, this is a challenge the European Union cannot ignore.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are in this situation partly because we failed to insist on a peace deal prior to Cyprus’s entry to the Union and partly because, since entry, little progress has been made on a solution for the island and the Union has gone cold on Turkey’s adhesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note the speech of Cyprus’s new Energy Minister, Praxoula Antoniadou Kyriakou at the Energy Council last week, and I welcome her commitment to the opening of the energy chapter for Turkey, which Cyprus blocked in 2007. But I note, too, that exploratory drilling has begun. Knowing Turkey’s objections and knowing its offer of 24 September for a UN mediator on hydrocarbon resources, aware that drilling will be seen as more than an economic activity, and at a time when UN negotiations are entering a very delicate phase, what Cyprus is doing may be defensible legally but it is bound to be inflammatory politically, and we should not be surprised at Turkey’s reaction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, of course, we must urge Turkey to show restraint, but we must also give some hope to the Turkish Cypriots that they might have a share in the wealth of an estimated 20 billion barrels of oil.</p>

My point is that we should not be surprised at Turkey’s reaction. I agree with the very wise comment made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten earlier in this debate. If we really want to find a solution, then it has to be a solution that gives all Cypriots a chance of sharing in the wealth that will be generated from the drilling.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the key for this debate is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Law of the Sea does not suit Turkey. To the detriment of all Cypriots – Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike – Turkey is trying to serve her own interests and not the interests of the Cypriots, with threats and faits accomplis devoid of any legal basis. It is the same Turkey that ignores the rules of the European Union. Yesterday, it was the extension of the Ankara Protocol; today, it threatens to freeze its relations with the EU during the Cypriot Presidency. Turkey abides by no rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">I subscribe, Commissioner, to your call for a successful outcome of the talks for a settlement, but I urge you to study the statement by Mr Erdoğan in Cyprus that leaves no room for Mr Eroğlu to have a conciliatory stance. The drilling will not affect the talks unless somebody is looking for an excuse. Turkey should not be encouraged, Mr Watson, by your saying that you are not surprised by it behaving like a bully.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, while the governments of the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey are busy with their moves in the eastern Mediterranean, Turkish and Greek Cypriots are sitting and waiting on the sidelines. They have most to lose from this present situation. Our priority should be to ensure negotiations are carried out successfully to realise the unification of Cyprus.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is extremely worrying that the tensions in the region have been raised just before the start of the next round of negotiations. Both the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey are responsible for doing their utmost to establish a positive climate for negotiations to make sure a historic window of opportunity will not close down. The people of Cyprus need all parties involved to work together to reach a comprehensive settlement. The people of Cyprus – Greek and Turkish – who are all European citizens, deserve a stable future in the EU. It is about time that the European Union works for both of them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I condemn the Turkish threats against Cyprus. Ankara is in breach of international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which forms part of the European acquis. It has not signed, it does not respect, and it is not applying this convention. It is creating tension by sending gunboats into the Eastern Mediterranean and it is using the unrecognised state to illegally endeavour to create an exclusive economic zone. Although it is a candidate country, it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the United Nations and of the European Union and which has the sovereign right to explore and exploit its natural resources. Turkey is acting as a terrorist state in the Eastern Mediterranean. I call on the European Parliament, the European Union and, especially, Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle, to stop this policy of sitting on the fence and, more importantly:</p>
      <p sl="el">firstly, not to open any chapters, especially the energy chapter;</p>
      <p sl="el">secondly, to warn Turkey that, if it continues its threats, its accession prospects will immediately be suspended;</p>
      <p sl="el">thirdly, I call on Ms Oomen-Ruijten to include in this year’s evaluation report on Turkey that, if these threats continue, its accession prospects will stop.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr Rouček, do you not think that, when you talk about self-restraint on both sides, you are basically sitting on the fence and putting the offender and the victim on an equal footing? Do you not think that you are blackmailing Cyprus when you say that any breakdown in talks will result in division and permanent partition? Mr Watson, why have you not condemned Turkey for blatantly infringing the Law of the Sea, while Cyprus is respecting and applying it? I want clear answers.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the Arab Spring shifted the geostrategic balances in the Eastern Mediterranean, causing volatility and instability. The European Union has every reason to safeguard stability and to prevent any escalation of tension in this rapidly changing region. Unfortunately, Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union, has opted for a slippery slope, by contesting the sovereign rights of Member States enshrined in international law and defiantly threatening to use military violence, deploying its gunboats in international waters and taking openly hostile action.</p>
      <p sl="el">The traditional balance in the region appears to have been overturned and the path which Mr Erdoğan has chosen, in basically ignoring Europe, is causing a great deal of concern right across the continent of Europe and in the United States. Clearly, anyone who invests in tension for internal consumption and in order to become a regional leader is playing a very dangerous game. Turkey’s words and deeds are putting peace and stability in the area in danger. We call on Turkey to assume its responsibilities honestly at this very critical time.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, it makes me very sad to see that solidarity with Cyprus and our brothers and sisters there is currently being set aside.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is one of our Member States that is being attacked by a foreign power, and the seriousness of this cannot be emphasised enough. At the same time, the security of us all is being threatened by the Turkish aggression that is increasing by the day.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think we should try to keep calm. I have two specific questions. Firstly, what are the Council and Commission planning to do, should the UN withdraw its good offices from the talks on the island? Secondly, what precisely is your reaction going to be to address the problem of the Turkish boycott of the imminent Council Presidency from July?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the Republic of Cyprus is part of the European Union and behaves accordingly. It is circumspect and responsible in the standpoints it adopts and the measures it takes. On the other hand, Turkey has now been occupying for a considerable time a large part of the island of Cyprus and thereby part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this context, it is really ridiculous that the European Union should permit a discussion tabled by Turkey on restricting the right of the Republic of Cyprus to exploration drilling in its territorial waters. I understand that the Turks would also wish to benefit from the wealth located in the coastal waters of Cyprus and thus also of the European Union. However, international law is clearly on the side of the Republic of Cyprus, so, we need to begin to restrain this expansionist appetite in a calm but determined way.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that we will find support for this legitimate public criticism of Turkish military threats with our partners in the United States and in the international community. We only have to try and find it.</p>

    <intervention id="2-733-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, to start with, I can assure you of my understanding for your emotion and your concern, although some of the statements have rather crossed the line. Let me assure you that the last time I checked the news, no one had been attacked.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we can clearly say that we all agree that increased tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean are in nobody’s interest. We can also agree that we stand by one of our Member States when its rights are called into question.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make a remark here, because there was a question of the extent to which the Commission considered this to be a volatile issue. What is volatile is the disagreement on the delimitation of borders: exclusive economic zone. What is not volatile, and never will be, is an approach based on threats, which violates the United Nations Charter.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we all also acknowledge that the most important issues right now are the Cyprus settlement talks. The United Nations and the Secretary-General, but, in particular, the leaders of the two communities, have invested enormous effort in making them succeed, and it is our responsibility and duty to support these efforts in any way we can.</p>
      <p sl="en">A united Cyprus would bring peace, stability and security within the European Union, in our close neighbourhood, and in one of the most troubled regions in the world. It would also have a positive effect on relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am well aware that the European Union and Turkey are in a delicate phase in their relations; the pace of the accession process is disappointing, with no chapter opened since June 2010. The European Union is expecting more and faster reforms in Turkey to address urgent issues under fundamental rights and freedoms. Turkey, too, is frustrated by what it perceives as a lack of commitment from the European Union to negotiations. I believe the fresh tensions around the whole drilling issue partly result from this frustration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make a couple of remarks here in reaction to a very important debate and adding to a number of the statements I made at the beginning and also during the Question Time we had earlier today in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have no problem with assertive foreign policy – if that policy is responsible. I have a huge problem with irresponsible policy. Threatening a Member State, talking about the role of the navy, is irresponsible and needs to be condemned. It is being condemned, and it will be condemned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another point: the issue has never been doubts over the rights of one of us. No one has indicated that there could be a problem. The only point was timing. Most leaders made a personal commitment to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that they will not be distracted by anything and that all their efforts will be focused on finding a comprehensive settlement, in such a way that the settlement is found before Cyprus assumes the Presidency of the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with those who made the point that what is really of the utmost importance is to send, at this point in time, the clear message that, as far as the benefits of this hydrocarbon project are concerned, they belong to all citizens of Cyprus, in both communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish I had an answer to the question of what our contingency plan is if the United Nations decides to withdraw. I do not have one, and I am not aware of anyone having a Plan B. This is one more reason why we all need to support the United Nations and the Secretary-General and special representatives. President Barroso recently sent a special envoy who at this point in time, with the talks being intensified, is fully committed to the talks and is available to the special representative Alexander Downer, on a 24/7 basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also address the issue of the statement that Turkey is going to boycott the Cyprus Presidency of the European Council. I was confronted with this statement when I visited Turkey soon after the elections, a couple of hours after the new government had been formed. My immediate reaction was that, instead of sending this strange ultimatum, all our efforts needed to be focused on finding a comprehensive settlement before that time. This is exactly the angle which, I understand, has been used by the Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, speculating on what is going to happen if no settlement is reached on the Cyprus issue. I shall not continue his speculation on what is going to happen. I think we all need to use the time between now and the beginning of next year – not the end of June – to move the settlement talks forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I disagree, with respect, with those who try to say that we have been talking for thirty years. There have been a number of phases and a number of efforts. We do not have anything better than the current plan, with which we are moving forward and making progress. The Secretary-General of the United Nations made this clear during the last meeting with both leaders. There is commitment on the part of these two leaders; there is a kind of road map that they have both committed to. So expectations are high.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was talking about frustration; that frustration is unfortunate and largely unnecessary. What we need now is constructive engagement; we do not see any other option. Turkey and the European Union need each other more than ever in addressing jointly the challenges of the day. They are already closely linked by trade, investments, 50 years of association and now, accession negotiations. There are real benefits to working closely together with Turkey in our common neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, however, the European Union accession process with Turkey has proved a powerful instrument to force reforms in this country. Turkey today is a more democratic country than it was ten years ago thanks to the European Union accession perspective. Even though reforms should be accelerated and broadened, they nevertheless continue, as demonstrated over the summer by significant steps such as the return of confiscated property to the non-Muslim religious communities or strengthening of civilian control of the military. And yes, I am aware of the increasingly troubling issue of press freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am concerned about the current legislation: particularly the anti-terrorist law, which has an ambiguity which is unfortunately being used to put a huge number of journalists in unnecessary detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">But my approach is that we need to open chapters and engage with Turkey, rather than closing chapters. Let me remind this House that, as far as the accession process is concerned, we have only three chapters to open. Three chapters are available to us to open. Their nature and substance makes them rather difficult, and if you looked at the accession process of some other countries, you would see that those chapters which are available for the EU-Turkey relationship are being addressed only at a late stage of the accession process. The truth is that part of these chapters are being frozen on the basis of the Commission recommendation – some of you mentioned the Ankara additional protocol, the Ankara agreement. But there are others which are being blocked unilaterally by Member States, thus limiting the area of engagement. I do not want to speculate whether, if we open the chapter on energy, we will be facing a similar situation to today’s.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will address a different issue. If we open Chapter 23, on fundamental rights and the judiciary, it will give us an opportunity to keep abreast of the Turkish reforms in the most important area – the rule of law. It is a pity that this chapter is not available for the accession negotiations. Turkey and the European Union need to develop a renewed positive agenda, building on the achievements of the accession process and our joint interest, and give a new momentum to our relations. This supposes renewed efforts in a number of key areas, including support for political reforms in Turkey, alignment with our acquis, addressing important trade issues, closer cooperation on visas and migration and a closer dialogue on foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I believe this is the only way forward, and I look forward to discussing these matters further with you in the coming months starting in October, once the Commission has adopted its enlargement package.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Turkish-Cypriot conflict, which is unresolved due to the international community’s inability to make the parties reach a negotiated settlement, is flaring up again in an extremely charged global environment, especially in the Mediterranean region. Indeed, Turkey shares some of the responsibility for escalating tensions in the region. In the wake of the deterioration in its relations with Israel, the Turkish Government, committed to a policy of aggression in recent years, decided to oppose the Cypriot Government’s intention to explore for gas reserves off the island by launching its own exploration activities in the eastern Mediterranean. This policy of force threatens the negotiations between the Turkish and Greek communities aimed at reuniting Cyprus. There is also the risk of tearing apart a region already affected by political changes and economic problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the European Union has a duty to reject categorically these acts of provocation and show total solidarity with a Member State which is a victim of threats from a third country. We vociferously call on Turkey to refrain from any hostile actions if it wishes to remain a reputable partner. The threat of freezing relations with the EU if Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency next year casts doubt on both the prospect of Turkey joining the EU and the future of bilateral relations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The problem with the partitioning of Cyprus should have been resolved before beginning accession negotiations with Turkey, as was promised on numerous occasions. As it was not resolved, Turkey takes everything as a pretext for reiterating that it does not acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus’s sovereignty and for supporting the north of the island, which is under Turkish military occupation. At present, tensions have been rekindled in relation to oil and gas drilling in the eastern Mediterranean within the island’s exclusive economic zone. The European Union has limited itself to refusing to come out in favour of either side, calling for moderation and respect for international rules. It has not even had the decency to express solidarity with one of its members, nor even to confirm that, in this matter, Cyprus is clearly well within its rights. It refuses to recognise that for months, Turkey has been declaring that it is willing to resist European constraints on internal reform and to return to a foreign policy that is more in line with its own geostrategic interests. They are entitled to do so. However, the action must be noted and Brussels and Ankara must accept the consequences: quite simply, that it is no longer credible to pursue the accession negotiations.</p>
