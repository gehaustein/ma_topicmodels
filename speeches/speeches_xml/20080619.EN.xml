      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0169/2008) by Zita Gurmai, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, entitled Towards Europe-wide Safer, Cleaner and Efficient Mobility: the First Intelligent Car Report (2007/2259(INI)).</p>

    <intervention id="4-007" speaker_id="23805" name="Zita Gurmai" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our everyday lives we depend increasingly on transport. The European economy too relies on having efficient road transport. Increasing traffic, however, has given rise to serious social problems. It causes congestion on roads and in urban areas, results in serious environmental and health problems, wastes energy, and above all causes accidents. Very briefly, here are a few shocking statistics: annual carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic total 835 million tonnes; 40 000 people die on the roads every year; the costs associated with traffic congestion in the European Union amount to EUR 50 billion annually, equivalent to 0.5% of the Community’s GDP, and this figure could rise to as much as 1% of EU GDP by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I do have one piece of good news, however: the problems can be mitigated. Electronic stability control could save the lives of around 4 000 people every year, and if the in-vehicle emergency call system e-Call were fully deployed throughout Europe, the number of road injuries and fatalities could be reduced by as much as 5-15%. This would save more than 2 500 lives every year and represent financial savings of EUR 22 billion. Appropriate software and real-time information in traffic centres would enable a 40% reduction in congestion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is clear even from the few figures I have cited that intelligent vehicle systems have undeniable advantages, but use of these systems so far remains limited; in the United States, on the other hand, electronic stability control is to be made mandatory in all new cars from 2012. The primary reason why they are not more widespread is that these systems are expensive, and the appropriate information and intelligent infrastructure are lacking. We must ask ourselves, however, whether we can permit a situation in which the citizens of Europe are unable to enjoy their rights? You see, I believe every one of them, and every one of us too, has a right to safe, sustainable and efficient mobility.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Because mobility has increased and continues to rise constantly, the problems I have mentioned are European in scale, and if mobility is less than optimum or unsafe we must respond at European level. Market obstacles must be eliminated, demand for intelligent communication technologies must be fostered, and European-level, interoperable intelligent infrastructure must be developed. Results already achieved in European research and development in the field of information and communication technologies must be maintained and improved, especially with regard to appropriate driver-vehicle interaction. All these things are indispensible for the European economy and society, and they are also in the interests of European industry, given that the industrial sector in Japan and the United States (to cite only one or two examples) are major competitors. European decision-makers have recognised this, and this is why the Intelligent Car Initiative is a flagship project within the i2010 initiative.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Overall, therefore, I welcome the Communication from the European Commission, and I support the efforts being made by the parties concerned to expand appropriate deployment of intelligent information and safety technologies in vehicles. We must acknowledge that the process is still in its infancy, but we now have information on the developments that have taken place since the launch of the Intelligent Car Initiative. The work we have already done is not inconsiderable, and we are making reasonable progress. At the same time, however, I await the next progress report with great curiosity, and I am confident that I, too, with my modest resources, have contributed to the goal of fostering the deployment of life-saving, environmentally sound, traffic-optimising systems on as wide a scale as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last but not least, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who assisted me in my work: the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism; I thank my fellow members of this House and those who are unable to be here today for their comments and proposals for amendments, and I thank the professional organisations for all their useful advice, invitations and explanations. Thank you all for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gurmai, although I am standing in for Commissioner Reding who is competent for today’s debate, I consider the issue to be of extraordinary importance as it is part and parcel of the strategy which the Commission and my department are intending to pursue over the next few years, i.e. to reduce the number of road deaths in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have a duty to consider this initiative a political priority; citizens are watching us and young people in particular are expecting us to provide them with answers, advice, suggestions and ideas so that they can use the European Union’s roads without running the risk of losing their lives.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why today’s debate, like yesterday evening’s debate, is of extraordinary importance and why the events that the European Commission is organising are of extraordinary importance. An initiative for young people is to be held in Brussels on 10 July, giving them a chance to discuss road safety, and a series of events on road safety will take place during the French Presidency, the most important of which will be held in Paris on 13 October, although there will also be events geared towards action in this sector in other European cities, with a view to raising public awareness and in particular the awareness of young people.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of today’s debate I should like to thank Parliament as a whole and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and comprehensive report. I particularly welcome the fact that her report recognises the major potential of the technologies and systems promoted by the ‘intelligent car’ initiative. Parliament’s support is crucial if these systems are to filter down to road users.</p>
      <p sl="it">Citizens have been the focal point, the target, of this initiative from the very outset. As road users, citizens are having to face increasingly difficult choices in the area of mobility and the messages that the public and private sector are sending out are in some cases confusing or even conflicting. Therefore, I welcome Parliament’s call for the introduction of further measures, such as incentives, training for drivers and information campaigns for users, to help safer and more ecological vehicles to gain more of a market share.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is very encouraging, especially for me, as a Member of this Parliament for many years, to see this House recognising eCall as one of the key priorities of the ‘intelligent car’ initiative. We have made a great deal of progress as a result of eCall and at the end of this year the Commission will present a new communication to Parliament and the Council setting out the final stages for the achievement of eCall.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am also grateful to Parliament for its support for our efforts to discover the best way of achieving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions through intelligent technologies and for guiding us on the possible measures that could be taken. This sector is nevertheless only in its beginnings, and the regulation on CO2 emission reduction targets has for instance to be implemented; I am again thinking of further measures in the transport sector based in particular on an integrated approach. Parliament’s support in this respect will be crucial.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="1852" name="Dieter-Lebrecht Koch" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the public should be able to benefit in two ways from the potential for greater road safety. For this reason, along with the report we are discussing today, I call for more research into, and education about, the safety benefits of driver-assistance systems. Most people have no practical experience whatsoever of these systems and cannot therefore appreciate, first of all, that driver-assistance systems possess undisputed safety potential – after all, driver error is the cause of some 80% of road accidents – secondly, that they make driving less stressful, thirdly, that they support drivers and ease the burden on them without usurping their ultimate responsibility and, fourthly, that they encourage economical and environment-friendly driving behaviour. According to recent studies, driver-assistance systems could prevent up to one third of all serious accidents if all drivers used them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane-change assistance, and electronic stability control (ESC) are technically well developed and highly reliable. On the other hand they, too, must undergo regular technical inspection and must be tested after major accident repairs. Intelligent vehicle systems help to avoid risky situations altogether and, by easing the burden on drivers, are conducive to a more relaxed and foresighted driving style.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, these systems are not yet standard vehicle components. In spite of Vision Zero, traffic accidents will still happen in future. From the end of 2010 all new vehicles are to be equipped for the electronic satellite-based eCall emergency call system, so that professional help can be given within what doctors call the ‘golden hour’ immediately after an accident.</p>
      <p sl="de">Through the European emergency phone number 112, the emergency call centre and the emergency services receive rapid automatic notification of an accident and its precise location. Until the emergency services arrive, however, each of us should be able to administer first aid. In modern vehicle cockpits, however, there is also a danger of sensory overload. The increasingly complex operation of everyday functions such as air-conditioning, car radios and navigation systems, combined with audio and visual signals from assistance systems such as automatic parking systems, bumper-control devices, alcohol and overload interlocks and other devices can distract or even overburden drivers.</p>
      <p sl="de">For all this potential, there remains the problem of replacing the vehicle fleet. That is primarily an issue of affordability. Sadly, the average age of our vehicles is increasing rather than decreasing. Vehicles must remain affordable. That is our responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, let me express my warmest thanks to Mrs Gurmai for her outstanding work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues. I would like to congratulate Mrs. Gurmai for her report and I am convinced that, due to her as well, the roadmap to be drafted by the Commission in the autumn of 2008, for speeding up the introduction of incentives for intelligent cars, will be more ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Launched in 2006, the “Intelligent Car” initiative is a main project in the e2010, which represents the strategic framework of the Commission for the Information Society until 2010. One of the components of the eSafety programme is the implementation, by 2010, of the eCall system, which will automatically call the emergency services and supply data regarding the exact location of the vehicle. Nevertheless, it is important for the Member States to sign the memorandum of understanding. I support the introduction of this system as standard equipment for all new vehicles as of 2010.</p>
      <p sl="ro">4000 lives might be saved every year in Europe by introducing the Electronic Stability Control system, which reduces the risk of skidding. Unfortunately, according to the strategy of car manufacturers, these devices are available in a rather small proportion and often in a package of very expensive options. I believe it is not enough for us to set the goal that, as of 2012, the stability control system should be available for all models, but it is also important to introduce incentives for the purchaser to choose this option. It has been found that 60% of front-rear collisions could be avoided if drivers had brake assist systems and accident avoidance technology. Also, the visibility improvement systems equipping cars with adaptive headlights could reduce deadly accidents involving pedestrian victims by 30% and the number of accidents involving bicyclists by 15%.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I consider it is extremely important to ensure the confidentiality of data and I draw attention to the fact that the legal clarification of responsibility in the case of accidents for cars equipped with brake assist devices or skid control devices has become urgent. The car industry should adopt the European Code of Good Practice for development and testing of advanced assistance systems for manufacturers … for car drivers drafted by REPONSE.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I consider the existence of Community and national financial support schemes for the purchase of intelligent cars to be vital for the large-scale use of these systems. I would like to congratulate Mrs. Gurmai for her report and, indeed, we are waiting for an ambitious plan for the introduction of intelligent cars from the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, as we were saying here yesterday, you have come here in your new role at a particularly good time during our debate on transport.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During these few days we have been discussing various issues that are to improve road safety and the quality of transport. Two days ago we were speaking about the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, yesterday we were discussing the transportation of hazardous materials and safe road systems. Today we are considering vehicles themselves, that is, how to make the vehicles used by people on roads within the European Union as safe as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For us the goal is clear, which is to enable EU citizens to move about more effectively and make their lives more comfortable but, at the same time, they should feel safer, so that, thanks to our regulations, we can tell our electors, tell the people, that we have made a positive contribution. Specific measures taken by the European Parliament show the importance not just of this House, they also show that European legislation and European institutions bring something positive and tangible into the lives of everyone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should remember that when we are debating initiatives to make vehicles safer, there are two things to bear in mind. Firstly, it is the car itself and all the systems that we are considering: systems for speed control, for stability control, for maintaining distance between vehicles, all these support systems, together with navigation systems, are all very important things that improve the functioning of the car, which is the tool that is used by those travelling by road.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, we should also remember, and it is appropriate to point this out in these speeches, that, for our citizens, for those travelling by road, the issue of communications is also very important, should there be a tragedy, an accident, or some misfortune. Our citizens should feel confident that, thanks to technical equipment and the systems that we are introducing, they will get help as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Both these issues are very important. Both, that means effective information systems so that help can arrive in case of an accident and, at the same time, systems that improve the vehicles themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In discussing this report, which my political group supports, we have also to remember its limitations. First of all, when we speak of an intelligent car, we must not forget that a very important part of an intelligent car is an intelligent driver. This is no small matter and the educational issue is very important. We have found on a number of occasions that technological progress was not accompanied by improvements in safety. Why? Because, despite improved technology and faster cars, drivers felt impregnable when driving their cars. Better roads meant they could drive faster. For this reason the issue of education, showing what is useful in modern technology, but also its limitations, and also showing how drivers should not abuse the modern technologies that we, I hope, will implement, is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of market forces has also been raised, as there are no guarantees that the regulations introduced by ourselves, however good, useful, appropriate and beneficial for drivers they may be, will result in an immediate exchange of vehicles in favour of cars that we consider to be safer, more efficient and easier to use. There are no guarantees because there is, of course, the barrier of price. This barrier could severely restrict access to these vehicles. I am not a supporter of systems that involve funding and also, both for the Commission and for all of us, it is something of an intellectual challenge to know what to do, not just to make safer vehicles and better roads, but to make our citizens, the citizens of the European Union, want to use them and to have the financial capabilities needed for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank the rapporteur very much and to express my strong support for this report once again.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="28418" name="Sepp Kusstatscher" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, whom I greet as a newcomer to our Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, we have here a report with an abundance of suggestions. I can certainly compliment Mrs Gurmai on the wealth of ideas that been incorporated into this report with a view to enhancing the technical sophistication of the vehicles on our roads.</p>
      <p sl="de">By way of introduction, however, I cannot resist a remark on the expressions ‘intelligent vehicle’, ‘intelligent infrastructure’ and ‘intelligent safety devices’. As I have already said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I consider it downright unacceptable to apply this term to cars and roadways. Intellegentia, intellegere, intellegens – these Latin terms have to do with discernment, perception and understanding. They refer to the cognitive capacity of human beings, their ability to understand, to abstract, to solve problems and apply knowledge. From a purely linguistic point of view it is utter nonsense to speak of intelligent vehicles and intelligent roads!</p>
      <p sl="de">In the statement explaining her report, Mrs Gurmai writes, ‘Ever-increasing road traffic generates serious social and environmental problems: congestion of road networks and urban areas, damage to the environment and to public health, energy wastage, accidents and, above all, the needless loss of lives’. I wholeheartedly agree. Nor do I seek to deny that cleverly conceived technology of the kinds with which this document abounds can help to make road traffic less dangerous and kinder to the environment. It only goes a limited way, however, towards solving the real social and environmental problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have recently been in quite a few school classrooms. During these visits, I have taken the opportunity to ask several pupils from intermediate and senior secondary schools what they considered to be the main causes of the numerous road accidents. The first answers were always ‘too fast and dangerous speeds and drink-driving’. The solutions we are coming up with here, however, are almost exclusively the kind advanced by the motor industry, which seeks to sell more and more new and technically sophisticated vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="de">If rising fuel prices are a problem, if there is an urgent need to reduce energy consumption in general, if the irresponsibly high levels of CO2 emissions need to be lowered, and if we want to do something to combat climate change, we shall not put these things to rights with a philosophy of more and more, higher and higher, faster and faster, ever more sophistication and ever more mobility but much rather by adopting a different lifestyle, in which slower, more modest and thriftier are the order of the day.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one point I must dispute. The rapporteur writes, ‘For the consumer affordability is a key issue. Many consumers simply cannot afford the systems in question. It is therefore important that intelligent transport systems become affordable and widely available as soon as possible’. The Heidelberg-based Environmental and Forecasting Institute (UPI) calculated a few years ago that, once all direct and indirect transport costs have been taken into account, the average car in Germany is subsidised by the government, in other words by the taxpayer, to the tune of some EUR 3 000 a year. It is unacceptable that destruction of the environment and risks to public health should be subsidised. On the contrary, those who cause the damage should pay in accordance with the principle of cost transparency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Road construction and maintenance are not the only cost factors. There are also the use of land and the many forms of damage to nature and human health. Please do not misunderstand me, I am not opposed to better technology, but I am opposed to this blind faith in technology. If we want to subsidise mobility, we should primarily support rail travel, local public transport, cycling and walking. That would be more intelligent, healthier, safer and greener.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="28374" name="Wiesław Stefan Kuc" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the UEN Group">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the report by Zita Gurmai and the recommendations contained in it are one more step to improving road safety within the European Union. Most of us use vehicles on these roads. They are equipped with technologies that are constantly improving: catalytic converters, ABS, ASC, lights, seat belts and so on. However, as always, there is a ‘but’. Generally speaking, this electronic equipment is fitted to expensive cars that undergo safety tests, have crumple zones, and are fitted with many air bags or special belts. These vehicles can withstand almost any accident but, unfortunately, most of the vehicles on our roads are medium or low priced. What is even more important is that sales of these cars is constantly increasing and, according to the automobile magazines, we shall soon be inundated by a wave of cheap cars from India, China and other countries. Obviously price is linked to quality and equipment. Cars costing between EUR 2 000 and EUR 5 000 have little other than an engine, steering wheel, wheels, seats and, possibly in some countries, a single seat belt.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is very encouraging that, in such a situation, there are people who are trying to make us safer. Prices are constantly falling and compulsory equipment can be constantly extended. Not just seat belts or ecological engines. Perhaps, in the future, ABS or automatic stability control systems, ASC, may become compulsory.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to congratulate Zita Gurmai on her innovative report. I am sure that, despite the complicated names and functioning of these items of equipment, the report will be greeted with understanding and support. We are trying to combat an enormous number of fatal accidents and our political group will support this report, as we did the previous ones that were discussed yesterday by my fellow Members.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="1969" name="Johannes Blokland" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the IND/DEM Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Gurmai, for her report. She has chosen the right approach. Mr Kusstatscher is of course right in his philosophical criticism of the term 'intelligent car'. Obviously we are talking here about artificial intelligence and so we also have to include that word.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are three points that need to be made clear in the resolution on the intelligent car. Firstly, the development of the intelligent car must be in the interests of a clean environment. Secondly, its development must have a positive effect on road safety. I am pleased that those points were also made clear in the report by Mrs Gurmai. I should also like to make the following comments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, I think it is important that an effort is made when developing the intelligent car to meet the European Union environmental targets. The report mentions that the European Commission objective is for new passenger cars and light-duty vehicles vans not to emit more than an average of 120 grams per kilometre of CO2. I would add that the objective for 2020 is 80 grams per kilometre. I believe that the development of intelligent cars can also be helpful in reaching that target. In the sustainable development of energy sources for cars, there are certainly a number of other intelligent possibilities for achieving CO2 emission targets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, I would say that the development of intelligent cars is also in the interests of road safety. The report has discussed that at length, so I shall not say any more about it here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As far as recital J is concerned, it must be clear that, regardless of whether technological progress makes drivers feel safer and therefore less responsible, it is up to each individual driver to drive carefully. That principle still has to apply and it is excellent if drivers are reminded of it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My final comments are on the report as a whole. It is very important that the development of intelligent cars should not be looked at separately from the development of an intelligent car environment. That combination in particular offers many possibilities for reducing pollution and improving road safety. A good traffic system is of vital importance to society. We do need to face up to the fact that transport is at the expense of the environment and will continue to be associated with accidents.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the development of intelligent transport systems can certainly help to minimise these negative effects of transport. I should therefore like to draw attention again to recital 13. I expect strong support from the Member States and the European Commission for the introduction of ecological and vehicle safety arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also stress that it is important for knowledge of intelligent transport systems to be properly shared out. It is, after all, likely that the knowledge will be available in Member States that, comparatively speaking, suffer less from the negative effects of transport that I mentioned earlier. In that case, it would be good for a system to be developed that, on the one hand, ensures that this important knowledge is also made available in Member States that have a strong interest in it and, on the other hand, takes due account of the intellectual property rights of the developers of the intelligent transport systems. In my opinion, the Member States should make clear arrangements between themselves on that point.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="28457" name="Luca Romagnoli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mrs Gurmai on the raft of ideas she has put forward; I have to say that there is so much human and artificial intelligence in this report and I hope that the former will always take precedence over the latter as otherwise we are opening up a different can of worms, and while one of our objectives must therefore be to propose safer, cleaner and more intelligent vehicles, our objective must also be, as proposed, to halve the number of deaths on our roads by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Italy there was, until recently, a terrifying advert on the television; it showed the disappearance, from the Italian landscape, of a whole village, a whole municipality equivalent to and of the same demographic size as those 40 thousand and more European citizens who disappear from our Europe every year. Every step must therefore be taken to bring about a drastic reduction of the number of deaths, and also to reduce the numbers of people who do not die who represent an enormous social cost because so many of them are disabled for life or have other levels of disability and weigh heavily on our social systems and on our consciences, and therefore everything has to be done from that point of view.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree that technology applied to vehicles and infrastructure is extremely important for safety – no stone can be left unturned when it comes to safety and assistance, as Mr Piskorski and Mr Kuc have said – but it is also necessary for drivers to be intelligent and informed. In my opinion, therefore, drastic measures are also needed to limit speed and step up the sanctions that can be taken when drivers are liable, and here I have to say that the new Italian Government is also coming up with some interesting answers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wonder, for instance, by what criterion cars capable of unthinkable speeds are still being marketed and, to take up Mr Kusstatscher, if there is no intelligence on the part of consumer motorists who buy cars of this kind and drive them in our towns and cities, then the responsibility lies with those who administer and are responsible for deciding on the freedom of persons who can never be allowed to limit the freedom of others who are unfortunately often physically eliminated in such cases.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="4461" name="Luís Queiró" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report under discussion here, whose draftsman I would like to congratulate, is an excellent opportunity to combine the best aspect of technological development with the most important aspect of road safety, which is safety itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The development of new information and communication technologies has made it possible to achieve the political and social objective of reducing the number of victims of road accidents, that avoidable scourge of European roads.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the potential thus made available is to be exploited to the full, however, awareness-raising campaigns must include brief, clear and comprehensible information on the new intelligent vehicle systems and must reach the largest audience possible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important to ensure that the development and deployment of ICT-based ‘intelligent vehicle systems’ is increasingly accepted at international level, and the need remains to ensure that Member States and industry encourage and support investment in such systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">An integrated approach to these problems will also allow a variety of common safety and environmental objectives to be taken into account, particularly in connection with infrastructure and driver behaviour, as many of our fellow Members have already stressed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The truth is, however, that not all aspects of this process are functioning well. The marketing of these systems is still weak. Their high costs, which even now mean that the safest cars are luxury cars for many people, and the lack of dissemination and awareness-raising campaigns on their benefits prevent greater market penetration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore very important to ensure that the negotiations to make the eCall system standard on all new vehicles from 2010 are successful, as the Commissioner has already said. It is estimated that this initiative alone could save up to 2 500 lives every year after it is fully rolled out in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another fundamental aspect of this report, Mr President and Commissioner, is the objective of a 100% take-up of electronic stability control for all new vehicles from 2012, something that will also save thousands of lives and avoid many injuries on European roads every year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he is in a position to assure us that this objective still stands for the date scheduled, 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must all feel once again that we are involved in combating death on European roads by seeking effective and sustained solutions for applying the new technologies to the road transport sector. It is consequently essential for the interested parties to coordinate their activity and for the Commission and Member States to support research into new information technologies, and for drivers to be made aware of their safety benefits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In short, everyone must work together to make these systems a commonplace and financially accessible product on the market so that consumer demand for them increases.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur for her work on bringing this initiative forward to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped. Of course, this has a Europe-wide dimension, because cars are made in nearly every European country (far fewer are made, I have to say, in the United Kingdom than they were before). People drive cars that are French, Italian or German, that are made in Spain or Britain and assembled elsewhere and, of course, we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards. If this means, through this initiative, that we can save lives through getting medical aid around and we can help people who might not otherwise have done to survive when they have an accident, then this is something that the British citizen and the citizens of the other European countries and Ireland should be able to gauge into.</p>
      <p sl="en">We may look at this initiative and think this is very much futuristic and not going to happen for while. But it was not such a long time ago – I am thinking of 30 years ago when I got my first car, and I look around the room and perhaps Members here may have got their first car longer ago than that – that cars did not automatically have radios in them. Now, I do not know whether it is possible to buy a car without a radio, CD player or those sorts of things. Now cars, as the previous speaker said, are made to go faster and faster and are more sophisticated than ever: satellite navigation systems, e-systems, as we are talking about here, will be in cars very shortly and they will probably be standard in 20 years’ time. This is something we should welcome, and we should spread the news. Therefore, I congratulate all involved.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, fitting cars with automatic stability control systems and automatic accident notification has become today’s challenge. There are many arguments in favour. The first of these is the need to improve the safety of drivers and other road users. There are 41 600 fatal accidents on European roads each year. The resultant disability as well as harm to the health of many more thousands of road users is a strong argument for all of us. There would be many fewer fatalities if emergency assistance came earlier to those in need, so the introduction of an automatic accident notification system is a vital solution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A third important factor that has a significant impact on the number of accidents is the state of the roads. Investment in roads is vital, especially in the new Member States and in backward regions with poor infrastructure. When modernising and extending road networks it is important to pay attention to the surroundings. Roadside trees growing right next to roads are a significant factor increasing the number of fatalities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation in the automotive industry does not just mean vehicle safety or the safety of people. It also involves reducing harmful environmental effects caused by CO2 emissions from cars. It is good that the rapporteur has also addressed this problem as well as many other issues. For this reason I would like to give my warm appreciation for a job well done.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The only thing I cannot agree with is the name ‘intelligent car’. I agree with the previous speaker, who said that this concept is reserved for sentient beings. If we follow this line of reasoning, then we shall finish up with a situation where ‘intelligent cars’ will be driven by technically efficient drivers. In such a situation, whom would we involve in the educational activities that are so important to improve road safety and to benefit from civilisation’s technical achievements?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am the rapporteur on the subject of urban mobility, and my main task at the present time is undoubtedly to induce our House to vote on the report, which has already been dealt with by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, in the course of the July part-session, so that we can send out the right signals in good time for the Commission’s action plan on urban mobility, which is due to appear in the autumn. One of these signals relates directly to the subject of our debate today.</p>
      <p sl="de">In general, but especially in our towns and cities, we are finding it increasingly difficult to raise enough money for major developments to our hardware, by which I mean our roads. There are also numerous good reasons for not doing so. Accordingly, we need to use the appropriate software, in other words intelligent vehicles and equally intelligent organisation of traffic flows, to ensure that better use is made of the scarce resource that is our road network. Congestion, then, is one problem for which we undoubtedly need new and better technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context we organised a hearing as part of our deliberations in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where we were told by the industry representatives – not entirely surprisingly – that anything was possible. Many things are possible, but the motor industry needs timely signals on the one hand, while care must be taken on the other hand to ensure that these driver-assistance systems, once developed, are fitted to the great bulk of vehicles and do not remain the preserve of a privileged few who can afford very well-equipped cars.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is an argument that has rightly been advanced during our discussion today. It cannot be a matter of reserving the best new technological developments for a very few vehicles, leaving the large mass of drivers, in fact, with the same old problems, compounded by the fact that the systems are not really compatible with each other. Accordingly, if we really want to explore the subject of traffic movements and the problems they cause us along with the opportunities offered to us by personal mobility, we need a large number of very closely coordinated actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context let me put forward one final argument, to which Mr Koch rightly referred. New, good, improved technology can make cars safer and road traffic less dangerous, but it can also be misused and foster a misconception among drivers that, since their car can do everything, they no longer really need to devote much attention to safe driving. Relaxed driving is a fine thing, but I believe it is far more important to drive safely and, above all, to be aware of the consequences of one’s driving behaviour. This is, therefore, another area in which we must not lose sight of the psychological impact of new developments.</p>

In addition to her intellectual input, she also conducted a number of promotional activities and has really put everything she had into this report. Our warm appreciation and thanks to the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today we are talking of an intelligent car. Let us not worry about whether the description ‘intelligent’ is good or not. Yesterday we were talking about intelligent roads, without actually calling them intelligent roads. Yesterday we had many more reservations than today. Today we understand each other better. There is of course a third factor, which is the intelligent driver. What should the driver’s intelligence involve? Firstly, he should want to benefit from an intelligent car. We need to convince drivers that there is an economic calculation to be made. How much pain are we ready to suffer, how many days in hospital, to save EUR 1 000 by buying a less technologically advanced vehicle? To be aware that this technologically advanced car and road can mean fewer accidents, less serious accidents, and a better quality of life and that this can be within our reach provided that, and I repeat, that we understand that it is worth spending those EUR 1 000 on this new technology.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I just first of all warmly welcome Antonio Tajani and congratulate him on his appointment. It is very important that he is here for this significant debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to pay tribute first of all to Zita Gurmai, who has done an excellent piece of work, not just in putting this report together but also in promoting the whole of the Intelligent Car eSafety programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I just want to say to the Commission that it is a remarkable example of how a Commission initiative can bring people together across their own services, because as you will know Mrs Reding and her predecessor Mr Liikanen were actively involved in this. I am pleased to see my friends André Vits and Juhani Jaaskelainen sitting behind the Commissioner, because they have been instrumental in engaging all the participants together and really making progress; and I echo what Robert Evans says, it is a remarkable example of how the European institutions can cooperate together without heavyweight legislation and with a clear vision to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">My only regret today, Mr President – and I hope you will take this up on behalf of Parliament – is that the other principal actors in the whole of the Intelligent Car programme are notably absent from the front row here, because the Council has a crucial responsibility here. The Member States are responsible in large part for much of the detailed legislation that will help introduce these programmes and help our citizens. Where are they here to listen to this debate?</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to make a couple of remarks to follow up what colleagues have said about the crucial issues of cars and roads. Let me say to colleagues who have talked about safety features in vehicles that the whole process of evolution of the industry has been one of technological progress; indeed it is true that safety innovations have started first on more expensive cars with lower volumes, and have then trickled down to become available on cheaper cars. Now all cars sold in the European Union will have anti-lock braking systems. That is an intelligent system because intelligence, in my view, is collecting and using information. This is what these systems do. Once you have that information collection system on, you can then use it for anti-skid systems. The incremental cost is much lower.</p>
      <p sl="en">But if we have the eCall system, then we have all cars equipped with that external information-collection system which is what we want to interact with the intelligent highway systems too, where we are also collecting information.</p>
      <p sl="en">Back in my region – and by the way, Robert Evans, the United Kingdom is now producing cars close to its historic high level and we have more car producers making cars in the United Kingdom than any other European Union country, so please do not run down our car industry – on my local motorway, we have Britain’s first intelligent highway which opens lanes and controls speeds according to the traffic flow, and I can tell you that not only does traffic flow more smoothly, but fuel consumption has also been improved: it is a win-win-win situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what this is all about. It is about winning by using intelligence and I hope you will all support it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to congratulate my colleague Zita Gurmai because she has done something wonderful – she has mastered and prepared an excellent report in an area that would appear to be very technical and ‘masculine’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We live in a society dominated by information technology. This kind of equipment is with us from dawn to dusk. We found out very quickly that it makes life easier and we quickly learned to benefit from it. For this reason it has been an excellent development that, as part of the overall strategy of the Information Society and Media, the European Commission has found an issue that touches us very closely, namely the safety of people and road safety, and has prepared this ‘intelligent car’ initiative. I like the name ‘intelligent car’, I do not have any issues with it, as I understand that it is being used figuratively. It is an interesting name, ‘intelligent car’, it attracts people’s attention, catches the media, it is not meant literally. For me, this name is a symbol of modern European transport which, thanks to new information and communications technology, will become even safer, more ecological and more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The primary purpose of the intelligent car is to help people. In second place are the benefits for the environment, and thirdly it should make European transport more efficient. I do not know if the intelligent car will need enormous promotion and advertising. People are naturally curious and like to buy novelties, especially when they are financially accessible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that, even if this type of car is a bit more expensive, that everyone who buys it will feel they are investing in their own safety. I also believe that they will not feel they have wasted those few euros in ensuring their safety. The only thing I would say is that users have not only to know what there is in the intelligent car, but also to know how it works, and need to learn how to operate the modern technology to which so often we have a theoretical access, but never actually use.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to see that as part of its safety brief, the ‘intelligent car’ should disallow use of mobile telephones and that mobile telephones in cars should be installed in such a way that they do not take the driver’s attention away from the road.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My last point is that even the most intelligent car packed with all the latest gadgets and technology will not fulfil our expectations if the driver makes a mistake and if the road system in Europe is not as good as it already is in certain European Union countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, it is a great pleasure for me to address you in your new position. I congratulate Madame Gurmai for this extremely necessary report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Dear colleagues, the price of oil has increased alarmingly and the efforts to replace traditional fuels have not produced the forecasted results yet and, for the moment, solutions are either too expensive, or controversial, or insufficiently tested from the technological point of view. Nevertheless, the car remains the most popular means of transport for Europeans and, unfortunately, this preference causes numerous problems, both from the social point of view and as regards the environment protection, as well as accidents with material damage and, especially, human losses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The large-scale use of intelligent transportation systems and, first of all, of the electronic stability control is necessary. This way, thousands of human lives can be saved, pollution can be reduced, traffic can be decongested and both the car drivers’ comfort and safety and the relations between road traffic partners can be improved. Member States and private entrepreneurs should get involved ever more actively both in developing and implementing the eSafety initiatives, and in designing new accident avoidance systems, new materials and types of sensors interconnecting both the cars and the cars with the roads. It is clear that the “Intelligent Car” initiative cannot be separated from the intelligent road initiative. I support without any reserve the Commission’s proposal to launch a programme for implementing cooperative driving systems, as well as ensuring the availability of the related radio frequencies, whose benefits are visible in experimental phases in various countries and, with all costs involved, will produce long-term results.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is true that these systems address mainly the highway and TEN-T traffic. I insist on the fact that, over time, it is imperative for the differences between the major infrastructures and the other categories of roads to diminish, especially in the new Member States. It is necessary for Member States to efficiently use the European funds provided to them and also find other financial and technical solutions to draw up and put into practice long-term strategies for implementing assisted and cooperative driving in areas that are truly problematic as well: on national, regional and local roads, bypass routes for the transport of goods, on linking roads with conurbations from … in peri-urban areas and in the cross-border sectors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Also, the European Commission and the Member States should continue their efforts to harmonize the legislative framework for eCall, as well as for the emergency telephone number 112, which are the pillars of essential safety and to consolidate durable mobility and for the welfare of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate our colleague, Zita Gurmai, on her achievement with this report on the Intelligent Car Initiative. We are well aware that in terms of the development of society, mobility is a source of wealth, growth and, consequently, the capacity to promote solidarity between territories and between people. If we want sustainable development we must combine the various transport modes to improve the traffic flow in towns and in the country. Although we certainly do not want to build our society around the car as in the past, the motor vehicle nonetheless remains a vital means of achieving the intelligent and sustainable mobility to which we aspire. If we want to make that a reality, we must design intelligent and sustainable vehicles, based on three requirements: they must be safer, cleaner and more intelligent. Over and above that statement of principle, Europe must give practical support to this initiative with directives and policies that will, in the long run, integrate all the electronic systems, nomadic or not, and make it possible to control the processes and to drive cars that are safer and cleaner, with lower CO2 and particulate emissions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To that end, we must encourage car makers to consider even at this stage introducing all these electronic systems into the design of new cars, with a view not just to greater efficiency and ease of driving but also, as a result of all this, to reducing costs and simplifying manufacturing and installation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want to achieve sustainable mobility, we must also broaden the scope of these policies. Research projects and innovations should eventually generate intelligent roads, which will improve safety, reduce energy costs, use dialogue between vehicles and improve traffic flows. The European Union wants to promote a knowledge-based society and sustainable development. These initiatives must take pride of place in that context.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me conclude by emphasising the vital need to be really ambitious, to set ambitious targets and create the conditions for growth and progress in Europe. Echoing the report by our colleague Zita Gurmai, the European Parliament is convinced that the Commission will respond to that expectation and to these needs by setting a new frontier for the European intelligent car and finally allocating the necessary funding to achieve that ambition.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I support the report by the rapporteur Mrs Gurmai. Mr Vice-President, the time has arrived to implement intelligent transport systems and in doing so to open up a new era in the history of European transport. We know that implementation of intelligent transport systems is one of the most important instruments – we could even say weapons – at our disposal if we wish to respond appropriately to climate change. Just two years ago, here in a plenary session of the European Parliament, I said that, in my opinion, one of the most significant challenges facing transport today is clearly that of making intelligent transport systems widely available in Europe. Then, one year later, I presented the European Parliament’s review of the White Paper on European Transport Policy to this House, and Parliament unequivocally supported intelligent transport, as it does now, as one of the key priorities of European transport policy. Why, then, are we making such slow progress? The technology is widely available.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This includes the intelligent car, for example, and ICT-based urban traffic management systems; the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) will be on stream from 2009, and the Galileo system from 2013. One of European industry’s great strengths is its automotive sector, where we are highly successful in global competition, not least thanks to highly innovative small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the sector. Nowadays, moreover, developments in this sector span western and eastern Europe. In Budapest, for example, there are two important knowledge centres of European-level significance operating alongside the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The sector is therefore committed. Now it is time for action on the part of the Community, and above all on the part of the Member States. In the case of the Equal programme, for example, it must ensure that the necessary infrastructure investment is in place; in the case of the intelligent car and intelligent infrastructure initiative, it must provide an appropriate economic environment to foster their development. Of course it is not easy to introduce new technologies, but we can help to promote this process by means of judicious public procurement. We have a plethora of instruments at our disposal. We ask the Commission to draw up an appropriate, cross-sectoral strategy to facilitate implementation of intelligent transport systems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Europe’s citizens waste valuable minutes, indeed hours, travelling. Meanwhile, vehicles pollute the atmosphere unnecessarily and personal mobility is under threat, in part because the price of fuel for vehicles used in this way is becoming prohibitive. Intelligent transport is a key component of the solution to these problems. As far as European citizens are concerned, people are now open to consider any means of resolving the problems outlined here. Let us therefore take action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Zita, our rapporteur, for this report. I know you, Zita, as someone who, when she tackles anything, does so with a ready wit, determination, intelligence and vigour. In my opinion, that is precisely the spirit that underlies this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also like to take the opportunity to follow up a point that Mrs Grabowska made. I do not believe that cars are something that should be mainly for men. I am more inclined to take the opposite view. If we can trust the statistics that exist on this subject, women drive with greater foresight and care and more safely. In other words, they drive more intelligently, and I believe this is one of the reasons why it was only right that a woman drafted this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">To come to the point, we are all aware that road traffic consumes a great deal of energy and emits huge volumes of exhaust fumes throughout Europe. It is one of the main risks to human life in Europe. Large numbers of people die or are injured in road accidents every year. It is therefore important that the European legislature should try to reduce these figures. Accordingly, it is imperative that vehicles should be made more intelligent in the truest sense of the term, so that these things do not happen so often in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe this report points in the right direction. The key to success, however – and I agree entirely with Mr Rack here – is that these systems should be available to the great mass of car owners, that they have a general impact and do not remain the privilege, as it were, of a small class of people. I believe the report expresses that view quite clearly too. This is why I believe it is right for us to adopt it today.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is a serious problem. We cannot forget the 42 000 deaths in 2005. I cannot forget that Portugal recorded 150 fatalities per 1 000 000 inhabitants in 1993, although these figures have been falling.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The contribution of this report and our colleague’s work is crucial, and there are two aspects I would like to highlight.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nowadays mobility is essential to the running of European society. We all depend on transport in our everyday lives, and the intensity of transport and mobility causes increasing social and environmental problems. The appropriate response must therefore be given in stages, but it does have to be given and given quickly. The constraints facing consumers and the automobile industry must be taken into account, but they must not prevent us from achieving the objective of safety.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second aspect is information. Consumers must be informed about intelligent infrastructures and cars. Information must be clear and comprehensible and must be given at the right time. Car dealers and sales staff, all the agents involved, Member States, regions and local authorities have a great responsibility in this area, as does the media. Such cooperation must be ensured by the European Union, because on our own we cannot achieve the final objective, which is without doubt the objective of the Commission and of our rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="es">Of course, it is technology this is coming to the fore, and all the proposals she makes in her enterprising report will help us to continue making progress in the logistical development to which the European Union is committed.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also believe that after the agreement reached about the deployment of Galileo, the ‘intelligent’ car is going to be one of the initiatives that will add content to the Galileo deployment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Yesterday, without going further, we approved the Directive on road safety infrastructure, which already highlighted the need to develop intelligent and interactive systems and vehicles. If we already have the infrastructure, all we clearly need is the intelligent vehicle.</p>
      <p sl="es">The intelligent car will also help improve the prevention and control of traffic offences, especially regarding interaction with traffic lights, speed limits and anti-alcohol blocking. In the field of road safety, of course, everything connected with mass sensors for pedestrians and other vulnerable toad users will be crucial.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the eSafety system, which is too far behind schedule, Commissioner, we have already called for it to be included in all vehicles and not only in premium vehicles and Mrs Gurmai wants to see this implemented as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we had also envisaged that it would include vehicles for occupational use, especially in agriculture, where the isolation of the driver make the consequences of any accident worse as time passes.</p>
      <p sl="es">I ask you, Commissioner, when will we be able to include the eSafety system in occupational vehicles, in particular agricultural vehicles?</p>

      <p sl="sk">As a physician I want to add that an intelligent European driver should also be much better prepared in terms of administering first aid in the event of an accident. A driver needs to be trained on an ongoing basis, not just in theory but by means of suitable practical accident simulation training, so that he or she is prepared, can react correctly and can administer good first aid, thereby saving more lives in a stressful accident situation. Since saving lives is one of the goals of the initiative in question, I wished to briefly mention this issue.</p>

Next, control and enforcement along the entire chain to ensure road safety. The rapporteur deserves full credit for this initiative and for the excellent quality of this report. Road safety is of extreme importance to all of us because the measures that need to be adopted save lives. The "intelligent car" initiative is not merely about technical solutions.

I support the rapporteur’s view that at present penetration rates for intelligent car systems and applications remain very low in relation to their potential. I am also convinced that we must fully exploit these systems and applications in due course. Intelligent cars also need the support of an intelligent infrastructure but the ‘intelligent road’ is not yet ready. It is quite clear that the active safety elements in cars help to reduce the number of road accident fatalities. The eCall system is an effective additional feature of the overall system for protecting road users. I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Only in that way will we close the gap between the peoples of Europe and the institutions. The best response that we can give to the sceptics, those who voted ‘no’ in the referendums, is to show that Europe is close to citizens; we have to send out a positive message and have the courage to press ahead and make it understood that people, that citizens’ needs, are our top priority, and I am therefore pleased to take up your invitation, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="it">Road safety will be, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Directorate-General which answers to the Commissioner for Transport is concerned, the priority – I said so in the speech through which I was able to gain the confidence of this House, which I thank again, having been here for so many years, for the confidence it has shown in me – as I was saying, the safety of citizens: the individual has to be at the heart of our initiative.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have listened to the whole of this debate with a great deal of interest, and there was indeed a resolve today on the part of the institutions to provide answers, to save human lives; every human life that we are capable of saving through our legislative work, through our commitment, will be commendable work that will be to our credit. It is for that reason that we need to press ahead and for that reason that I share the stance of so many Members who have today stressed the importance of intelligent instruments and intelligent cars, although we have to ensure beforehand that man is intelligent because the first responsibility lies with citizens at the wheel who have to be aware that there are other citizens whose lives depend on their actions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Technology undoubtedly has to be at the service of man, the human and fundamental element, and it is for that reason that I share the stance of those – and I said this during my presentation speech – who argue that drivers need to be educated, that citizens need to be informed about the new instruments that technology and research enable us to place at the service of the citizen. Otherwise, it is pointless to spend public money, or private money, on research, if the discoveries that are made, if the initiatives that are brought to a successful conclusion are not placed at the service of citizens in order to save human lives. It is for that reason, I repeat, that the road safety sector will be a priority – and that is a commitment which I formally make to the European Parliament – and one of the main undertakings that the Commission and the transport sector will pursue in forthcoming months.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like briefly to answer the question raised by Mr Pribetich as regards timing. On the basis of the results of a consultation launched on 23 May 2008, the European Commission has proposed a regulation on type-approval requirements for the general safety of vehicles which states that, from 2012, electronic stability control systems are to be installed in new vehicles in order significantly to improve the safety of those vehicles. The regulation refers to the technical regulations harmonised within the World Forum of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">In reply to Mrs Ayala Sender, as regards heavy vehicles, in November 2007 the UNECE World Forum for harmonisation of vehicle regulations approved a text relating to the compulsory installation of ESC and related technical standards. That text has been supported by the European Commission which means that it will be compulsory to install ESC in new models of the most common categories of heavy vehicles from 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the occupational vehicles to which she referred, especially those in the agricultural sector – in Europe there are unfortunately still deaths from accidents caused by agricultural vehicles, in some cases as a result of the irresponsibility of drivers failing to drive with due care – at present no provision has been made, as priority has been given to cars and heavy vehicles. I welcome her suggestion, however, as regards my own area of competence and I shall also pass it on to Commissioner Reding because it seems to me to be an important proposal and would meet a need in rural areas in particular. In the agricultural sector, I repeat, there are unfortunately still many deaths which are not deaths on roads but on agricultural land and we cannot pretend that this is not a problem.</p>
      <p sl="it">For that reason, I thank you, Mrs Ayala Sender, for your suggestion, and I thank all the Members who have spoken; the Commission, I reiterate – I am concluding, Mr President, and I apologise if I have taken a few extra minutes, but I feel that this issue is important enough for us to overrun the times laid down by the rules. As I was saying, we welcome the report by Mrs Gurmai who I also thank for her enthusiasm, because we have to show that we are enthusiastic about our commitment to defending the rights of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">I welcome Parliament’s encouragement, its support for the eCall system and the measures to promote its implementation, and I therefore believe that the outcome of today’s debate is positive because the Commission, Parliament and I hope the Council, Mr President, have agreed to be on the side of citizens through this endeavour to save as many human lives as possible.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of Europe, thank you very much for your comments and opinions. I believe this is indeed a new era in the history of European transport, as my fellow Member Etelka Barsi-Pataky put it. It is very important that everyone present in this House has voiced support for the report; it is a plain fact that one has to be as green as possible in order to please the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and we are delighted that in the end they too have given their support to this report. I must stress how very important this is. I agree with you, Commissioner, that if we manage to save even one single life on the roads, then we have achieved something; you see, I believe that the most important thing we can do as European decision-makers is to protect human lives. Several of you have cited the shocking statistic: 41 600 people die on the roads.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I also thank you for your support because in order to bring this matter to a conclusion we need to have everyone on board. I am very proud of Viviane Reding and her team, André and Juhani, who are sitting here. They have seen this whole process through. Not just over the past month, but over the past few years, because the technologies had to be tested to see if they really worked. Do you remember there was a time when there were no safety belts, and now we take them for granted? Or, as Robert Evans put it, there is a radio in every car nowadays. The new technologies will one day become as natural as safety belts and radios are today. We need the citizens of Europe, who will buy these intelligent systems once they have clearly seen the benefits they can bring. It is important also to have the vehicle manufacturers on our side, because 17 million cars are produced annually in Europe and 2 million people are employed in this sector. It is important that the Member States should be with us on this issue, although I must concur with Malcolm Harbour: the Council is notably absent.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There is little point in the Commission and the European Parliament doing everything in their power if the Council does not take this matter sufficiently seriously. The Council must be aware, however, that it too needs to represent the citizens of Europe. Let us therefore work together. I am asking you this because actions speak louder than words. It is in our common interest to recognise that everyone stands to gain if we achieve results in this area, as we will be able to travel in safety, traffic will be optimal, environmental pollution can be reduced, and Europe’s industrial sector can become a leader in the field of information and communication technologies. This is an opportunity to make a real difference. Let us not miss our chance.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thank you for your attention. I am very optimistic that Commissioner Tajani will do everything in his power to make this dream a reality.</p>

They are getting a little bit from me, but I wonder if it would be possible for you and your assistants to go back to the relevant authorities and look for a way of ensuring that, in the event of the debate finishing at 11.30, as it has done this morning, with nothing scheduled until 14.00, something could be put in to fill the half-hour gap between now and 12 noon, whether it be the urgencies from this afternoon or something else of mind-boggling importance?</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain my vote on the European Parliament resolution on stepping up the Union’s disaster response capacity. Certainly the document’s tone of solidarity and mutual help is a step in the right direction. The Barnier report challenges us to take practical steps and in this regard the Commission communication shows the way forward. Indeed we must ensure compatibility and strengthen cross-border cooperation between our countries’ protection forces at different levels. Unfortunately, I was unable to support the resolution because our oral amendment was not adopted. In this amendment we oppose creating legally binding instruments that would affect national legislation, policies and programmes and so affect the element of solidarity. I simply believe that we will achieve better protection against the impact of disasters by supporting the protection forces in our Member States, through coordination and investment in their equipment, not by drawing up new legislation that will do nothing more for the whole process than create more bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Since 1968 the Customs Union has played a crucial role in preserving and developing the single market. Forty years of the Customs Union has been a substantial achievement and it has provided benefits for EU business and citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome the resolution by Mrs Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union and I voted in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Due to globalisation and technological progress, the Customs Union is having to cope with challenges such as counterfeit goods, increased imports of dangerous products and the need to set up electronic customs systems. Only mutual cooperation between the customs administrations and surveillance authorities at international level will be able to protect the EU market against imports of dangerous and counterfeit products, thereby strengthening consumer protection. I became convinced of this when visiting the national customs authorities and customs administrations in Prague, Antwerp and Washington, as well as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This anniversary is a suitable occasion to thank customs officials for their demanding and often dangerous work, and for expressing our appreciation of the successes they achieve in their fight against dangerous products, counterfeit products and piracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the 40th anniversary seems an opportune moment to address a misapprehension that has existed, I think, in our country ever since your constituents and mine voted to join what they thought was the Common Market some 35 years ago – the misapprehension concerning the difference between a free-trade area and a customs union.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I think most British people understood by the Common Market was that there would be mutual product recognition, that if you could sell something in the UK, you should also be allowed to sell it in Germany, France and Spain and the other way round.</p>
      <p sl="en">But of course what we have instead is standardisation. Something is required to contain certain ingredients, to be of a volume of not less than ‘x’ and not more than ‘y’, and even if that product was never intended for export, even if it never crosses frontiers, it can find itself criminalised and prohibited in its own country; and this is often because a rival somewhere in the EU – as often as not in Britain – which happens to meet all of a group of specifications anyway, uses the mechanisms of the European Union in order to pass on its costs to its rivals.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is a shame that we have lost the original concept of free circulation of goods and services in favour of harmonisation, which reduces consumer choice.</p>

      <p sl="en">When I give speeches in my constituency of London – for those of you who may have heard of London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world – it is often pointed out to me by my constituents that they thought in 1973 that we were joining a customs union. Then I say, ‘Do you not understand the nature of the beast? Do you not understand the nature of the European project? It is all about further political and economic integration’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact in my first week in Parliament the leader of my group, Hans-Gert Pöttering, stood up and said, ‘Nothing must be allowed to get in the way of European integration; nothing must be allowed to get in the way of the European project’. So clearly, there is a misapprehension of the nature of the project in my constituency.</p>
      <p sl="en">My plea to you, those of you in this Chamber who support the project, is: please be honest about its intentions. If you seek to deny the truth about this project, then, once you ask the people, they will reject it, as they did in the referendum in Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I too am delighted to see you in the chair.</p>
      <p sl="en">I voted for Amendment 6 because I believe that the authorisation of the chlorinated chicken imports would undermine European standards and I see that happening on two fronts. First of all, there is a lack of scientific data on the environmental and health impact of using the substances that are proposed. Secondly, given the regime under which poultry producers operate, it is unreasonable to have two different standards, both from the perspective of the producers and more importantly from that of the consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The previous speaker mentioned the Lisbon referendum in Ireland. Certainly one of the issues on the ground that I came across when canvassing was that people do object to different standards. But what we are doing here in Parliament today is dealing with that, so I am delighted that Parliament has passed that resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">The fishing industry is in crisis, with fuel prices having increased by more than 300% in the last five years while prices for fish are similar to those paid 20 years ago. So the bottom line is that fishermen cannot survive, they are going out of business and I think some of our proposals in this resolution will help to improve the situation.</p>

But what I would say to my colleagues in the House is, actually, let us look at what the real problem is. Whenever there is an international crisis, you seek to blame that for the problems in the fishing industry. Actually it is not the rise in fuel prices that is the real problem in the fishing industry. It is the common fisheries policy, a system of central planning that the Soviets would have been proud of. I find it amazing that colleagues in this House are so willing to espouse Soviet economics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at some of the more successful fish preservation systems around the world. If you look at the ones, for example, in Iceland and New Zealand, you will find that they are based on the rule of law and property rights and transferable property rights. If we really want to solve the problem in the fisheries industry, it is time to trust the rule of law; it is time to trust property rights; it is time to trust the free market.</p>

I particularly think there is scientific evidence in place to allow this ban to be lifted. But, in any case, none of this discussion has come to the fore.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have instead is a very expensive process in Europe for cleaning chicken carcasses. That is the real problem because any carcasses that come into the European Union would seem to be cheaper; as a result they sell more quickly and obviously suit the consumers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Relations between the European Union and Russia are of enormous importance for stability, economic growth and security in Europe and the whole world. These relations took on a new dimension after the EU’s enlargement with another 12 countries, principally from central and eastern Europe. These are countries that, in the past, were closely linked economically, politically and militarily with the former Soviet Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thus far, bilateral trading relations with individual countries have been transferred to the level of the EU and Russia.

      <p sl="pt">The transport of dangerous goods has been discussed many times, and safety standards have gradually been clarified and simplified as a result. With Mr Liberadzki’s report, therefore, existing legislation on the transport of dangerous goods will form a sound basis for the scope of the directive in particular, which has been extended to inland waterways. I congratulate the negotiators on reaching an agreement that will make it possible to conclude this dossier at second reading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The extension of the directive to inland waterways will involve a two-year transitional adaptation period for Member States, which will be able to regulate or prohibit the transport of dangerous goods in their territory for reasons other than safety during transport.</p>

No rules have so far been drawn up on that, although there is legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by boat is badly needed, not just for safety reasons but also to regulate protection of the environment and public health at European level. Much of the transport of this kind is cross-border. Furthermore, European rules are also to the benefit of businesses, which at the moment have to comply with different national requirements in the various Member States. Inland waterways transport also emits less greenhouse gas. It is therefore very important to harmonise the requirements for the various forms of transport. It will then become more attractive to combine several modes, for instance with part of the journey being done by rail and the freight then continuing by boat. Not only is that efficient, it is above all sustainable. I therefore hope that transport firms will actually opt more often for a combination of different modes of transport.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I abstained from voting on the report by Mr Helmut Markov on road infrastructure safety management. The reason is that this report runs flagrantly counter to the principle of subsidiarity: ‘a larger entity should not exercise functions that can be carried out by a smaller one’. This principle should be maintained with all possible care. Unfortunately, even in this House, I have often witnessed this principle being breached. I hope that on this occasion we managed to safeguard the principle at least partially, but how much time was spent doing this! Our legislative work was not directed towards the creation of good law, but to amending a poor legislative proposal. I am not, however, under any illusion that this will be the last attack on the principle of subsidiarity. This is paradoxical really, as these attacks come from the same quarter as the loudest criticisms of Ireland, a country that, a few days ago, rejected the Lisbon Treaty. People are just not making the connection that the citizens of that country said ‘no’ precisely because it is well known that this principle is regularly breached by the European Union. In fact, it is just this example, that of Ireland, that should make us aware that we cannot just ignore subsidiarity, or sacrifice it to what are allegedly higher goals, such as road safety. Sooner or later, and probably sooner, this will come back to haunt us.</p>

In calling for the official aid ceiling to be raised to EUR 100 000 per vessel and not per undertaking, in calling for the immediate application of emergency and social support measures and, lastly, in demanding the reorganisation of European Fund expenditure for fisheries, MEPs have made it clear to fishers that they have heard their distress call.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council of European fisheries ministers will be discussing these proposals on 23 and 24 June 2008. The European Union has no option but to restore the confidence of fishers in order to plug the huge hole that has recently appeared.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to point out once again that there is no western company that is as closely linked with the state as Gazprom is with the Kremlin. At present we are faced with a cold political calculation. The domination of Gazprom in the energy sector will lead to another increase in energy prices in Europe. Russia will be able to force through even greater political concessions for supplies of gas and oil. We are already seeing the effects of high prices in the ever more frequent protests in Europe. We also have, fresh in our memories, the repeated closure of gas supplies to our eastern neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, I support the ‘eSafety’ initiative (www.esafetysupport.org) within which the European Commission, the public authorities, the industry and other stakeholders are all working together to try to speed up the development and introduction of ‘Intelligent Integrated Vehicle Safety Systems’. These systems use information and communication technologies with a view to increasing road safety and reducing the number of accidents on our roads. ‘eSafety’ is the first step in the ‘Intelligent Car’ initiative launched in 2006 by the European Commission. I believe that this is a path we should swiftly follow in order to promote the future growth of transport which will, in the Commission’s words, be ‘smarter, safer and cleaner’.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Our dependence on transport grows every day. All citizens have the right to safe and sustainable mobility. The current progress in information and communication technologies enables us to manufacture and buy vehicles that are smarter, safer and cleaner. Consumers must have access to information that will enable them to make informed choices in favour of intelligent cars and it is important for these cars to become affordable.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since the report by the rapporteur, Mrs Zita Gurmai, offers European citizens the opportunity to benefit from the potential road traffic safety in the near future, I voted in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Road accidents are caused both by human error and by poor vehicle condition. By introducing intelligent technologies, 16% of accidents can be prevented. Modern systems can reduce the number of road accident fatalities by as much as one third. The Galileo programme also represents a significant contribution in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As regards the full deployment of the pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system, the eCall system, the EU Member States have a large responsibility. The aim is to have a full-scale roll-out of eCall by 2010. Therefore, I would encourage the Member States that have not yet signed the eCall Memorandum of Understanding to do so now, in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Taking into account that, according to the statistics, there are 41 600 deaths on European roads every year, we need to launch a new era in the road sector. By saving any number of human lives we will be doing a lot for European citizens.</p>

She is also right to point out that, at present, many people cannot afford the new systems, so the need to bring down costs has to be a priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Electronic stability control technology, the use of portable or nomadic devices and work towards providing cleaner vehicles are all topics covered by the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Intelligent Car Initiative is a very valuable initiative. It is important to use modern technology as much as possible to make transport safer and more efficient. Estimates indicate that if all cars were fitted with electronic stability control (ESC) there could be as many as four thousand fewer fatalities in the EU each year. Another important safety feature, which has not yet been generally introduced, is the pan-European in-vehicle accident notification system known as eCall. Research indicates that its introduction throughout the European Union could reduce traffic fatalities by two and a half thousand each year. The final issue that should be considered is the large amount of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted by cars, comprising 12% of total CO2 emissions in the EU. I think that cars with the lowest CO2 emissions should be marketed using social campaigns. We should also introduce more restrictive regulations to reduce emissions of harmful gases by cars.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as I was saying, according to the Campaign for Human Rights, Peace and Democracy in Burma, on 12 March, the oldest Burmese political prisoner spent her 78th birthday in solitary confinement at Insein prison.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is U Win Tin, an eminent journalist and leader of the National League for Democracy. U Win Tin is the oldest prisoner of conscience in Burma. She has spent the last 19 years in prison, since July 1989.</p>
      <p sl="es">She was sentenced to three terms of 21 years imprisonment. We only know about her current situation because of the latest report on the conditions of Burmese prisoners by Yozo Yokota, Special United Nations Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Burma.</p>
      <p sl="es">U Win Tin has refused to renounce her political ideals in exchange for her freedom. She was taken into hospital for a second hernia operation in January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">She is one of Burma’s 1 873 political prisoners. Obviously, in this resolution, we also want to express our condemnation of the extension of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s house arrest.</p>
      <p sl="es">My group demands immediate measures to begin an urgent and necessary process of political and economic reform. First, release of all political prisoners. Second, the restoration of basic civil liberties and, obviously, a political dialogue between all parties.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, numerous resolutions have been passed by this House condemning Burma’s military junta for the severe breaches it has committed repeatedly against the human rights of the Burmese people. Yet these heartless generals take little notice of what we tell them. Instead, they continue their firm hold on power in a most disgustingly pompous and irritating manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even following the devastation of the recent cyclone, they not only hampered aid attempts from the free world but also took advantage of the misery of their citizens in their time of need by promoting their own image as apparent Samaritans and angels of good by gross exhibitionist appearances on the junta-controlled state media and by holding a referendum on the Constitution only days after the cyclone catastrophe struck.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those who oppose the junta are tortured, killed or put in detention. An example, of course, is the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the National League for Democracy to victory in elections held 18 years ago and has spent 12 years in detention – and recently the junta decided to further extend the period of her house arrest.</p>
      <p sl="en">I feel that the time has come for more severe measures to be taken against the monstrous junta in Burma. The most effective measure would be to exert pressure on China to stop supporting it. If China does not cooperate on this, then we must take action in relation to our trade relations with Beijing and with regard to the Chinese Olympic Games. This is probably the only way left to us to do something about freedom and democracy in Burma.</p>

Although there may be many reservations with regards to China, we know that that country, at a very difficult time, was able to accept international aid. Similarly, we saw the attitude of Burma to international aid, including aid from the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There used to be an American play called ‘Same Time, Next Year’. Our Parliament is a bit like that with Burma. Every year we meet and discuss the situation in Burma. To be honest, there is no real, significant change. I agree with the facts presented by the previous speakers. A situation where a woman, the leader of the opposition, has been held under house arrest for so many years is unheard of in the world. We should not get used to this situation. I hope that we can overcome the divisions in this Parliament and speak with one voice in defence of democracy in Burma.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the military junta in Burma is persisting in its attempts to isolate the country and its people from the rest of the world. In September 2007, after the Buddhist monks’ protests had been brutally crushed, a news embargo was imposed. Last month, international organisations were prevented from helping the victims of the cyclone. There was a lengthy delay before aid workers were able to reach the people in distress, and for some the aid came too late.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now other reports of an equally alarming nature are filtering out, such as the news of the arrests of cyclone victims who had sought help from UN offices. In addition, security forces shot dead or seriously wounded inmates who were trying to flee from a prison destroyed by Cyclone Nargis. The EU did not turn a blind eye. It imposed a trade embargo, although that has not yet had the desired impact. It threatened to apply tougher sanctions if the human rights situation did not improve. Yet the Burmese leaders have not moved an inch.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us not relax our demands. The country’s political prisoners must be released. The house arrest in which Aung San Suu Kyi has been living for decades must be lifted. The courageous commitment shown by that Nobel prize winner would be anathema to any dictator. The Burmese generals must ultimately be held to account for the way they have dealt with their own country’s citizens, many of whom are still missing. The dialogue with the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur and the assurance that he would be allowed to visit the country constitute a first step. The governments of the Member Countries of ASEAN should also use their influence to bring the junta to its senses. There is a need to increase pressure on China too, which is probably the only remaining supporter of Burma. If necessary, the Council and the EU Member States must tighten their sanctions. Commissioner, we are truly waiting for you to act – the people of Burma need our solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the military regime in Burma tries to give the impression that it is maintaining a good policy and important national values against a hostile outside world that is threatening those positive values. It demands unanimous support from the population in defending those values.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I wish that claim were true and that the people of Burma could be happy with the situation in the past 40 years, but what are the values that the regime is defending? Four characteristics come to mind. Firstly, privileges for a military caste; a closed armed group controls the administration and the economy. That group can enrich itself, while others stay poor. Secondly, the repression of national minorities, the groups in the country with a different language and culture who want self-government. Their territories were added to Burma in the British colonial period, but there they are relegated to the status of third-rate citizens. Thirdly, foreign revenue is earned with exports based on competition through extremely low wages or forced labour. Fourthly, the systematic refusal to consult with groups that want to change that situation, even though they once won the only free elections this regime dared to hold.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With the aid after the flood disaster, we realised how much the regime fears the possibility that foreigners will see at first hand how bad the situation is or that they will influence the population. Internal refugees have to return quickly to devastated villages that have not been rebuilt, purely in order to prevent contact between disaffected masses. Immediately after the disaster, priority was given to holding a referendum whose main purpose was to exclude the democratic opposition permanently from power by means of a false result. The imprisonment of people on political grounds is a means of survival for such a regime. The outside world must stand up for those prisoners and other opponents. China and India should do so, as well as Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, here in Strasbourg we have considered the situation in Burma on Thursday afternoons almost every month in recent times. We have before us two reports relating to the situation in Burma. The first was produced by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the second is a report from the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the human rights situation in Burma. These reports are unequivocal. They speak of the imprisonment of parliamentarians, assassinations, terrible conditions in prisons for political prisoners and a catastrophic situation for civilisation in that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Acting as the European Parliament, we must put pressure on the authorities in Burma. For the situation to change over the coming weeks and months, what is needed is concerted action by all democratic parliaments throughout the world, as well as the cooperation of countries such as India and China, to put pressure on the authorities in Burma, so that there may be a real improvement in this situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to speak of the fate of parliamentarians who today are imprisoned in Burma, both the members of parliament who were arrested in the autumn of 2007 and those who disappeared or died in unknown circumstances, when they were arrested, as well as those who were assassinated and who died in unexplained circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report by the United Nations rapporteur is clear. The immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi would be a start for talks with the authorities in Burma on democracy and improvements in the human rights situation in that country. Guaranteeing freedom for political prisoners and, first and foremost, providing medical assistance to those prisoners, is of fundamental importance and this we must force onto the authorities in Burma.</p>

The party under her leadership won the election in 1990 with 82% of the vote, but the generals ruling the country refused to respect the will of the nation and Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 years since then.</p>
      <p sl="lt">‘Use your liberty to promote ours’, as the Nobel Prize laureate once said. I have no doubt that the people of Burma would then overcome the power of the generals. There are no immortal dictators, but the spirit of freedom is timeless.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We have no right to remain impartial when confronted with barbaric inhuman behaviour. I would like to quote Martin Luther King, who said: ‘In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.’</p>

We are again calling on the government in that country to respect human rights and basic humanitarian standards for the treatment of prisoners. We point out the injustices, we make appeals, we make requests, we lament the situation, we impose sanctions and, once again, we condemn the regime in Burma. In turn, that regime displays an astonishing immunity to pressure from the international community, ignores the appeals, just does not do anything about them.

Of course I agree with Mrs Grabowska that pressure is necessary. These regimes can fall only when the internal situation becomes one where the regime loses the support of those on which its internal policies depend. For this reason, the whole diplomatic effort should go, on the one hand, towards supporting even a weak and barely visible opposition, and, on the other hand, another solution would be if international political organisations, if international pressure, were supported by force.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the problem of violations of human rights in Burma has been discussed on several occasions during the present term of the European Parliament. Unfortunately, the debates and the resolutions that were passed have not changed the political and social situation in that country, where, since 1962, the army has held to power in one of the most infamous political regimes in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the past 40 years thousands of people who have been persecuted and convicted for political activity have been imprisoned in this country, which has experienced disasters inflicted not only by the regime. The population of Burma is forced to work and even children are conscripted into the army. The Secretary General of the League for Democracy has spent thirteen of the last eighteen years as a political prisoner under house arrest and, recently, 1 900 people were arrested — and are living in conditions that breach human rights — for expressing the desire to have democracy in Burma, or even for asking for humanitarian aid, which was needed after the passage of the cyclone.</p>
      <p sl="de">The regime in Burma does not just persecute the opposition. In addition, it breached human rights by making it impossible to provide humanitarian aid following the cyclone and this has put the lives of its citizens at risk. It has also forced cyclone victims to leave temporary camps and to return to homes that were destroyed in the disaster. Appeals from the UN Secretary General and other organisations have resulted in more arrests and killings of its tormented citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course we support a resolution that contains not only our opposition to the persecution of the Nobel Laureate, but also the proposal to release other political prisoners and to carry out an investigation, under the auspices of the UN, into the allegations of killings of prisoners by the army during the recent disaster.</p>

The ruling military regime has not, however, taken any steps on the path towards democracy. The General Secretary of the National League for Democracy has spent the last 13 years under house arrest. The Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was also awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, has been imprisoned without trial, despite pressure from international organisations. 1 900 opposition activists are being held in jail in inhuman conditions in Burma. What is also worrying are the reports of the murders of 36 prisoners in a prison facility in Rangoon, and the wounding of a further 70, as a result of the panic caused by the cyclone that devastated Burma in May this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The ruling regime should immediately lift all restrictions on free speech and fundamental rights, including bans on peaceful political activity. Burma has a responsibility to provide aid to cyclone victims and to give free access to the affected regions to international humanitarian organisations.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite enormous interest in the situation in Burma from the entire world as well as from various international institutions and organisations, no internal changes have taken place in that country. Thousands of people are still imprisoned in awful conditions because they stood up for democracy or because they protested against the constitutional referendum, the results of which cannot be considered to be reliable. The military regime is becoming more aggressive as regards political prisoners. Hopes that the authorities in Burma would start discussions with the opposition and with international organisations are unlikely to be fulfilled. For this reason it is essential to impose effective sanctions and pressures on the regime there, with as many countries as possible taking part.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, barely eight days after the cyclone, the Burmese regime forced the country, their own country, to take part in a referendum. A referendum on a widely criticised and controversial draft constitution. The results? Ridiculous, as if taken directly from the old communist period: turnout – 99%; support for the new constitution – 93%. A model of implausibility, that is all that can be said of these results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that regimes such as the regime in Burma have to fall sooner or later and the European Union should help it fall.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is unfortunately not here today, so I shall – on her behalf – share with you a few remarks about the situation in Burma/Myanmar.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament’s motion for a resolution focuses on the political situation and in particular on the continued detention of political prisoners. Before commenting on this issue, I would like to inform you about the Commission’s activities in response to the cyclone which devastated the delta of the Ayeryawaddy River six weeks ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s response to the cyclone was quick and substantial: we have approved EUR 17 million in humanitarian aid, including EUR 5 million in food aid. We have also activated the civil protection mechanism – the cooperation with the EU Member States having joined the mechanism has worked very well. We cover water purification, boat transport, primary health care and other issues of importance in the post-disaster context.</p>
      <p sl="en">The humanitarian emergency is not over. So far, approximately half of the survivors reached, that is, one million, are still in desperate need. Accessing the disaster-hit areas and distribution of aid is not without difficulties. This has as much to do with the size of the disaster as with the bureaucracy. Our field workers in Myanmar report gradually better cooperation from authorities. Our own humanitarian activities continue with reasonable efficiency. We recognise that the international NGOs are in a more difficult situation, as regards access to the stricken areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the mean time, the ASEAN countries have taken the lead in coordinating external assistance. They are a member of the so-called ‘Tripartite Mechanism’, which comprises the ASEAN countries, the Government of Burma/Myanmar, and the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Government has issued new ‘guidelines’ for external aid. We have no evidence yet whether they are being used to narrow the space for aid delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">For us, the cyclone and its terrible consequences are a purely humanitarian issue. We defend the concept of ‘needs-based’ humanitarian relief.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the political situation in Burma/Myanmar, the Government seems committed to proceed with its so-called ‘Road Map to Democracy’. We read this road map as a tightly controlled, slow transition towards a civilian government where the military still plays a dominant role. The Government seems committed to deliver, at its own pace and without regard to views and comments from outside. Realistically, there is hardly an alternative.</p>
      <p sl="en">National reconciliation would require an inclusive dialogue. Such dialogue cannot take place with political stakeholders in jail or under house arrest. This is why we continue to push for the release of all political prisoners. My colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, has said publicly that the Government has missed a chance to send a signal of reconciliation at a moment of national distress when the Government again extended the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people of Burma/Myanmar would deserve a system of government which focuses on economic and social development, and on the participation of the electorate in the political process. For Europe, expressing our indignation and isolating the country is clearly not an adequate response. The people of Burma/Myanmar shall not pay the price of a political stalemate. They deserve better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I wish to highlight our commitment to follow closely the situation in Burma/Myanmar. This includes continuing to push for a release of all political prisoners, and for an inclusive dialogue, including legal political parties and ethnic groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">We continue a balanced approach. We are not up to confrontation for the sake of confrontation. Our ultimate goal remains to help a peaceful transition to a legitimate, civilian government. This is why we are fully supportive of the good offices of the UN Secretary General and his Special Advisor for Myanmar.</p>
      <p sl="en">The interest of the Burmese people is best served with a balanced policy, including substantial assistance. The Commission has carefully chosen the areas of assistance to help the most vulnerable class of society. We have already significantly increased funding and hope that – in a coordinated effort with other donors – the overall funding level could reach the equivalent of what is spent per capita in comparable countries, like Laos and Cambodia. The people of Myanmar deserve a better future.</p>

      <p sl="es">From this same seat, I asked the European Union to adopt a Community policy of coordination and mutual assistance that would allow military vessels in international waters and flying the flag of a Member State to protect merchant and fishing boats flying the flag of other Member States at the first possible opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, I would like to denounce categorically the trade in weapons and ammunition with organised bands and paramilitary factions. My group would like to ask the competent international organisations and appropriate regional organisations to recommend adequate preventive measures to stop weapons reaching such groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">My group would like to ask donor countries and the European Union to respect their commitments and guarantee close coordination to increase the effectiveness of development aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would also like to ask the Commission, represented here today, to propose a rapid, considerable increase in European Union financial resources for Somalia, particularly on the occasion of the intermediate review of the 10th European Development Fund, and also an increase in its physical presence in that country. I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask what it is doing or plans to do in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Somalia is a country stricken by civil war and poverty over a number of years now. Thousands of civilians have died as a result, and hundreds of thousands have suffered and are still suffering.</p>
      <p sl="en">The international community has taken some action and, it has to be said, with some limited success. But the plight of the Somali people continues, and the killing of civilians in that region, unfortunately, has now become a routine matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bold and effective additional action is necessary, mainly – in my view – as follows:</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the UN arms embargo on Somalia must be strictly enforced. This must include China, which is the usual culprit in such situations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it must be ensured that all UN and EU aid going to Somalia reaches those in real and legitimate need and does not enter the pockets of war lords.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, pressure must be exerted on the UN Security Council to proceed urgently with the implementation of its unanimous decision of 15 May 2008 to deploy a sufficiently strong UN peacekeeping force in the region – making sure, of course, that such peace-keepers are not of the same quality as those who recently were accused of committing crimes against the local population they were supposed to protect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the African Union must, once again, be made to understand that it bears primary responsibility for what is happening in African regions such as Somalia, and – instead of much ineffective rhetoric – it must take urgent and practical action against all those regimes or other parties or factions that are throwing African people deeper into primitive and desperately dramatic situations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in 1960, British and Italian Somaliland looked forward to their dream of independence. But that dream very soon turned sour and I remember as chairman in the British Parliament of the British Somali Group, having this string of refugees coming to tell us first about the authoritarian regime in that country and then, of course, about the factional fighting and the anarchy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Somaliland still has a degree of independence and stability, as does Puntland. But Mogadishu is a name synonymous with violence, murder, riots, hunger and a failed economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what do we do? Well, we cannot do that much. Certainly not individually; probably not as Europe. But we can work with other international players to put pressure on the players inside the country to agree to halt the ongoing conflict, to halt violence, to stop the violations of international human rights and to work towards peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have got to persuade them to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need, and we have, perhaps, to help them ensure the safety of those humanitarian aid workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must appeal to those outside who can help. We appeal to Kenya to allow Somali refugees to have access to the El Wak border and the right to assistance in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We appeal to everyone, as has been referred to already, to ensure that we have the embargo on the sale of arms to that country. We insist that those who have committed war crimes must be brought to justice and, where appropriate, to the International Criminal Court. And, of course, we welcome the UN Security Council’s resolution of May calling for the deployment of 28 000 troops as a peacekeeping force; more realistically, perhaps, we urge that AMISOM be mandated to take protective action.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the violence in Somalia has everything to do with the fact that since 1991 there has no longer been a generally recognised government there. In the south and centre of the country there has been fighting between the militias of various warlords for years and in the north the administration of the territory of the former British colony of Somaliland that is operating there is not recognised internationally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then a conflict broke out between the Union of Islamic Courts and the army of neighbouring Ethiopia. Talks about reunification of the country never received general support and those who did support them often stopped.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The years of chaos soon turn support from the rest of the world for any transitional government into interference in insoluble armed domestic conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the past few years I have warned a number of times that, by helping to finance failing structures, the European Union is being tied to one of the warring parties without any prospect of a lasting and widespread solution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe certainly has to help if a solution is possible, but over-hasty interference leads to disaster.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In a previous urgent debate on Somalia on 15 November 2007, this Parliament adopted a resolution calling for an end to foreign military intervention and for dialogue and reconciliation within the country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is to be welcomed that the resolution that has now been tabled speaks out against European Union support for warlords who are trying to re-establish their power, against the use of child soldiers and against further arms supplies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yesterday there was an unsuccessful attempt to murder the Transitional President, Abdullahi Yusuf. Armed troops are still in sharp conflict with each other. We now have to see whether the agreement reached last week to end the violence within 30 days and to replace the Ethiopian intervention force with a United Nations peacekeeping force has a real chance of success. If that leads to real solutions, it will make sense for Europe to support it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the recent resumption of fighting in Somalia between units of the Transitional Federal Government and insurgents has claimed the lives of more than a hundred people and has led to the mass exodus of the civilian population from the Somali capital Mogadishu. Violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence in Somalia by all sides in the conflict, with torture, rape, murder and attacks on civilians.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The international community cannot remain indifferent towards these glaring acts of violence in Somalia. The European Union must decisively increase its involvement in order to resolve the conflict in Somalia and should call on the parties to the conflict to take all possible steps to provide humanitarian organisations with unimpeded access to victims in that country so that they can bring them aid. Bringing in UN peacekeepers until the political situation improves would also be a step in the right direction, as would renewing UN embargoes on the supply of arms to Somalia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The research found that Somalia was the second most dangerous country in the world, after Iraq. The reality is depressing. No progress is visible in the resolution of this long-running conflict and the information that is coming out is horrifying. I will not describe it all here, but will say just that, as far as Somali pirates are concerned, they have hijacked 26 ships so far since the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In a conflict that is as hopeless as the one in Somalia, any agreement between the parties should be given due attention. Let us hope that the agreement of 9 June in Djibouti will prove to be a breakthrough in this conflict and will lead to lasting peace.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Somalia has seen brutal fighting for many years. In the last few days it is estimated that about one hundred people have been killed and about two hundred wounded. Thousands of people had to abandon their homes in Mogadishu. Attacks on civilians and the media are increasing. On 7 June Nasteh Dahir Farah, vice-president of the National Union of Somali Journalists, was brutally murdered. Workers from aid organisations have also been murdered, among them Mohamed Mahdi. There is growing recruitment of children into army units. 2.6 million Somalis (about 35% of the population) require humanitarian aid. In its reports, Amnesty International has described some of the extreme forms of attacks on unarmed civilians. Attackers frequently just cut the throats of women and teenagers.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am grateful to Mr Dess and others for the food aid and medical aid that are being dispensed there, but now we must also target a political solution that has not been in place since 1991. The only option, in my view, is for the UN force to be deployed, but it must be supplemented by appropriate civilian structures. As far as the Transitional Federal Government is concerned, we have to ask where the transition is leading. It is either a transition to a viable autonomous structure, or else it is necessary to establish an international civilian structure, as has happened in other countries. If we do not get this right, we shall ultimately have the entire nation dependent on humanitarian aid. That cannot be the way to eradicate murders, rapes and famine.</p>

      <p sl="en">We could be in danger of a return to the scenes of the 1992 famine if the international community does not give Somalia greater priority. 2.6 million people out of a population of around 8.6 million urgently need assistance. If there is no significant improvement in this country, this figure could rise to 3.5 million by the end of 2008. 1.1 million people are now internally displaced. Since January alone, over 300 000 people have fled their homes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Humanitarian organisations are severely hampered in their efforts to help Somali civilians and are experiencing attacks, theft and obstruction at checkpoints. Such personnel face significant risks on a daily basis in their attempts to deliver food to those most in need.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unfortunately my colleague Louis Michel is not here today, so on his behalf I wish to share with you some remarks about this issue in Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would like to share your concern about the continuing conflict and political instability in Somalia. Somalia remains a context where fundamental rights and respect for basic human dignity continue to be shunned by armed entities perpetrating systematic and widespread attacks against civilians. Seventeen years of statelessness have seen loss of civilian life, mass displacements and destruction of physical infrastructures. One third of the population, corresponding to 2.6 million people, depends on humanitarian aid today. The European Union, together with other key international actors, is committed to helping at this critical juncture.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the political level, the EU will continue to provide its full support to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General in his efforts to coordinate the action of the international community and to facilitate inter-Somali political dialogue. We are now examining – together with other donors – the appropriate ways and means to better assist Somalis to effectively implement the Djibouti Agreement reached on 9 June. This agreement offers fresh hope for long-term peace and stability to the people of Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="en">At humanitarian level, the EU is mainly focusing on supporting basic sectors such as health, nutrition, food assistance, shelter and non-food relief items, water and sanitation, as part of a range of activities particularly targeting central and southern areas of the country that have been badly affected by civilian strife and extreme natural hazards.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2007 our Humanitarian Aid Department managed to provide EUR 18 million in humanitarian assistance. In response to the worsening humanitarian situation and to the increase in food prices, the level of assistance should reach a total of EUR 27 million for this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the development level, the EU is already the main aid donor for Somalia, providing medium- to long-term support for establishing a peaceful and self-sustainable society.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU Country Strategy for Somalia allocates more than EUR 212 million for the period 2008-2013, under the 10th European Development Fund. One third of this programme will be spent on education, which is relevant to respect for human rights. The critical goal is to encourage reconciliation, democracy and the development of governance structures at all levels. However, without peace and security it is not possible to engage effectively in longer-term development. Priority is therefore given to promoting a peaceful and secure environment in which human rights are respected and democratic processes and institutions can develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Michel met with the Somali President, just a few days ago, on the margin of the IGAD Summit in Addis Ababa. On that occasion, President Yusuf made a strong appeal for international assistance to support a better, secure environment for people living in Somalia. We gave a commitment to provide strong support for the Somali Government to this end. The European Commission is already financing the training of Somali police forces through the UN, and funds are also being contributed to the costs of the AMISOM operation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ultimately the political process of reconciliation and stabilisation will also depend on the engagement and support of key regional players, namely Ethiopia and Eritrea, which have used the Somali theatre for a ‘proxy war’. In this respect the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Somalia is a key element for any political breakthrough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Michel, who met Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia and President Isaias of Eritrea last weekend, urged them to support the Djibouti process, which, although far from being perfect, offered a real if not the only opportunity to bring together the different Somali actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the difficult circumstances, the Commission will continue its programme of aid to Somalia, which has been designed with Member States, in order to alleviate the suffering of the Somali population and to establish the ground for a peaceful society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some questions were raised about piracy and I would add that, although it is not competent for the deployment of naval forces as foreseen by UNSC Resolution 1816, the Commission has set up, together with the Council, a working group composed of the relevant directorates-general – namely the Energy and Transport DG, the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG, the Development DG and EuropeAid – to study the best way to implement the UN resolution.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the human rights situation in Iran has deteriorated dramatically since 2005.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Iranian judiciary has the sad record of imposing the second highest number of executions per capita in the world. Only China carries out more executions than Iran.</p>
      <p sl="es">As mentioned in the resolution, two important agreements, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ban the death penalty as punishment for crimes committed when the perpetrator is under 18. The most serious aspect is that Teheran has ratified both agreements. Although ratification is positive, the country does not respect these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and drugs trafficking are punishable by death in Iran. Most of the children were sentenced for murder, but many sentences seem to be based on unreliable confessions, obtained by torture and during interrogations at which the detained were denied the right of access to a lawyer.</p>
      <p sl="es">The courts routinely ignore evidence presented by defendants showing that the accused acted in self-defence.</p>
      <p sl="es">The execution of children in Iran will be one of the issues included in the report to the General Assembly by the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore ask Iran to stop these executions once and for all, including those of at least 85 people who are sentenced to death for crimes committed when they were children.</p>
      <p sl="es">I did not want to finish without saying I consider that, this week, Parliament and the European Union have lost a certain moral credibility to defend the rights of children, when yesterday this Chamber approved a shameful directive that allows the imprisonment of children for committing the crime of coming to Europe without papers.</p>

Resistance in Iran is extremely difficult and fraught with the risk of death. Outside the country Iranian civilians are struggling to fight for a democratic change in their country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such people include those belonging to the entirely non-violent PMOI organisation. Yet the Commission had put this organisation on the terrorist list and until recently was refusing to correct this mistake, even after relevant EU court rulings. I ask the Commissioner: why was this Iranian resistance organisation put on the terrorist list in the first place?

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when we are discussing issues of breaches of human rights in the world, we have to make certain distinctions, particularly between situations where we are considering unstable regimes, civil wars, crimes committed in situations of absolute chaos and situations like the one in Iran, where the state is relatively stable, where there is no civil war, where there are elections from time to time, but where the state uses criminal methods such as executions of children. This is a completely different situation from the issues we have been discussing, like the matters debated today with regard to Somalia or Burma. In these situations it is not an issue of some internal disorder, it is an issue of a different civilisation. It reminds us of Huntington’s book ‘The Clash of Civilisations’, or of the books of the great historian and philosopher Feliks Koneczny, who spoke of fundamental differences in civilisations. If we wish to resolve these problems, then we must think how we can influence these regimes to change their mentality.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Stop killing children – that is the most important thing, the position the European Parliament is making clear in its resolution. This is our message to the new Majlis of Iran, who should understand their duty – to reform the Iranian penal code without delay to bring it into line with the international obligations undertaken by this country and the international rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In my opinion, executions of underage children or those who committed crimes while underage are totally unacceptable. The fact that the policy pursued by the Iranian Government is in conflict with international law was recently highlighted by the UN High Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The European Parliament has more than once expressed its firm belief and position: it is against the death penalty and in favour of a worldwide death-penalty moratorium. We are talking about men, women, children, teenagers and minorities here, so I would like to finish by calling on the Iranian Government to prevent the execution of those teenagers who have already received the death penalty, as it is inhumane.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I do not share the view of the Bush Administration that Iran represents a threat to world safety and therefore it is necessary to have an arms race. I am also against forcing our values and our lifestyle on different cultures for one reason alone, namely opening the door to supra-national capital leading to the sources of raw materials on this planet and so to latter-day colonialism. However, I opposed the barbaric acts that are still being carried out although the reasons for doing so have long gone. Moreover, there is no justification in Iranian culture for the barbaric acts of executions of juvenile offenders and even political opponents committed by the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s Iranian regime. In the past, this country used to carry out the death penalty only in exceptional cases and public executions took place only as a punishment for mass murders or child murders. Under the current Iranian Government, however, hundreds of executions take place each year, and many of them involve juveniles, such as 17-year old Mohammad Hassanzadeh, who was executed on 10 June. Recently I saw photographs of public executions in Iran. Believe me, they are among the worst things I have seen in my life.</p>
      <p sl="cs">My Group, the GUE/NGL Group, is using the European Parliament to call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease executions with immediate effect, especially the executions of people who committed a criminal offence when they were juveniles. Under Mr Ahmadinejad, Iran has long been sending not just mass murderers to the gallows but also people who have committed acts that in developed countries receive much lighter punishments or are not even considered to be against the law. The country must review its understanding of the law and modify it to ensure that human life is respected. Until this happens, Iran will stay on the margins of the civilised world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the systematic violation of human rights in Iran brings us together here once again. The fundamental issue is the execution of juveniles for alleged crimes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Can I please clarify that it is often a case of relations between juveniles of the same sex, for example, which are not even a crime, and which lead to death sentences and public executions, as has already been seen in films recording the barbarity of the regime.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This barbarity is not confined to juveniles, however, and is not confined to execution by stoning, to the records of the execution. It also involves the external dimension of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must therefore ask the European institutions once again why they continue to encourage the terrorist regime in Tehran to classify the opposition Iranian People’s Mujahedin as terrorists, as our fellow member Mr Matsakis has stressed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Why is it that instead of condemning terrorism and human rights violations, they use economic and trade packages to encourage Tehran to condemn the victims of terrorism? This is completely immoral and indefensible and is a policy that will inevitably lead us to a confrontation, to war, if we do not challenge it quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">And for these reasons I would like to call upon the Commission and the Council to change their policy and to comply with the courts, and not to reward terrorism in this way.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I can understand, although I absolutely do not accept it, that there are legal systems in the world that use the death penalty. However, I cannot imagine how even the supporters of the death penalty, particularly in our cultural circles, can entertain the possibility of imposing this penalty, and then carrying it out, on children and teenagers. But this is exactly the situation in Iran. According to the latest report from Amnesty International more than one hundred teenagers are currently waiting to be executed, and this number does not include everyone, as some of the sentences do not get recorded.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is right that we should call on the political and judicial authorities in Iran to introduce a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty. However, we must also ask ourselves how the international community should be judged, how we ourselves should be judged, since we are unable to ensure that signatories to international agreements comply with the clauses contained in those agreements, at the expense of teenagers who are sentenced to death. There is just one subtext, which is the economic subtext and this, unfortunately, outweigh humanitarian considerations.</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, the world does not tolerate the death penalty, but Iran is taking its own course. The situation in that country is grim. The Iranian authorities are not selective about who is to be executed; the death penalty is applied even to young people.</p>
      <p sl="et">As a country which has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is running into sharp conflict with the world. The application of the death penalty is in complete contravention of human rights. Such a mode of punishment is inhuman. The execution of at least thirty minors in Iran up to the present is supremely unjust.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to hope that the eighty-five minors currently awaiting the death penalty will be saved by the world – including us – from their cruel fate.</p>
      <p sl="et">Let us hope that the newly elected parliament will usher in new winds of humanity. Mediaeval methods of execution should be consigned to history. Legislation should be introduced in Iran that is consistent with international law. It is high time that Iran moved into the 21st century. I fully support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are debating this matter today because we have been moved by the threat to carry out the death penalty on four young people under 18 years of age. This is not the first such decision from the Iranian justice system. Fortunately Iran is one of just a few countries that sentence teenagers to death and, what is worse, actually carry out these sentences. In addition, over the past three years, Iranian sentences have constituted over two thirds of all sentences of this type in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is outrageous that Iran should breach international conventions, to which it is a signatory, and which categorically prohibit such measures, in such a blatant manner. This raises a question of a much more general nature: does the international community have any mechanisms and instruments to deal with such countries? In other words, is it possible for breaches of undertakings made voluntarily by a given country to result in some tangible and meaningful sanctions?</p>
      <p sl="pl">This brings two things to mind. The first is the need to reconsider the much-used concept of rule of law. Convictions of teenagers for homosexual behaviour may be in accordance with the law in force in Iran, but we cannot, of course, agree with rule of law understood in this way.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second issue is that if we demand that others should comply with their undertakings as well as with reasonable laws that comply with basic freedoms, then we should respect these laws ourselves. In this context we cannot but remember our own dilatoriness, not to use any stronger words, when it comes to fulfilling the final court judgment and removing the Iranian mujahedin from the list of terrorist organisations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the most treasured possession that any person has is their life. Therefore, no one should deprive them of that possession for any reason. What is particularly outrageous is the use of beatings and torture on young people to force them to make confessions that are needed to justify death sentences. Iran is certainly one of the countries where many death sentences are carried out, including on young people. Recent information indicates that at least 85 underage criminals are awaiting execution in that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is therefore high time that Iran should stop carrying out these procedures and should adopt the legal standards accepted by other countries. Young people should be educated, not killed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in Iran at least 430 death penalties have been carried out on young people since 1990. The death penalty for children is a dishonour for adults. Every crime perpetrated by a teenager is the result of an educational failure by adults. Transferring the responsibility for one’s own failings or incompetence onto a teenager, carrying out inhumane sentences, including the death penalty, on children, that truly is a crime. In Iran the death penalty is even carried out on ten year olds. Death penalties for teenagers are contrary to the international obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian authorities should immediately stop murdering young people in the name of an inhumane law.</p>

In fact, a century has passed, or perhaps one and a half centuries, and the same thing is happening in Iran, an Islamic country, where, from one side, it can be seen that attention is paid to the family. What is happening there is a barbarism more extreme than one’s worse imaginings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we do not act to defend these children, if we do not boycott the regime, if we do not condemn it as much as possible throughout the world, then we shall be judged to have been complicit, that we kept quiet and did not try to defend human life.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner is unfortunately not here today, so on her behalf I thank you for the opportunity to address the issue of juvenile executions in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares your deep concern about this harrowing question. While, as you know, the Commission lacks a representation in Tehran, it follows the human rights situation very closely and acts in close concertation with the EU Member States’ embassies represented there. It is important to note that the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission have taken a coherent and consistent line. The seriousness of our concerns has been clearly stated through the three statements published by the EU Presidency over the past two weeks: on 4 and 10 June, over the cases of Mr Fadaei, Mr Shojaee and Mr Jazee, all facing imminent executions for crimes committed when they were minors; and on 13 June, on the execution of Mohammad Hassanzadeh.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully supports the principle and the content of these statements: there can be no justification for the use of the death penalty by the Iranian authorities in the case of juvenile offenders. This explicitly runs counter to the legally binding provisions of international law, which Iran has ratified, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that we have had to issue so many statements at such a rapid pace obviously reflects the growing number of executions in Iran, including of minors. The moratorium decreed by Iran’s Chief Judiciary, Ayatollah Shahroudi, on youth executions is blatantly violated by his own judges.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, unfortunately, the tone and the frequency of our statements on Iran also reflect the fact that our dialogue and démarches on human rights in general and on the issue of juvenile executions in particular have not been effective. The Iranian authorities increasingly turn a deaf ear to our calls for compliance with international human rights law and we have therefore no choice but to resort to the so-called ‘megaphone diplomacy’ via public statements that Tehran claims to abhor and reject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran must face up to its own responsibilities. For its part, following the execution of Mr Hassanzadeh, the Commission has explicitly told the Iranian authorities that such an act could only cast a shadow over’s Iran’s international reputation and our relationship. Without a concrete improvement of the human rights situation, our common objective of developing substantively the relationship between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran is hindered.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust that the European Parliament and all EU partners will agree to this line and act accordingly. Therefore, I solemnly reiterate our call to the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by the international conventions to which it is party and spare the life of all minors still on death row.</p>
