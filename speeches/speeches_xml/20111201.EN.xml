      <p sl="en">Madam President, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, I would like to congratulate the European Parliament for its resolution on the EU response to HIV/AIDS which you will adopt later today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully shares your concern and your commitment to improving the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond. The resolution is a strong and timely political signal underlining that, 30 years into the epidemic, HIV/AIDS still needs urgent attention. Last year alone, 25 000 people got infected in the EU and more than 100 000 new cases were reported in the Eastern Neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to working towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care to support achieving the Millennium Development Goals targets by 2015. Let me reassure you that fighting HIV/AIDS remains high on the Commission’s agenda, following the adoption two years ago of our strategy and action plan on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, the Commission has supported a number of initiatives in this field to help Member States and stakeholders across Europe through the Health Programme, the development programmes and bilateral agreements with third countries. Indeed, evidence-based prevention, access to testing, treatment and care, and fighting discrimination are the core elements of our response to HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also fostered mechanisms to coordinate HIV/AIDS policies and actions, such as the HIV/AIDS Think-Tank and the Civil Society Forum. Two years on, the overall Strategy and Action Plan to combat HIV/AIDS remains valid, and the Commission will report on its implementation early next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Especially in times of economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of HIV/AIDS. The Commission will continue to play its full and active role now and in the future. I take this opportunity to stress that HIV features prominently in the Commission proposal for a new Health Programme which Parliament will be debating soon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, today is World Aids Day. Our Parliament felt that it was very important that we adopt this resolution in order to send a strong message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the AIDS epidemic is on the decline worldwide and is probably far less visible, we must not let our guard down: it remains a blight today. It affects over 12 million young people aged 15 to 25, including 500 000 in Europe, and so we need to rally all our political forces.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Dalli has just said, the European Commission adopted an action plan to combat HIV/AIDS for the period 2009-2013. A mid-term review is important because it will allow us to take stock and identify exactly what progress has been made. The reality is that over 50 000 new cases of HIV are diagnosed every year in the European Union and neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the Union, almost 30% of those who are HIV-positive do not know that they are infected – the figure is as high as 70% in several neighbouring countries. Consequently, this is a serious problem for political decision makers, which means us. Half of HIV-positive patients are still treated late, reaching advanced stages of infection before being diagnosed and starting treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, recent findings show that the risk of transmitting the virus to uninfected partners can be reduced by 96% if patients take retroviral drugs from the moment when HIV is diagnosed, rather than when their health begins to decline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, it is imperative that the European Union maintain its commitment so as to avoid negating the progress and investments made thus far. We need to beef up prevention and training. We need to improve surveillance. We need to work tirelessly to create networks linking all the stakeholders working to combat this curse. We must also promote the dissemination of good practices and, among other things, make sure that simple yet effective tests are available for our citizens. If these tests become widely available, I think that it will be much easier for everyone to find out whether they are carrying the virus.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the challenge facing us. I feel that it is imperative that we remain vigilant and continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, World AIDS Day 2011 marks 30 years of the discovery of the first AIDS case in 1981. It is an opportunity for us to unite in the fight against HIV, to show our support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate those who have died. HIV/AIDS remains of major public health importance in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I am calling for the EU to implement the strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries. We need stronger action to reduce new infections, over 25 000 of which were recorded in 2009. An estimated 30% of people with HIV/AIDS are unaware they carry the virus. Therefore, we need to increase HIV testing amongst most-at-risk populations, such as young people, homosexual men, injecting drug users, sex workers and prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Between 2007 and 2010, a new HIV testing programme in the US was carried out aimed at hard-to-reach groups and high-risk populations. Testing took place in a range of settings: emergency departments, STI clinics, substance abuse clinics and community-based organisations. Whilst most testing was carried out in clinical settings, conducted by community-based organisations as part of the programme, it yielded a disproportionate number of new diagnoses, indicating the importance of supporting community-based organisations to improve rates of HIV diagnosis. We must guarantee access to HIV prevention, counselling, testing and early care, and, most of all, support a community-based approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also calling for more action to tackle stigma and discrimination. People living with HIV/AIDS should be included in all equality and anti-discriminatory legislation. A 2010 UNAIDS survey reported that those living with HIV experienced high levels of negative attitudes and behaviours, as well as employment discrimination, including loss of work. Exclusion from family activities was reported by more than 40% of respondents. We must remember that the enemy is HIV, not HIV carriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should also provide a policy framework to encourage national governments to address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the context of sexual health strategies. We need adequate information and sex education, access to protection means, such as male and female condoms, and strengthening the rights of women in sexual relationships. In an Irish context, I regret we still have not developed a national sexual health strategy. Of course, the active participation and involvement of people living with HIV at all levels of the national and international response is crucial to the success of all our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I wish to thank my fellow co-sponsors on this question, and especially my colleague, Michael Cashman, who has worked so hard on this issue for so long.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="34234" name="Antonyia Parvanova" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, almost three years after the launch of the EU strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries, we must admit that, even within the European Union, we are far from reaching the objective of this year’s World AIDS Day of ‘Getting to Zero’, which refers to zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.</p>
      <p sl="de">Progress still needs to be made, whether in prevention, early diagnosis or timely access to treatment. The situation within our Union is even more worrying in certain regions, notably Eastern Europe, while at the same time, the disease tends to be forgotten in the minds of people and policy makers. Thirty years after the first detection of AIDS, it is still crucial to underline the importance of greater awareness-raising and information, the need for strengthened and targeted prevention policies and the need for governments in the EU to remain committed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, we welcome the Commission’s commitment and continuous effort in implementing its strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, but we hope that you will make clear to Member States that having a strategy just on paper is not enough. Even during a time of crisis, national AIDS programmes need to be effectively financed and implemented. Let us also look at the reality and focus on the right priorities. There is no room for taboo or forbidden topics. It is crucial that Member States ensure that all national AIDS programmes and strategies develop strong linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, let me say a word about the resolution that we will be voting on today and which has been broadly supported by all groups within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Yes, there are vulnerable groups that are more at risk, notably young people, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users, which deserve all our attention and for which targeted strategies should be developed and reinforced. These groups become more vulnerable when subjected to social exclusion, stigmatisation and discrimination, from which people living with HIV are too often suffering. It is certainly not by denying the existence of these groups or by refusing to speak about anti-discrimination campaigns that we will succeed in our continuous fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore hope that all Members of this House will abstain from ideological consideration and will support the resolution as a whole. Today is World AIDS Day, an occasion to recall and maintain our consistent and unambiguous commitment in combating HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease?</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012-000" speaker_id="34234" name="Antonyia Parvanova" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree absolutely with Mrs Roth-Behrendt. It is crucial that we use all the available means and political tools to implement our strategy, but also that we make it a reality and make it work.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to use the opportunities presented by e-health, innovation and partnership, ICT enhancement, and health technology and assessment. All this together will help us actually deliver because – as I said at the beginning – we have failed. It is crucially important to have transparency on the flows of money dedicated to certain priorities and to see what the added value is of that money, those priorities and this decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in this House have been aware of all the lobbying for different priorities which are not important for society or for European citizens, but which are important for certain groups of lobbyists. So let us now do something on behalf of, and to the benefit of, our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we remember with great sadness the many thousands of innocent lives claimed by this terrible wasteful disease. Shocking statistics show that there is still no decrease in the number of new infections within the EU. That is not good enough. HIV is an epidemic that affects all Member States and we have a great responsibility to those living with HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="en">Later today, I hope that Parliament will adopt the resolution on the EU’s global response to HIV and AIDS. The resolution looks at all aspects of the EU’s contribution to fighting HIV and AIDS, including funding for research to find a vaccine. We need to deal with a disease which knows no borders, no race, no age and no gender. However, this is a disease we can control, especially through testing, and I am confident that one day we will find a cure. For now, we have to raise public awareness in this battle, support civil groups in their work and continue sharing research. I am happy to say this resolution goes a long way towards these aims.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECR Group joins with all those across the globe in memory of friends, relatives and loved ones who have died as a result of contracting AIDS. We stand fully behind the drive to beat HIV and AIDS and to improve the lives of all those who live with it, and we reaffirm our commitment to this fight.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to all those involved in drafting this resolution. Our common objective is to reduce the number of HIV infections, for statistics do not support the notion that this is what is happening.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the EU countries, tens of thousands of new cases are confirmed every year, and if we include our neighbouring countries, the number of new cases a year is in excess of 100 000. However, this is a disease that is completely preventable, and we know how to do this. The main reason why everything that can be done to prevent new HIV infections is not being done is hypocrisy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A few years ago, I was in South Africa and I happened to see a television advertisement in which Nelson Mandela said that we speak to our children about sex because we love them. Mandela was obviously referring to the fact that young people and people in general could protect themselves from HIV. They need to know about sex and they need to know, for example, that a condom will protect them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The experience of my own country, Finland, is that sex education in schools and the open debate generally on sex, together with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, are an effective way to reduce the number of problems relating to sexual behaviour, from abortions to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. That is why sexual and reproductive health services are so vitally important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Many Members have already referred to the position of women. Statistics show that 45% of those newly infected are young women under the age of 25. This clearly shows that the issue also concerns gender roles and whether women have the knowledge and courage to insist on the use of a condom in their sexual relations. Testing obviously plays a crucial part in the prevention of new infections, because people who are not aware that they are infected are three times more likely to spread the disease. Similarly, treatment is crucially important, for example, in preventing the infection from being passed on from breastfeeding or expectant mothers to their children, and the prevention of discrimination is important from the perspective of treatment, as some Members have already mentioned. I hope that we can add to our general objectives and set concrete goals, as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has done.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we are here today, all united around a resolution that makes a series of demands that are very important in terms of intervention. We are talking about World AIDS/HIV Day, and this evaluation of the resolution and communication of 2009 is crucial. It is crucial precisely because of things that have already been mentioned. We are repeating ourselves because, unfortunately, there is still room for repetition, which means a lot remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are many new cases diagnosed every year in Europe and in the European Economic Area: the 2010 report talks about more than 25 000 new cases. If we take into account neighbouring countries, we are talking about over 100 000 new cases. Moreover, if we think that some things are as bad as they can be, they can always get worse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One of the issues that I would like to make very clear here has to do with the divestment that has been taking place in the health care sector because of the economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing. This divestment has been having a very serious effect on areas crucial to combating HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Commissioner, I think that the Commission has a key role here in calling on the Member States to meet their obligations in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A second issue has to do with the increased discrimination that the economic and social crisis has also brought to light; discrimination against workers who have lost their jobs because they are carriers of this virus. That is why prevention, treatment and care should be the same for everyone, regardless of sex or age, and regardless of the region in which they live. I hope we will be able to implement these measures with your support, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the EU response to HIV infection, which we have played an active part in drafting and signed, calls attention to the extraordinarily high number of infections affecting European citizens each year. In particular, it draws attention to the fact that 30% of HIV-positive people are co-infected with hepatitis C.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must implement policies informing of the risks that people run in becoming infected with a disease, which, in addition to being debilitating, often causes the death of sufferers. Unfortunately, owing to an amendment passed by a majority in committee, the original text has been changed to include a sentence on abortion with which we do not agree, as it has nothing to do with the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have specifically requested a separate vote on the change introduced by the amendment on abortion in order to delete it, in the hope that the original text, which we support, is upheld. Should this not be the case, whilst we believe that this resolution is important for European citizens and for young people in particular, we will be unable to vote in favour and will have to abstain.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017-000" speaker_id="96951" name="Diane Dodds" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the number of people living with HIV in the United Kingdom has hit an estimated 91 500 in 2010, which is an increase of 5 000 on the previous year. This figure is predicted to reach 100 000 by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, more people than ever are living with HIV, with an average of two people per week being newly diagnosed as HIV positive. While that number remains relatively low, figures released this week show a rise of 20%, with the majority of new cases being diagnosed among men.</p>
      <p sl="en">In light of these figures and the World Health Organisation’s confirmation that 33.4 million people worldwide live with HIV, including 2.1 million children, it is my belief that education throughout Member States is vital for prevention, which, alongside early diagnosis and access to treatment, can play an essential part in limiting the spread of HIV. It is time to eradicate people’s fear of being tested for the HIV virus. Due to the stigma and fear attached to an HIV-positive diagnosis, people are coming forward for testing after the point at which treatment for their infection should have begun, which greatly worsens their prognosis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The advances in HIV treatment in the last 30 years since the virus emerged have been massive, but too many people still test late and fail to benefit.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the representative of the Polish Presidency, I have the honour of presenting the position of the European Union and the Member States on the occasion of World AIDS Day, as agreed with the European Commission and then adopted by the Council on 28 November 2011.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, on World AIDS Day 2011, when we are marking the fight against AIDS, the European Union and the Member States are joining people around the world in commemorating relatives, friends and loved ones lost to AIDS, and reiterating their commitment to supporting all people living with HIV and those affected by the AIDS epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This year, we are celebrating a special anniversary: it was exactly 30 years ago that the world learned about HIV and AIDS. In December 1981, the first cases of AIDS were discovered. During these 30 years of struggle and sacrifice for millions of people, over 30 million people have lost their lives and 16 million children have been orphaned due to AIDS. HIV and AIDS have affected every country and many communities and families. It is estimated that there are currently 33.3 million people living with HIV worldwide, and that each day, 7 000 people are infected with AIDS, mainly in low and medium-income countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The last 30 years have also been a time of engagement and partnership to a hitherto unseen extent. The fight against HIV has taught us the significance of partnership and dialogue, and we have learned that human rights and human dignity should always be in the spotlight. Impressive progress has led to a decrease of nearly 20% in the number of new HIV infections worldwide in the last decade, and to a decrease of almost 19% in the number of AIDS-related deaths in the years 2004-2009. The greatest progress has been made in the area most affected, that is, in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to two thirds of all people infected with HIV.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union is proud of the fact that the efforts it has undertaken, together with key partners such as UNAIDS, the WHO, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, people living with HIV and civil society, have helped to achieve remarkable advances in the global fight against HIV and AIDS. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria amounted to nearly USD 1.5 billion, which represents 53% of total contributions to this fund (taking into account total contributions from the European Commission and the Member States).</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nevertheless, more than 8 million people living in low and medium-income countries still need access to effective treatment, and the number of new infections still exceeds the number of people entering therapy. This means that HIV and AIDS are still one of the biggest barriers these countries face on their road towards development. In seven countries, including five countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the number of HIV infections increased by more than 25% between 2001 and 2009. Through partnerships with these countries, the European Union will intensify its efforts to change this intolerable situation, calling for the urgent stepping up of prevention programmes and services at regional and national level, which may help to eradicate HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union will play a decisive role in the fight against HIV and AIDS by strengthening its leading position, and by better adapting the activities of the institutions of the European Union to the changing context as regards HIV at global and European level. The challenge for us now is to retain AIDS as a priority and to accelerate actions taken at global, regional, national and local level in order to end this epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the comprehensive review of progress made in terms of meeting the obligations arising from all the Millennium Development Goals of the year 2000, and the ambitious targets for 2015 as set out in the political declaration on HIV/AIDS entitled ‘Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS’, adopted at the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on AIDS in June 2011. Achieving these objectives will bring us closer to a world with no new HIV infections, no AIDS-related deaths and no discrimination. The European Union joins the community of people taking action against the AIDS epidemic by supporting the UNAIDS strategy: zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero HIV/AIDS-related deaths – ‘Getting to zero’ – and, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, it confirms its willingness to participate in achieving the joint task of defeating the HIV epidemic. We reaffirm the commitment of the European Union to working towards the 2015 targets, which include the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in 15 million people infected with HIV, a halving of the number of sexually transmitted infections, a halving of the number of HIV infections among intravenous drug users, the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission and a significant reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union stresses that prevention is the most effective way to halt the HIV epidemic. We need to ensure that preventive strategies are comprehensive, and are developed on the basis of available knowledge with full respect for human rights and understanding of the local context, making the fullest possible use of existing methods of prevention and, at the same time, promoting new methods and technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union notes with concern the fact that women and girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection due to physiological, economic and social factors, inequalities and gender-related violence. Women and girls constitute more than 50% of all people living with HIV, and HIV and AIDS remain the most important cause of morbidity and mortality for women of child-bearing age. The European Union will therefore step up its activities to promote an approach which takes into account issues relating to gender, gender equality and the empowerment of women, as well as actions to promote women’s rights, in particular, the right to protect themselves against hazardous sexual behaviour, especially in the context of combating human trafficking and all forms of sexual exploitation. At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting responsible behaviour, especially among men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union draws particular attention to populations most at risk of infection, including men who have sexual relations with men, intravenous drug users, migrants, prisoners, ethnic minorities, persons providing paid sexual services and their clients. These populations are often marginalised and it can be difficult to reach out to them, which increases their vulnerability to HIV infection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we note with concern that most young people still have only limited access to programmes on sexual and reproductive health, providing information, skills, services and social support. It is vital to ensure wide access to specially designed prevention programmes and services, including confidential HIV testing and counselling, high-quality male and female condoms at affordable prices, comprehensive sex education, harm reduction programmes and other available prevention measures. While planning effective HIV prevention and care, one should not forget about the prevention and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are calling for closer cooperation in this area, and the inclusion of HIV and AIDS programmes in basic health care, including programmes on sexual and reproductive health, and a strengthening of programmes and services related to the prevention and treatment of all these diseases.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union recognises the need for greater involvement of people living with HIV or AIDS in all aspects of the planning, implementation and monitoring of prevention and support policies, strategies and programmes. We are aware of the crucial role played by non-governmental organisations, including organisations which bring together people and groups affected by HIV to support national and local actions in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the substantial increase in the availability of antiretroviral treatment. However, it notes with concern the differences in availability from region to region. Currently, more than 6.5 million people in low and medium-income countries are receiving antiretroviral treatment. However, there are still 8 million people who are eligible for medical treatment but who are deprived of the opportunity to receive such treatment. The results of recent research on the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs have opened up more opportunities for HIV prevention and make it possible to fight the epidemic more effectively. We wish to emphasise our commitment to universal access to antiretroviral treatment, care and support for people living with HIV or AIDS, and the importance of involvement and investment at national level, taking into account respect for the dignity, rights and freedoms of HIV-infected persons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the significant decrease in the number of new mother-to-child transmitted HIV infections. We reaffirm our commitment to actions aimed at universal access to the prevention of vertical infections in order to eliminate HIV infections among children and to save the lives of their mothers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union reaffirms that all persons living with HIV or AIDS, in particular, children and young people, should be able to benefit from the best available methods of care, treatment and support. Once again, we emphasise the need to integrate issues relating to HIV/AIDS and reproductive and sexual health rights into strategies and programmes at local, national, regional and international level. The Member States should protect persons living with HIV or AIDS against discrimination, stigmatisation and deprivation of their rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The EU also confirms its commitment to, and support for, the abolition of restrictions on the right of entry and short- and long-term residence for people living with HIV, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the elimination of laws punishing it, since such legislation neither provides appropriate tools to fight the epidemic nor supports populations particularly vulnerable to infection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union acknowledges that in times of economic crisis, the appropriate allocation of available resources, including health promotion and preventive actions, is a key issue. We therefore reiterate our firm commitment to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes and services that have already been implemented, and to strengthening national health care systems and the human resources necessary to provide health care, education and social services, which are critical for the prevention and treatment of HIV infections and care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and their support. Only by continuing our work and stepping up high-quality and effective measures, and by remedying existing shortcomings in all regards, will the European Union as a whole, and each of its Member States individually, be able to contribute significantly to reducing the number of new infections, instances of stigmatisation and discrimination and AIDS-related deaths.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, I would like to thank all those who participated in this discussion for the powerful message that is being put across in order to go on battling HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This strong message has become increasingly important nowadays, due to the austerity measures that Europe is undergoing, which call for a reduction of many of the resources that were being allocated to the health sector. Our message today needs to focus on budget cuts in our countries that tackle the squandering of money and not the reduction of funds for programmes such as HIV/AIDS, especially in light of the considerable investment required for its prevention.</p>
      <p sl="mt">These last few years have witnessed substantial progress in the battle against this illness. However, we are still nowhere near to fulfilling our main objective of a zero figure in terms of new infections, zero deaths due to AIDS, and zero discrimination. Nonetheless, I can guarantee full commitment on the part of the Commission in its determination to go on working relentlessly in order to achieve these goals. We must keep up our fight against discrimination, which is a great scourge among many European countries, and ensure access to care for all those who are infected or in danger of becoming infected by this illness, both within Europe and outside it. However, as some of you have also said, a more vigorous effort is required in educating our people, our citizens, on everything that has to do with HIV/AIDS infection.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I augur a steady continuation of all our efforts in this regard. On the part of the Commission, we are conducting a platform, a so called think-tank against AIDS/HIV which is made up of Member State, where we try to promote best practices amongst each Member State to the best of our ability, in order to ensure better coordinated action and, in turn, to yield better results.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At a time when the number of people infected with HIV has risen both in Europe (2.2 million people according to the 2009 data) and globally (34 million people infected with HIV, marking a 17% rise on the level a decade ago), it is time for the European executive to conduct a major analysis of its own action strategy for preventing the number of people affected by this disease from increasing. The statistics currently available indicate that this rise in the number of patients results from two different trends: the continuing increase in the number of people infected with HIV and the rise in the life expectancy of people with this disease, as a result of the discovery of new treatments and drugs. In these circumstances, the European executive must look at the directions of the strategic action for preventing the spread of the HIV infection, with the aim of making social and health policies applied at this level more effective, as well as at the policies for investment in research, prevention, treatment and support for patients, with the aim of spreading good practices and European models.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today reminds us that the numbers are terrible: 30 years – 60 million HIV infections, 30 million deaths. What is even worse is that we are talking about a fully preventable disease, but with a growing number of infections! The targets are ambitious; the spread of HIV/AIDS should be reversed by 2015. But how do we get there? I would like to emphasise three points. First, prevention. Equitable, universal access to prevention is necessary, together with adequate information, sex education and access to means of protection. Of course, when it comes to prevention, we shall mention vaccination as well which has already helped to lower and then freeze the number of new HIV infections to 2.7 million per year. Second, anti-discrimination. We should make sure that people suffering from HIV/AIDS are not discriminated and not stigmatised. Third, the gender aspect. We should bear in mind that women are more vulnerable than men in getting affected. This again shows the importance of, and the need for, ensuring women’s rights and autonomy. All this requires serious, long-term political and financial engagement and support.</p>

      <p sl="en">I stand behind this resolution and the effort to bring Member States together in order to address serious issues, such as the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in the EU and nearby nations. This report accurately points out that disease knows no borders. In the same way, we as members of the EU need to look past our national differences in order to make a positive impact on Europe as a whole. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in EU Member States as well as surrounding nations is a serious matter, with over 2.2 million people in the European region suffering from the disease. Together, we can fight this life-threatening disease and help alleviate the harm it causes to those who suffer from it. I propose that in order to truly fight the ongoing epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Europe, we focus on not only treatment but also disease prevention. It is important for the EU to work together, pool research and resources, and then to branch out in order to meet specific needs of various nations and regions. Only through these united efforts can we seriously combat the danger that HIV/AIDS presents to our society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It has become necessary to review the plan to combat HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries for the period 2009-2013 due to rapid progress in research on the nature of this disease and methods of treatment. In May 2011, a new antiviral drug was registered. It is essential to revise the objectives of further research, as well as the arrangements for funding and the level of such funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As in any field, the most effective approach is prevention. Since HIV does not produce any symptoms for a long period (about 10 years on average), systematic prophylactic tests are necessary. We also need effective information and educational campaigns. Their targets should primarily be the high-risk groups. In Poland, for example, about 50% of HIV infections are in people between 20 and 29 years of age.</p>
      <p sl="pl">HIV-infected patients and those suffering from AIDS face not only the disease itself, but also discrimination and stigmatisation, and often also a lack of financial resources for treatment. Intolerance makes it more difficult to find work, the result of which is poverty, and which, in turn, increases the risk of the disease spreading, thus closing the vicious circle. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘The killer is not AIDS. Stigma, discrimination and ostracism are the real killers’. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, held on 1 December, I hereby appeal for understanding and institutional support for all those suffering from the disease.</p>

      <p sl="en">With today being World Aids day, it is quite fitting that the Parliament should vote on the motion for resolution on the EU’s global response to HIV/AIDS. Despite efforts having been made to reduce the number of new infections within the EU and neighbouring countries, progress on the 2009 Commission strategy, which aimed at doing this, has been unsatisfactory. I am quite alarmed that an estimate for the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed that around 30% of HIV-positive people are still not diagnosed. Furthermore, these undiagnosed patients have three and a half times higher risk of transmitting HIV than those who have been diagnosed. What’s more, those that have been diagnosed with HIV are still presenting themselves late for care and, consequently, progress to late stages of infection before they are diagnosed and can start treatment. It is therefore imperative that there are better resources allocated to ensure fair access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment support and medical research, along with continuing implementing measures to address the continued discrimination and stigma attached to those infected with HIV. It is therefore only right that I voted in favour of this motion for resolution.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Ramon Tremosa i Balcells, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB annual report for 2010 [2011/2156(INI)] (A7-0361/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to warmly welcome the new President of the European Central Bank, Mr Mario Draghi, and on behalf of all of us in the European Parliament, wish him every success in his very difficult task.</p>

      <p sl="it">President Draghi, may I welcome you to this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, I want to thank the shadows, assistants and advisers for their very good collaboration on this report. Today, we shall discuss the ECB report which was largely approved in the ECON committee last month. On debt crisis management, I welcome the ECB’s interventions in the markets. If necessary, I encourage them to continue these in the next weeks. These interventions have saved the euro; without them, the situation now would be worse.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also deplore the hesitation in management of the crisis by the European Commission and by Member States, particularly those countries lacking reforms, as that has often pushed the ECB to act. We also express worries in the report about the limits of ECB interventions; monetary policy cannot solve every problem. Every country is responsible for its own fiscal situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot ignore that there is a growing exposure to risky assets in the ECB balance sheet. The ECB is right now a lender of last resort. For the banking sector, the ECB has been a lender of last resort since May 2010. There has been an unlimited credit flow from the ECB to eurozone banks. Those banks have been buying huge amounts of public debt from eurozone governments. This massive ECB help may have taken away, or delayed, incentives to carry out reforms in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the report, we voted to reinforce economic governance. I believe that fiscal discipline is a precondition for more European integration. I think that national and regional budgets should be supervised at the European level. The report we voted on also shares Mr Trichet’s opinion regarding the need for a European Minister of Finance to coordinate a basic common fiscal policy and to enhance the effectiveness of the euro. This debt crisis shows that in a monetary union, fiscal policy cannot be exclusively left to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report we adopted also stresses the need for a European Treasury to relieve the ECB of its quasi-fiscal role. Until then, we suggest entrusting more tasks to the European Stability Mechanism. Mr Draghi, I would welcome your views on these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, concerning transparency, I call for the publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings, as is the case with the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Sweden. I consider non-publication a sign of weakness of the monetary union. We need public and individual accountability in the decision-making processes. With this in mind, we will vote today for the publication of the summary of Governing Council meetings. We hope that the ECB will listen to the democratic voice of this Chamber in this respect.</p>

    <intervention id="4-031-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Mario Draghi" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Central Bank">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am delighted to be making my first appearance here as President of the ECB and I am honoured to present to you the ECB Annual Report for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing I wish to do is pay homage to my predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet. During all his tenure, he had a very fruitful and very constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and I intend to continue on this route with the same force, the same strength that he displayed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s session is an opportunity for us to take a wider perspective on ECB policies. In that way, I will also touch on a number of the broader themes of the resolution of the European Parliament. Let me begin with a few words on the main monetary policy decisions we have taken and the challenges we have faced during 2010 and 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the ECB’s monetary policy is constantly guided by the goal of maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. And when I say this, I mean price stability in either direction. This applies to both the setting of official interest rates and the implementation of non-standard measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">This autumn, tensions in financial markets have intensified again with very adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence. Downside risks to the economic outlook have increased. The weaker degree of activity is itself moderating price, cost and wage pressures. It is in this context that the ECB decided to reduce its key interest rates by 25 basis points in early November 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dysfunctional government bond markets in several euro area countries hamper the single monetary policy because the way this policy is transmitted to the real economy depends also on the conditions of the bond markets in the various countries. An impaired transmission mechanism for monetary policy has a damaging effect on the availability and price of credit to firms and households.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the very important monetary policy reason for the ECB’s non-standard measures. But of course, such interventions can only be limited. Governments must – individually and collectively – restore their credibility vis-à-vis financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tensions in sovereign bond markets have been accompanied by stress in the banking sector given the financial interlinkages between governments and banks. The ECB has taken several measures in 2010 and 2011 to ensure that banks continue to have access to funding sources. This has enabled them to continue lending to firms and households.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, the ECB has extended its policy of fully allotting liquidity demanded by banks at fixed rates against collateral. The maximum maturity of these liquidity-providing operations was first extended to six months and then later to 12 and 13 months. A new Covered Bond Purchase Programme has recently been initiated, with a size of EUR 40 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, liquidity in US dollars has been offered to banks for three-month periods. Yesterday, in a globally coordinated action with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, we have agreed to lower the price on US dollar provision in other constituencies, including the euro area. We have furthermore agreed, as a contingency measure, to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction in any of the currencies, should market conditions so warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the ECB’s Governing Council meets on Thursday next week, we are now in the pre-decision period, and nothing that I say should in any way be interpreted in terms of future monetary policy decisions. But as far as the current situation is concerned, there is frankly not much more to say beyond what I have said in recent statements.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware of the continuing difficulties for banks due to the stress on sovereign bonds, the tightness of funding markets and the scarcity of eligible collateral in some financial segments. We are also aware of the problems of maturity mismatches on balance sheets, the challenges of raising levels of capital and the cyclical risks related to the downturn.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the overall functioning of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union. Looking back at 2010 and 2011, notable progress has been achieved in reinforcing economic governance – though I recognise that this may not be evident in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament has contributed decisively to that progress, and the ECB commends its work. The ‘six-pack’, the European Semester, the Euro Plus Pact: all these initiatives have set the stage for closer coordination and more intensive scrutiny of economic policies in the EU, particularly in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet we are at a difficult stage at present. We have set up these new mechanisms, but their positive effects on the credibility of government fiscal policies are not yet visible. And the government changes that have taken place in some of the more exposed countries have not yet had much of an effect on the continuing fragility of financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamental questions are being raised and they call for an answer. At the heart of these questions are not only the credibility of governments’ policies and the actual delivery of the promised reforms, but also the overall design of our common fiscal governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that the new surveillance framework will restore confidence over time. I am also quite sure that countries overall are on the right track. But a credible signal is needed to give ultimate assurance over the short term.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I believe our economic and monetary union needs is a new fiscal compact – a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the mutual fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as we effectively have a compact that describes the essence of monetary policy – an independent central bank with a single objective of maintaining price stability – so a fiscal compact would enshrine the essence of fiscal rules and the government commitments taken so far, and ensure that the latter become fully credible, individually and collectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">We might be asked whether a new fiscal compact would be enough to stabilise markets and how a credible longer-term vision can be helpful in the short term. Our answer is that it is definitely the most important element to start restoring credibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other elements might follow, but the sequencing matters. And it is, first and foremost, important to get a commonly shared fiscal compact right. Confidence works backwards: if there is an anchor in the long term, it is easier to maintain trust in the short term. After all, investors are themselves often taking decisions with a long-term horizon, especially with regard to government bonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new fiscal compact would be the most important signal from euro area governments for embarking on a path of comprehensive deepening of economic integration. It would also present a clear trajectory for the future evolution of the euro area, thus framing expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the precise legal process that brings about a move towards a genuine economic union, we should keep our options open. Far-reaching Treaty changes should not be discarded, but faster processes are also conceivable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whatever the approach, companies, markets and the citizens of Europe expect policy makers to act decisively to resolve the crisis. It is time to adapt the euro area design with a set of institutions, rules and processes that is commensurate with the requirements of monetary union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and welcome Mr Draghi on his first appearance here. I also want to welcome what he said about Treaty changes and the need for faster responses. In addition, I welcome the ECB support for liquidity across the European Union, without which we would not have been able to survive so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are really serious questions facing us at this perilous crossroads in European history. The issue of eurobonds and the need for a lender of last resort is high on the agenda, whether that lender is the European Central Bank or the EFSF or some other mechanism. The hour has arrived and we cannot dither any longer. This is the difficulty that we face and, if we do require Treaty change, then let us go ahead on some pro forma basis on the presumption that that Treaty change will be approved by Member States retrospectively. If it works, they will pass it, but passing Treaty changes takes time. In some countries, we may even need a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we do not have that time. It may be said that there is a strict legal requirement, but this is like saying that we cannot turn the Titanic right or left because the traffic light does not permit it. Let it trundle on, crash and we will then put the lifeboats out and pick up whoever is left. The European project, and the euro in particular, cannot be allowed to go the same route as the Titanic.</p>
      <p sl="en">In natural justice, which, in my belief, precedes written law, our leaders must act now. We are in peril. This is not a job for politicians. It is a job for statesmen and stateswomen. I hope that we will rise to the occasion. I think we should all be asked to read and re-read the speech that the Polish Foreign Minister made in Germany very recently. I think what he has to say is really imperative for all of us to understand and to know to secure the future of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, allow me to welcome President Draghi to the European Parliament. I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Tremosa, for his excellent cooperation on this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against the current backdrop of financial instability, the European Central Bank has, in practical terms, a fundamental role to play. However, as I see it, the actions taken by this institution to address the turbulent conditions evident on the financial markets are still inadequate. However, the bank’s independence must be preserved, and it must become, in practical terms, as you stated, a lender of last resort for the euro area countries, taking action to tackle speculation and the deterioration in the crisis situation. At a practical level, if the bank assumed its role as a central bank, this would help significantly to boost confidence in the robustness of the euro area’s architecture.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, a beefed-up role for the European Central Bank must be supplemented by radical measures, so to speak, such as issuing common euro area bonds, harmonising Member States’ taxation systems and strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility. In this regard, I support the proposal tabled by the Commission on 23 November for issuing common euro area bonds. I believe that Member States must realise that these bonds have to be issued to ensure the financial markets’ stability and that each of them stands to gain from a solution based on solidarity. This would, at a practical level, reduce the overall cost of the debt and would ensure the European financial markets’ liquidity. I would like to make one more, final point, which I personally believe: the European currency cannot function without fiscal union which will, in practical terms, complete monetary union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Draghi, we are delighted to see you again today. I have to say that I would have liked a few more Members to have been in plenary to pay tribute to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me start with a point on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB). I think it is very good that this has been stressed unambiguously by Ms Merkel, Mr Monti and Mr Sarkozy. It is also a concept very dear to the European Parliament. Of course, the principle of independence means even greater responsibility for you personally, together with the members of the Executive Board and the Governing Council, but we trust you to take the right decisions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, all the current speculation surrounding what the ECB could or should do, but also, I should say, regarding your internal organisation, seems to me to be detrimental to the euro and the independence of the Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to highlight another issue: communication. It is only natural that there should be a discussion – and in view of the magnitude of the issues, a lively discussion – between the members of the Governing Council. Yet once the decisions have been taken, I personally would like a team spirit to prevail, whereby decisions are defended in the European general interest, which takes precedence over all national considerations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I share Parliament’s desire for greater transparency, but at the moment, the problem is not publishing the minutes, but rather preventing certain individuals from making claims in their national media that do not necessarily correspond to what has been decided collectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is often said that politicians talk too much. It is often said that women talk too much. I suspect that some male technocrats need to learn to hold their tongues. You yourself have been tactful in your communications, and we honour you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me stress that we have a single Treaty, a single currency and probably have a shared interest in discipline. I hope, Mr President, that you find the same desire for discipline and compliance in your own house when it comes to defending the unity of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the rest, we wish you well. We are counting on you.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, the debate currently raging between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy and others concerning the future role of the ECB needs mentioning. Above all else, the independence of the ECB needs to be upheld, particularly in times of crisis. Credibility is key. If eurozone members want the ECB to act as the lender of last resort, they should legitimise this role as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECB should not be a political football for point scoring between national politicians. Perhaps, as well as looking at the measures other institutions should or should not be taking, Member States themselves should be looking to get their own houses in order. I include eurozone and non-eurozone members in this plea. We passed the ‘six-pack’ on economic governance two plenary sessions ago. Member States should be looking to implement it as soon as they can, introducing credible and robust measures suited to their own countries to bring their budget deficits back down to acceptable levels. Credibility really is key.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Mr Draghi, the statutory role of the European Central Bank, to maintain price stability without heed for the repercussions on the real economy, has proven to be catastrophic under the present circumstances. The ECB annual report for 2010 emphasises as much. I propose that the role of the European Central Bank should be changed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, in 2010, the European Central Bank hid behind inflation and, as a result: firstly, it failed to halt rocketing spreads; secondly, it failed to halt action by the speculation mafia in credit rating agencies, which it has incorporated into its charter; thirdly, it kept interest rates high – you, Mr Draghi, reduced them somewhat recently – in a period of recession, higher than in the United States and higher than in Great Britain.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the independence of the European Central Bank is a very moot point. Independent bankers are being ‘canonised’ to the point of being made prime ministers, as we have seen in two countries. Consequently, the European Central Bank is being politically manipulated. Political parliamentary control of the European Central Bank needs to change.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London.</p>
      <p sl="en">The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Central Bank (ECB) is solely responsible for the stability of the monetary value of the euro. As we are all aware, its main task is to keep inflation under control within the monetary union. With its intervention in the bond markets, which began in May 2010 and have so far involved more than EUR 200 billion being spent on government bonds from heavily indebted euro countries, the ECB has definitely exceeded its mandate. The ECB may see its purchases as being an important means of stabilising the capital markets but, in fact, by entering the grey area between fiscal and monetary policy, the ECB has not in any way reduced the interest burden on the euro crisis countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once its credibility has been lost, the resulting costs, as we know, will be enormous. In my opinion, the ECB must not, under any circumstances, continue to take the wrong path in this crisis. As a result of a number of different incorrect decisions, we are now on the threshold between an inflationary economic boom and a deflationary economic collapse. The important thing for us now is to avert, at any price, the real threat of the economically successful countries in the euro area being dragged into the abyss as well.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all, let me welcome President Draghi to his first visit to Parliament. I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Tremosa, on the excellent job he has done in describing in an outstanding and comprehensible way the price stability in the euro area, as well as all the measures the ECB had to guarantee in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the future, the ECB will continue to have a special responsibility with regard to EU monetary policy and its coherence, and in applying an appropriate interest rate policy, as it indeed did in 2010. In my opinion, the ECB does need to be capable of intervening in the fight against the debt crisis and must, where appropriate, facilitate liquidity by purchasing government securities that are deemed too risky. It should do so with the aim of allowing the Member States concerned a moment of respite so as to be able to once again introduce investment-friendly, economically invigorating measures. Of course, all this needs to be undertaken under appropriate financial supervision.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Similarly, I welcome the idea to look into ways in which the ECB can contribute to the creation of a European Monetary Fund to ensure that there is no need for the IMF to be involved in credit policy, and thereby to reduce Member States’ dependence on international institutions. It is a sound idea and needs to be investigated, and impact assessments need to be prepared as to ways in which a mechanism for the issuance of eurobonds can be created in the future. Furthermore, as a fellow Member has also mentioned, I believe it is very important to ensure appropriate communications in the interest of credibility. I therefore endorse the proposal of the rapporteur that the minutes of meetings of the Governing Council should be made public, and consider it a good idea. To President Draghi, I wish sufficient determination and all the best for his future work.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mr Bloom, thank you for your question. However, I already have reservations regarding the way the question is formulated, because you approach the issue in a very polarised manner. The economic situation is, in fact, fraught with crisis. If the ECB does not take a prominent role in this regard, and does not take a firm position, the situation you refer to in your question will indeed become reality. I do not think it is appropriate to ask whose money would pay for this, as the single EU monetary policy will have to provide suitable resources for this in the future. If it fails to do so, then we could indeed speak not only of the crisis, but also of the failure of the euro area, but I do not see eye to eye with you on this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, today’s debate is not the only one to revolve around the issue of whether the single currency can be saved by a change to the Treaty of Lisbon, closer fiscal coordination, the dependence or independence of the European Central Bank, a European Minister for Finance or the European Monetary Fund. In my opinion, the question should be asked in more general – and also far more serious – terms. Is this a euro crisis or a debt crisis? In this context, we should consider whether debts are a cause or a consequence of the current situation, and whether the crisis is about debts arising over the past few years or debts that are the consequence of European development over many decades. In this case, I believe there is no need to regard the current difficulties of the euro as a euro crisis, because the current difficulties merely revealed the profound structural problems of part of the European area. The call for Member States to follow a more fiscally responsible policy is therefore correct. Nevertheless, we are faced with the question here of whether there will be a change in the behaviour of people accustomed to the very high standards of the European social state or the European welfare state. Unless we have the courage to make significant reforms, and to transform the social welfare state, thus getting rid of high budgetary costs, then it will be very difficult to get out of the current difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have here a ransom note that was sent to the Italian Government on 5 August and sets forth a detailed prescription of austerity measures that had to be implemented. Every one of these measures involves attacks on the rights and living standards of working class people. The note is signed off by you, Mr Draghi, as well as by Jean-Claude Trichet, and comes from the European Central Bank. It finishes with a line that is fairly ominous: ‘We trust that the government will take all the appropriate actions’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The hostage here, of course, was the threat not to buy Italian bonds. Within the Troika, the ECB has been aggressively pushing the austerity measures that have pushed people to misery in Ireland, Portugal and Greece. The ECB has also been a central co-conspirator in the silent coups that have now been carried out in Greece and in Italy, replacing elected governments with governments of bankers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could you now please drop the pretence that has been repeated here today, that the ECB is in some way independent? It is independent only of any democratic checks and any accountability to ordinary people. It is subservient to the interests of the capitalist classes, the rich in the core euro countries, and it has acted as their shock troops throughout this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Central Bank has performed its role reasonably well – as well as it could – during the crisis; it has succeeded in keeping inflation low and intervened by buying bonds to limit financial instability.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not agree with those who would like to change the ECB’s formula or equip it with new powers: the ECB will never be the Federal Reserve, because Europe is different from the United States. In future, however, the Central Bank must refrain from intervening on every little issue with its public missives. It is right to indicate the objectives that should be achieved, but intervention methods must be left up to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Recently, the issue of government bonds has dramatically emerged. It is unacceptable to force a country that is struggling, and burdened by the constraints of the euro, to pay interest rates that are much higher than those applied to the other Member States. A solution must be found through the use of eurobonds to prevent a country in crisis from having insult added to injury.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, President Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Italian delegation in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), may I welcome you to this House in your role as the new President of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are laying down rules on budgets and on more rigorous fiscal discipline, but what we need right now are immediate responses, and I have the impression that the debate and the timetable in relation to eurobonds require time, which is something that we do not have. Rather, we need measures to promote growth and to prevent stagnation. The ECB has played an important role in the current crisis by buying government bonds that are subject to speculation and keeping interest rates and inflation low. Perhaps more than any other European institution, it has acted swiftly and effectively, but the crisis has become a crisis of our common currency, of the euro, which does not have the support that a currency should have. The ECB lacks the effectiveness and the authoritativeness of a proper central bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">The idea, floated recently, that the ECB may finance the Member States indirectly, in other words, by going through the International Monetary Fund and so managing to play a leading role in tackling the debt crisis, circumventing the restrictions laid down by statute, is hearsay, and I question whether there is really any truth in it. This is further evidence of the need to move on from the ECB and create a proper European central bank that is not only a guarantee and supervisory body but also a currency issuer.</p>
      <p sl="it">Like the US Federal Reserve, the ECB must become a lender of last resort, a currency guarantor, as happens for the dollar and the pound. This would also contribute towards the creation, Mr President, of the Europe of solidarity and of the Member States that our founding fathers, from Adenauer to Spinelli and De Gasperi, wanted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is not a mere stroke of bad luck that we find ourselves close to the edge of a catastrophe. It is simply a calculated act of brinkmanship on the part of all actors involved in the fate of the euro which has brought us to this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘Brinkmanship’ is defined as a calculated practice of pushing a situation to the brink of disaster in order to win an advantage from your opponent. We have witnessed brinkmanship by the creditor countries in the eurozone in order to extract the best terms possible from the debtor countries by minimising moral hazard and thus ensuring that they participate fully in the austerity programme laid out for them, as per the conditionality clause, and to do this with the consent of the majority of the population in one form or other; brinkmanship by the indebted countries, knowing full well that it is not in the interest of the eurozone paymaster to let them default; brinkmanship by the European Central Bank, which refuses to be drawn into the position of lender of last resort with the hope that the eurozone will find its own political solutions; brinkmanship by those in the European Parliament who spent endless hours upping the sanctions within the ‘six-pack’ and making sure that this time round, they securely lock the stable doors, ignoring the observation that the horse has already bolted; and brinkmanship by the Council, who earlier on in the year made such words as ‘eurobonds’ and ‘voluntary haircuts’ taboo, hoping that the ‘six-pack’ would provide a silver bullet.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, brinkmanship through a valid process has its dangers. We are in danger of going down in history as a political class who, because of being smart with these actions and strategies, presided over the collapse of the euro and global depression. Technically, the solutions have been known to all who wanted to see and listen. In whatever shape or form, they include instruments which combine an element of joint liability among all eurozone Member States and a watertight solution to the moral hazard issue. So let us act collectively on these core principles, for the rest is detail. But we must act now before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner, Governor, in 2010, the European Central Bank (ECB) applied the mechanism of purchasing euro area state bonds on secondary markets, despite opposition from several countries. In recent days, however, it has, for the first time, failed to sterilise these purchases. It needed to take out EUR 203.5 billion from the interbank market, but demand for its seven-day sterilisation operations was EUR 194.2 billion. This shows us that European banks are holding cash and not providing it even to the Central Bank, and also that the volume of bonds purchased is getting to be too high for the Bank to sterilise, and it has failed to increase the volume of euros in the financial system through bond purchases. If this trend of unsuccessful sterilisation operations continues, it will mean the equivalent of quantitative easing for the euro area, and thus a negative impact on the purchasing power of the European currency. It is therefore necessary, Governor, to modify ECB policy in a very sensitive way, in order to provide better protection for the euro and for the price stability of the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his work on this report, although the focus of the debate is less about 2010 and more about the future. I welcome Mr Draghi to the European Parliament. His predecessor, Mr Trichet, is a household name in Ireland, and I dare say his name, too, will reach that status, if it has not already – although I note yesterday that our Finance Minister, Mr Noonan, said that you were a man of fewer words than your predecessor. Well, I want to thank you for your words here this morning. They were considered, as we would expect from someone in your position, but they were also very clear. They were spoken with the solemness that is required of all of us on this occasion.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do need to restore confidence. It is a very difficult thing to do once it is sundered. I look at Mr Bloom here, who asked questions and constantly does – as you do in a democracy – and I would say ‘be careful what you wish for’ because this is not a problem for the European Union or for the eurozone: the problem we have is a global one, and if you get your wish that the euro should fail and that this House should fall, your country, too, will face incredible problems. I would like us, in the heat of debate, to realise the significance of words on the efforts to restore confidence. This is about people I represent who need to know that those who are elected and in power will do the right thing on their behalf.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to move away, and I think we have, from the blame game that has happened in the past, because we now know that this is a much bigger problem for all of us.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, in Mr Tremosa i Balcells’ report, the European Parliament fully acknowledges that the European Central Bank has played an active and decisive role throughout the crisis, since turmoil broke out on the financial markets in 2007 and 2008, up to the point, of course, when it intervened in the secondary government bond markets in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, we know and you know that, as the crisis developed, it was not contained and has now become systemic and, of course, it is obvious that this is not the responsibility of the European Central Bank. As the European Parliament has systematically and repeatedly pointed out, the spread and propagation of the crisis was the result of hesitation and indecisiveness and delays in taking and applying the right decisions, primarily at political level by the governments of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, yesterday’s decision by the European Central Bank to which you referred, to coordinate its action at global level with the five biggest central banks in order to increase liquidity in the global financial system, doubtless has a positive dimension. It is a decision that will have beneficial results, temporarily. We all know that an immediate, effective, global response to the crisis is needed, a response that goes beyond and combines with the rules of stricter fiscal prudence to which you referred, in a new fiscal compact, as you called it.</p>
      <p sl="el">As other Members have said, we absolutely respect the independence of the European Central Bank which, however, apart from price stability, is the guardian of the euro, the common currency, and it is primarily this role that you are urgently being called upon to play. You know and we know that there is no way out of the crisis without a stronger role for the European Central Bank. It is, of course, up to you and the executive officer of the European Central Bank to consider all the proposals and to decide how.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is important to note that the European Central Bank (ECB) has done a good job so far during the euro crisis. With the latest interest rate reductions, interest rate policy has been returned to a reasonable level and the support programme for purchasing the bonds of the weakest countries in the euro area was necessary and balanced. The fact that the ECB has started to use a larger range of instruments than those traditionally used has been justified in view of the circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The crisis is a long way from being over, however. We are currently facing a situation in which the entire monetary union is at risk. An unexpected disturbance could upset the extremely fragile balance in state finances and on the financial markets. A second case like Lehman Brothers is, unfortunately, not an entirely unimaginable scenario.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this situation, a whole host of measures obviously need to be taken from a political standpoint. At the same time, there can be no doubt that part of the solution must also be for the European Central Bank to take a more active role. It must be possible in some way for the bank to act as a lender of last resort. This would improve stability in the monetary union in both the short and the long term.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A more active involvement is, of course, associated with increased risks in the bank’s balance sheet. However, this has to be weighed against the extremely serious risk scenario that the entire monetary union will be destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is now time for several different players to reconsider their position with regard to the ECB. The bank should be able do more than it is currently able to do. Such measures could effectively reduce the current turbulence. It is no good to simply wait and see what happens, either; measures must be taken now.

Contributing a vision is something that the ECB certainly can do, not only by returning to its roots and hence fulfilling its role to the utmost, but also by being open to discussion with this institution, because it is obvious that, once we deem Mr Tremosa i Balcell’s ideas to be relevant and conducive to a plan that we intend to carry out to improve matters, we will have enabled politics to climb out of the abyss.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the Tremosa i Balcells report that we are about to adopt, we have proposals for rethinking the architecture of the euro area, and for creating eurobonds and a European treasury, but all of this takes time.

Our problem arose because we nationalised private bank debt, which pushed our debt over 100% of GDP. Those debts were owed to French banks, to British banks, to German banks and indeed to a range of others. But we cannot survive, we cannot deal with that debt, without moving beyond the issue of fiscal consolidation and all of this language we have about fiscal discipline.

      <p sl="en">European Central Bank. – Mr President, thanks to all the honourable Members of the European Parliament for their statements and their contributions. Let me say at the very beginning that I look forward to sharing views and to exchanging opportunities to look together at the present situation and to reflect together at this very difficult contingency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think many of your statements really come under one heading: how do we reconstruct confidence in the euro in the euro area? This process will have three pillars: the first one is what I called the setting of an anchor in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">This redesign of the fiscal rules, of the fiscal compact – meaning by this word an agreement of new fiscal rules – is necessary to create trust for all countries who are members of the euro area. This design has not been completed. I think the next few days will be very important in telling us whether we will make any progress on this path. This is very important because, as I said, this gives the long-term trust which is necessary for the other two pillars.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, for the second pillar, which is the design of a financing mechanism within the euro area, we have the EFSF. It is a design in which we have to put our confidence that it will work, but some steps are still needed, as we all know.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third pillar is the national economic policy response and frankly, we are seeing much improvement on that front. As I said before, I do believe that countries are nowadays on track. We see a good future, but we have to be aware that in the end, what matters is the delivery of the proposed reforms. Reforms – I do not want to be misunderstood – do not have to be focused only on the budget and budgetary issues; they also have to be structural reforms, reforms that enhance competitiveness and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">So these are the three pillars upon which confidence can be reconstructed. I have been asked: what is the role of the ECB in all this? Some of you said the ECB should do more; some of you said the ECB should do less. Let me start by saying the ECB can act within the Treaty, so the ECB should not be asked to do things that are not within the Treaty. The ECB is the lender of last resort for solvent banks. The ECB has created an enormous amount of liquidity and we see that this liquidity is now being redeposited with the ECB deposit facility, which means that it is not so much the amount of liquidity that matters, but it is the fact that this liquidity is not actually circulating through the banking channel, through the financial system, through the credit channel.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our view, the most important thing now for the ECB is to repair the credit channel in a way that enables this liquidity to actually finance the real economy – especially the small and medium-sized enterprises which are now in difficult conditions because they are the ones who mostly need the banks’ credit. The large corporations are, on average, generally speaking, able to access capital markets on their own, so they are less dependent on the banks. That is why we have to make sure that a credit channel will start to work again. We have observed serious credit tightening in the most recent period which, combined with a weakening of the business cycle, does not bode at all well for the months to come. I think this is one of the first things.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, some of you mentioned the SMP, the Securities Market Programme, should be more active, less active. Let me say – and I did say this a moment ago – that the rationale for having the SMP active is that you want to make sure that you repair the monetary policy transmission channels. It is not to create liquidity, it is not to subsidise governments; it is to repair the monetary policy transmission channels. That was the rationale with which it started and that is still the rationale with which we employ it. By itself, it is a non-standard measure and therefore, by itself, it is going to be temporary, it is going to be limited. Let me be clear about what I mean by limited. It is not eternal and it is not infinite.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to understand that the ECB can act within the Treaty. It would be a mistake to have the ECB acting outside the Treaty; it would not be legal and it would also be a mistake because it would, especially in some parts of Europe, undermine the credibility of the ECB, which nowadays, is the strongest signature in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take the words on communication with great pleasure. It is true always, but especially in this situation of extreme difficulty, that it does not really make any sense to have a cacophony of voices anticipating monetary policy decisions, reflecting individual views and not the collegial decision-making process. I could not agree more. I will certainly take this message to the rest of the Governing Council, but, as I said, these are opportunities and occasions that are cherished very much and I will continue cherishing them. I am very much looking forward to my next meeting with the European Parliament, which is going to be in a few days with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear colleagues, thank you very much for your contributions to this debate. Mr Draghi, the ECB has rightly intervened and has prevented an even bigger disaster. The ECB has saved many Europeans from again experiencing massive bank runs. It seems that the financial markets do not trust the eurozone as an irreversible monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the pressure of the financial markets can help force the most indebted countries to curb their budgets and to increase their competitiveness. The crisis is an opportunity for more fiscal union, to underpin monetary union. The old nation states have to lose a part of their fiscal sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European crisis is also a political crisis. European citizens have discovered that the European Union does not have its own instruments to act against a huge crisis and that the European Union does not have its own resources to develop its own policies. The European Commission has been greatly weakened also by a lack of democratic legitimacy. Its President should be one of the Members of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Draghi, good luck with your work; more than ever, in the ECB we trust.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Without the euro, the global financial crisis would be much worse for all European countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The examples of this are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="sk">The historically strong pound has steadily lost value since 2008, leading to higher prices. Without the euro, the countries of Northern Europe would not have returned to growth so quickly. If the German mark had existed, it would have been so strong in relation to global currencies that German growth would have been damaged. Without the euro, the European countries that followed less sensible fiscal policies, and focused less on improving competitiveness, would have had to employ the sort of economic crisis measures adopted in Argentina in 2001. Their moral and economic collapse would have had terrible consequences.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There was a failure in one area: management of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The architects of the euro constructed the currency union, and they realised that a single currency might cause instability in countries with widely differing economic and manufacturing structures. These architects perhaps thought that steps would be taken towards greater political union when such steps were really needed. That time finally came today, with the euro area fully exposed to the effects of the debt crisis.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Francesca Balzani, José Manuel Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee in the framework of the 2012 budgetary procedure (13110/2011 – C7-0247/2011 – 17470/2011 – 2011/2020(BUD)) (A7-0414/2011).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as we have seen, the previous debate did have some bearing on the outcome of the negotiations on the 2012 budget. As the President-in-Office of the Council is with us – and let me also welcome the Commissioner, Mr Lewandowski – I would like to say how pleased I am that an agreement has been reached in conciliation on the 2012 draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This agreement will allow us to conclude the budgetary procedure within the deadlines set out in the Treaty and implementing texts. I would like to thank the Commission and congratulate the young Polish Presidency on achieving unanimity within the Council. The agreement refers both to the 2012 budget and to draft amending budget No 6/2011. I would also like to congratulate our rapporteurs, who will tell us which are the key points for the European Parliament within this budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this period of crisis, which we have discussed at length, we have succeeded in reconciling two apparently contradictory objectives, both equally necessary: on the one hand, reducing operating costs, and, on the other, maintaining essential future spending in order to support economic activity and guarantee future competitiveness. Yet, at the same time, there are two lessons that we need to learn from this achievement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lesson one is that we cannot continue to negotiate backwards, starting with payment appropriations, when political choices translate into commitment appropriations. Parliament wants the three institutions to work together with cool heads in the coming months in order to examine how the appropriations are spent and the precise requirements, line by line. This should ensure that our examination of the 2013 budget will be based on full information, avoiding another budget freeze with adjustments across the board for the third year running.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second lesson is that we have proved that we can no longer fund the European budget from national contributions. Next Monday, we will begin negotiations between Parliament and the Council, together with the Commission, on the new own resources needed to fund the European budget and reduce national contributions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For Parliament’s part – I have said it before and I say it again here formally – there can be no agreement on the next financial framework without a political agreement on going back to financing from own resources. Here and there, I hear loud voices calling for budgetary federalism. This is the best opportunity for those making those strong calls to translate their dreams into a European reality.</p>

    <intervention id="4-073-000" speaker_id="96979" name="Francesca Balzani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, first of all, please allow me to thank all those who have worked on the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions. I would thank the political groups and shadow rapporteurs for their work, and I would thank the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their excellent collaboration and excellent work, and for the results we have achieved. I would also highlight our excellent collaboration with the Bureau of the European Parliament and the work we have carried out, and the support we have had from the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets. I would stress the involvement of officials of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, specifically, the excellent technical work by the adviser, Nicole Witts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also point out the rigorous work that all the institutions have done on their administrative budgets, despite the costs of Croatia’s accession, in connection with the entry of another 18 Members to this House, the existence of new institutions and the consolidation of others, such as the European External Action Service, and as regards new tasks and competences. Despite all this, the administrative and operating budgets of all the European Union institutions have increased by just 1.3%. Given inflation and given the new commitments, this has only been possible with rigorous and efficient management, and with structural changes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The 2012 administrative budget for the institutions has grown negatively. I welcome the results of the conciliation that took place on Friday, 18 November, regarding the budgets of the European Parliament and of the other institutions. The Council adopted the European Parliament’s entire proposal on the administrative and operating costs of all the European institutions, and acknowledged that our proposal was rigorous and fair. The hard work, austerity and balancing of budget cuts, on the one hand, and the minimum necessary for each institution to run properly, on the other, has been worth it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a fact that should always be remembered: all the administrative and operating costs of all the European Union institutions correspond to less than 6% of the EU budget. This means that more than 94% of the Union budget goes on investment. It should also be remembered that the European Union budget, despite representing only 1% of Union GDP, provides an important stimulus; a benefit, through which coordinated solidarity is possible. This budget should therefore be increased, in particular during times of crisis like these.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, I welcome the increase in funds intended for economic growth, for training, for research and for young people. However, I shall finish by warning the Council of a concern: it is important to meet commitments in times of credibility; it is important to meet payment expenditure, particularly when it relates to cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is the first time we have had to negotiate the European budget during a financial crisis as serious as the one we are experiencing at this very moment. For the first time, we have succeeded in bringing this process to a positive conclusion in less time than provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. This is a great success for the European Union as a whole and for all the institutions involved. In this respect, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole and, most of all, Mr Lamassoure and the rapporteurs Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, Commissioner Lewandowski and the entire team, for approaching the discussion this year in such a constructive and responsible manner, resolving the major problems faced by the European Union in the coming year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to stress that throughout the whole process of negotiating the 2012 budget, there were no serious disputes as to the priorities of the European Union which should be financed in the future. Instead, there was a very precise and professional discussion concerning the funds which are needed to implement the priorities and how these priorities should be arranged so that European society gains the most favourable impression of EU policies, and so that these policies are directed primarily at issues where they are most eagerly anticipated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, in response to this spirit of reconciliation which prevailed in the course of our debates, the Council approved all the priorities proposed by Parliament, particularly regarding commitment appropriations. Similarly, I would like to thank you for the European Parliament’s very positive and tolerant attitude towards, and full understanding of, the priorities proposed by the Council, in particular, in relation to the payment appropriations. Parliament has shown itself to be fully open to the needs of the Member States and their budgetary situations, and to the crisis which prevails today, and has displayed a full understanding of the issues while studying the Council’s proposals in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also have the pleasure today of informing you that yesterday, during the meeting of the ECOFIN Council, the 2012 budget was adopted unanimously, while a majority voted was obtained in favour of letter of amendment No 6 to the 2011 budget, so, as far as the Council is concerned, the entire budgetary procedure for the year 2012 has been completed successfully.</p>

    <intervention id="4-076-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome, in the name of the Commission, the agreement on the 2012 budget. This timely agreement is a positive and reassuring signal, because this is about continuity and stability at this very unstable time in Europe, with so many question marks. I would also say openly that the forecasts and priorities on the part of Parliament are very responsive to the needs of Europe today. It is about competitiveness, it is about migration, and it is about additional neighbourhood policy needs, including some frontloading for Palestine also.</p>
      <p sl="en">This timely agreement reached on the 2012 budget will make for timely implementation of that budget. This is really very important. What is also important is that the increase in operational expenditure is well balanced by self-restraint in administration. It has rightly been mentioned already that this is less than 6% of the budget, but the institutions are nonetheless making every effort to restrain administrative expenditure in the European Union. This time, it is lower than in the draft budget, although we have to plan to welcome Croatia also into our family of 27 – increasing to 28 – nations. I have to congratulate Ms Balzani for her part of the report on the choice of priorities, and Mr Fernandes on his part of the report on this self-restraint action on administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to cover needs, we need to use the flexibility instrument that was agreed between Parliament and the Council. This timely agreement could not have happened without the constructive role of the Polish Presidency, and personally of Minister Dominik, so my thanks to him, because this has also given a positive signal to the beneficiaries of the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has already been expressed on so many occasions, the level of payments might not be enough. I have to say this once more. I have to repeat that, in contrast to national annual budgets, the European budget is about investment. I know what the overall share of investment is in the budget for 2012 of the country I know best, which has been reduced to below 5% I think. More than 50 or 60% of the European budget should be classified as clearly being investment expenditure, covering the deficit of investment in the European Union with a multiplier effect on jobs and growth. If we have less for 2012 in real terms than for 2011, there will be some problems for the future as we are today also running short of payments, as is reflected in amending budget No 6. We have to reflect on the procedure of annual budgeting at the end of a financial perspective in terms of an increase in payments. That is normal and is no surprise.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the previous discussion, your rapporteur in Parliament said to President Draghi: ‘in the Central Bank we trust’. I personally trust in the joint declaration and in its credibility if there is a need for additional payments for 2012. I trust also that we have delivered all the necessary information to release the reserves. Once more, congratulations and thanks to everyone involved, including Alain Lamassoure, for reaching a timely agreement for 2012.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I take the liberty, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of thanking the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, as well as Commissioner Lewandowski, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dominik, and all my fellow Members, for the excellent work done and for the spirit of cooperation shown. I believe that the agreement reached during the night of Friday 18 November, after almost 16 hours of negotiations, has produced a good result, especially given the serious economic crisis and the difficulties faced by the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as commitment appropriations are concerned, I am satisfied with the decision to use the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million for headings 1 and 4, as Parliament had requested, in order to boost industrial competitiveness, finance priority policies, which are the essence of the Europe 2020 strategy, and tackle the difficult challenges in terms of neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear that Parliament’s priorities have been fulfilled for the other policies from the point of view of commitment appropriations. However, it is also true that, as many MEPs have emphasised in the speeches before this one, and as the rapporteurs themselves have stressed, the agreement cannot be said to be as satisfactory where payment appropriations are concerned, not least because the gap between commitments and payments has widened, which will increase the amount of liabilities to be paid, and because of the difficulties that the Commission may encounter in financing certain programmes that are due to expire.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, however, that today’s vote in Parliament, like the one yesterday in the Council, will serve to ratify a strict and responsible budget that takes full account of the crisis but that, at the same time, seeks to boost investment and the economy in order to achieve the aim of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my thanks to the Commission, the Polish Presidency and, in particular, to our own rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Following lengthy negotiations, we reached a compromise, and our group will support the compromise, as we have managed to get a large number of Parliament’s priorities included: research and development, lifelong learning and neighbourhood policy, in particular, with regard to Palestine. I support the compromise, but the negotiations also give cause for a great deal of concern for the future and have resulted in a lot of criticism within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We find it worrying that most of the negotiations were devoted to resolving conflicts within the Council, where a minority coalition of wealthier net contributors, including Sweden, are playing an increasingly negative role. They seem to be prepared to block an offensive policy for the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am convinced that the EU’s budget needs to be strengthened in certain crucial areas if we are to be able to make a positive contribution to recovery, growth and employment, particularly in those Member States where the need is greatest. We must also improve our implementation of what has been promised in the budget. We therefore need to focus on implementation, payments and at least paying our accounts on time.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With the extremely negative attitude of certain Member States towards the EU’s role, we run the risk in future negotiations on the long-term budget of ending up in the worst situation imaginable where certain Member States wish to safeguard agricultural policy and refuse to amend it while others refuse to increase the budget. The risk is that we will not get new resources for what is really needed: research and development, infrastructure and energy and climate initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In view of the fact that the Commission, a broad majority of Parliament and the majority of the Member States agree on these needs, I hope that the Polish Presidency and the forthcoming Danish Presidency will actually be able to persuade the blocking minority to consider their responsibility and adopt a more constructive position.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating and thanking our two rapporteurs on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and also by thanking the Council and the Commission for their excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our group will also support the compromise that we are to vote on today. It feels positive to be able to say this in view of the fact that, when we previously voted on our negotiating mandate in the autumn, we abstained because, at that time, we believed that we were trying to increase the budget by too much. In the current economic climate, a 5% increase in the budget quite simply would not be justified. Now the budget is increasing by just under 2%, which is a reasonable figure in the economic situation in which we find ourselves right now.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another positive aspect is that we actually succeeded in shifting the expenditure to measures oriented towards the future, namely those already mentioned by Mr Färm, such as research and development, lifelong learning and so on. At the same time, in our external relations, we can also focus on what has happened in North Africa in what has been referred to as the Arab Spring. This requires Europe’s attention, not only in the form of policies, but also in the form of funding. All of this is positive, and it means that we can, in fact, happily vote in favour of this budget today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What causes us a certain amount of concern for the future, however, is the fact that, as has already been said, within the Council, there are those who believe that we do not need to fulfil the agreements that we have entered into. However, we have to pay for what we have already agreed. This is something that cannot be repeated. Last year, we almost failed to reach an agreement on the budget at all. We reached an agreement this year, and that was probably necessary in the current economic climate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Given the mood in the Council, there may well be a great deal of resistance in this context in future, and therefore there is probably reason for certain Member States in the Council to consider just what it is they have agreed on in order to avoid future budget crises in the EU – something that we really do not need with all of these other economic problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Parliament seems reluctantly to have accepted a 2012 budget with an increase below 2%, effectively less than 2011 in real terms, but what an opportunity has been missed for Parliament to show that it is in the real world and getting to grips with economic reality. Do we honestly think that funds have been well spent in the past by the European Union or that they will be well spent in the future? Across Europe, governments are having to cut their budgets to overcome massive deficits while desperately trying to induce economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, the European Union’s appetite just seems to grow. This budget should have seen major substantive cuts, with funds returned to the treasuries of our countries. All the EU’s efforts should be focused on economic growth, on competition, and indeed on areas such as research and development. Instead, over the years, it has accrued more and more areas of competence where frankly it has no business. There are whole swathes of activity that the European Union could cut. We could have set an example with Parliament’s own budget, admittedly only a small part of the overall budget but nevertheless significant, costing some EUR 1.6 billion a year. New Direction, the think-tank, has identified cuts that could easily have been made – a quarter of the budget could be cut, some EUR 400 million could be saved by this Parliament without affecting the core roles of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The driving force in Parliament’s costs has been the massive inflation of Parliament’s bureaucracy, out of all proportion to the number of MEPs. Parliament owns or rents some 62 buildings. We see no way at the moment in which they seem to be cutting back. It is time for the European Union to end excess.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Lamassoure, ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2012 is an austerity budget with increases below the rate of inflation. The political question that we need to ask ourselves and to find an answer to is whether this represents a correct, forward-looking, pro-European decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">From a green perspective, the EU budget and the national budgets should be setting new priorities. We must remove the non-sustainable policies, in particular, at a European level in the areas of agricultural and Structural Funds. We need to put in their place sustainable policies that will promote competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">A dramatic figure has been quoted for 2010 which is that global CO2 emissions have increased by 6%. That is not a policy which we can continue if we want to save our planet. From our perspective, the European budget is not doing enough in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are living in times of austerity and I would like to emphasise that I know what I am talking about, because I come from Bremen, the smallest German state, and we have been forced to make savings for years. I do not live on the moon and I am not an alien who has landed in Brussels. I understand the suffering in the Member States, but their budgets have all risen in recent years, while the European budget has seen much smaller increases. However, we have to put this in proportion. Therefore, I believe that there is justification for saying that it is right that the small European budget, which amounts to only 1% of the GDP of the Member States, must be increased in specific policy areas, because this is all about spending for the future and about new competitiveness which is so badly needed in many European Member States. The European budget must implement a clear policy in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the positive aspects of this budget from a green perspective? There is funding of EUR 25 million for the new financial supervisory bodies which are urgently needed to enable us to regulate the financial markets more effectively. There are important pilot projects for innovation and also for the sustainable financing of online cultural markets. In our own administrative budget for Parliament, there is also the intention to make structural savings, including a reduction of EUR 20 million in spending on translation and interpreting and cuts in travelling costs. These are clear signs that the Members of this House are prepared to impose their own restrictions on the budget. I believe that this also sends an important signal to the public, to the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen and, in particular, the representative of the Council, whether this is a budget that really takes European added value and our common European interests seriously. I cannot see that this is the case. In the light of our major challenge – the conference in Durban is taking place at the moment – as Mr Lewandowski has once again said, the European budget should look quite different. It is, above all, an investment budget. Despite the need for austerity, we must use this budget to create new targeted incentives for new sustainable products, technologies and jobs to enable us to be more successful in the internal market and also on the global market. Only when Europe takes the lead with products of this kind will we have a chance of being competitive with emerging economies such as China and India. We need to do more. I think that a sense of common European determination is lacking in this budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where do I believe that the European Council is being inconsistent? It has constantly called for savings to be made. However, when it comes to the nuclear fusion reactor for which fission products such as tritium are needed, if indeed it ever functions properly, we will be spending EUR 1.3 billion more over the next two years. I would like to ask you whether you think this is consistent. If we really want to make savings, we should focus on future expenditure, in particular, in the area of research policy, where we know that we will be successful over the next few years. In the case of the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, this is completely uncertain. Therefore, it is wrong to take funding from the research framework programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, I believe that there is a problem with regard to interinstitutional trust. The Council made the statement that the commitment appropriations that we enter into should really be paid. Now this is no longer quite so clear. Therefore, my group is unable to vote in favour of this budget.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the draft 2012 budget will not meet requirements. My opinion differs from that of Commissioner Lewandowski. In terms of research, environmental sustainability, territorial cohesion and social solidarity, this budget does not have the muscle to either compensate for or correct the national austerity policies being followed throughout Europe. This is a budget that does not acknowledge Europe’s slide back into recession, unemployment and widespread insecurity amongst the younger generations. A budget below 1% of gross domestic product, and lower than that for 2011 in real terms, is a minimal budget for a minimal Europe. It is business as usual. So as to water down the evidence of this, the proposal has decided to increase or augment the divergence between commitments and payments; in other words, it is covering up a bad budget with bad budgetary practice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The alternative would have been to set out more clearly the priorities for negative investment that would free up resources for positive investment. In this budget, however, spending on security and military research is increased, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is strengthened, funding for big multinationals is increased, and export subsidies that are ruinous for developing countries are retained.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude by saying that we have been overcome by schizophrenia: we all talk about more and better Europe, but, in the end, we always choose less Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, despite much criticism, the 2012 budget is an austerity budget. This is a good sign for our citizens. It shows that the European Parliament is proposing an appropriate budget for these difficult economic times. To remind you, firstly, 94% of the EU budget goes to our citizens. Secondly, 6% funds the work of the EU institutions and, thirdly, the EU budget for 2012 represents an increase of 1.86% over this year and amounts to 0.98% of the GNI of the EU. This more than meets the demands of some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite all the austerity measures, we must not forget that this period of crisis must be followed by a future. However, with 20% youth unemployment, this promises to be extremely difficult for subsequent generations. Therefore, despite all the financial constraints, we must invest more, both in education and in creating sustainable jobs, so that we do not slide further into the crisis. For example, Greece has a great deal of potential. We can invest in solar power plants there which will not only create sustainable jobs, but will also help us to achieve our climate goals if we can transfer the electricity to our part of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, it has been a difficult year for both Francesca Balzani and José Manuel Fernandes. It has also been a difficult year for the parliamentary Delegation to the Budget Conciliation Committee, led by Alain Lamassoure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency-in-Office of the Council may be happy, and with reason: it saved its own match point in the tennis game that the 2012 budget negotiations turned into, particularly during conciliation night, with the inclusion of amending budget No 6/2011 and the financial implications of the ITER project.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I do not see many other reasons to be pleased. The unwritten rules of budget negotiation have been changed for the second time. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, a level was set for commitment appropriations in the budget conciliation, and then we negotiated the necessary payment appropriations. Now, the Council unilaterally sets the level of the payment appropriations and the level of the commitment appropriations is negotiated afterwards. This undermines the European Commission’s estimates and presents Parliament with a fait accompli.</p>
      <p sl="es">On this occasion, Parliament will accept this because of the economic emergency we are experiencing, which makes agreement essential, even if the agreement is a poor one. However, Mr Dominik, this way of negotiating does not bode well at all for the forthcoming negotiations on the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like other colleagues, I also want to thank the two rapporteurs for the tremendous job they have done in putting this budget together. I first of all want to say a few words on the general budget, before going on to the European Parliament’s budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the general budget, I would say that I support the agreement which we reached at conciliation, but also that I have some concerns. I am particularly concerned that in conciliation, we reached an agreement on the budget which does not allow enough funds to go to Structural Funds in the future, and that this will have particular implications for regions and countries across the European Union such as Wales.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Wales, we benefit greatly from Structural Funds, and if there is not enough money for Structural Funds in 2012, the blame will lie with the Council. The Council should understand and recognise that Structural Funds are an important part of creating jobs and growth in the European Union and if we do not have enough money to fund those Structural Funds, the Council, as I said, should accept the blame.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the European Parliament’s budget, which is perhaps my main responsibility, I believe Parliament has done its bit in terms of the budget. Parliament has accepted savings of around EUR 74 million – savings in interpretation, translation, etc. Importantly, Members of this Parliament have accepted savings as well, in terms of accepting a freeze in the office allowance and a cut in the travel budget. I believe, in future, we can do even more to make further savings.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me, the important message of this budget is that this Parliament recognises our priorities. We recognise that our priorities should be in putting money into jobs and growth – things like Structural Funds – while, at the same time, making savings where we possibly can.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it was not at all easy to reach agreement over the proposed budget this year, and we know that the resulting compromise was adopted in the Council by a slim majority. The total expenditure of just over EUR 129 billion represents a rise of 1.86% and, in my opinion, reflects the consolidated efforts of Member States at national level and the reality of the economic situation facing the continent of Europe today. Put simply, European expenditure during this crisis period has been kept under a tight rein, and below the expected level of inflation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">For me personally, as the coordinator for my group in the Committee on Regional Development, the main priority in deciding on the 2012 budget was, is and continues to be the provision of sufficient resources for cohesion, in other words, for Heading 1b, in order to comply with all of the commitments from previous years. It is therefore vital for us that the budget agreement includes a strong shared determination regarding the payments under item 3.1, securing sufficient funding for the area of cohesion policy, in case of need.</p>

The customary ritual will be followed: self-professed pro-Europeans of various stripes, who beat their chests in here when talking about the importance of a robust budget in the service of growth and development, are preparing to vote – without blushing – for this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This final proposal is below 1% of EU gross domestic product and will represent a decrease in the EU budget in real terms compared with last year. At the same time as they are tightening the noose of instruments like the Stability and Growth Pact and are freezing or even deepening the inequalities between the Member States, they are reducing to almost nothing the redistributive function of the budget, which would play a key role in reducing these inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All this is greatly exacerbated by intervention in the countries suffering the programmes of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. More so than the dead letters in the Treaties, the much-vaunted cohesion is increasingly a big lie.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, please note that, a fortnight ago, a Chinese investor said that the problems occurring in European countries were entirely the product of a society in its death throes, built on socialist ideals. These encourage laziness rather than hard work. The system of incentives has gone totally off the rails.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The problem with the 2012 EU budget is, indeed, the socialist demand, made by the European Parliament and the Commission, that more and more money be spent when this is simply not possible. Social democracy is working to protect its own interests and that has led to totally irresponsible behaviour. This is reflected in the 2012 budget. This budget, which has been increased again, will only create more jobs for the established euro clique, which has divided the pie up between its members. Our citizens have ended up with nothing. No value has been added: on the contrary. The 2012 budget will not resolve our problems, it will make them worse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The only solution which Europe really needs is to cut back on pointless things and focus on those things that directly contribute to the recovery of jobs, so that our citizens can earn their living honestly and meet the needs of their families. Yet, the EU will achieve none of that with the 2012 budget. The EU is failing and contributing to its own decline.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first good news here is that there is an agreement between the Council and Parliament. This will allow the EU to continue to be functional in the upcoming year as well. Furthermore, as a Hungarian, I can say that the lines that are most important to us remained essentially untouched as compared to the Commission’s original proposal. The functioning of agricultural policy has been ensured. In the convergence line, there is an almost nine per cent increase. We could argue whether this is much or little, but at any rate, it is more or less realistic.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are smaller items for us to be happy about, such as the EUR 9 million increase in funds that can be spent on school milk, a very successful programme. Moreover, we can also be happy about things that do not require any money, or at least no additional money, such as the adoption of the proposal to allocate resources to the conservation, maintenance and development of endangered languages under cultural funds.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Naturally, there are negative aspects as well. There is our debate with the Council about whether the entire European budget can be involved, or needs to be involved, in the process of resolving the crisis. We believe that there is much, much more that could be done in this regard. Still, if I were to weigh the positive and negative aspects against each other I would not even use the metaphor of the glass that is half empty or half full. Our glass is a good 80% full, and the remaining 20% require further efforts over the coming years. I hope that we will be able to achieve this similar to how we were able to achieve the progress made so far. The Group of the European People’s Party will obviously endorse this budget.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think that at times, when we get heavily involved in a discussion and really get down to detail, we can lose sight of the bigger picture to some degree. That is why I would like to remind those of you ladies and gentlemen who are so strongly criticising the outcome of this negotiation that the degree of similarity between the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s proposals could be more than 95%. I think, if we look at the outcome of the negotiation from the perspective of the commitments, the result is not too bad.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have strengthened programmes that will enable us to tackle the crisis: entrepreneurial initiative and innovation programmes, the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme, and programmes such as Erasmus Mundus. We have also committed money that will help our neighbours to the south of the Mediterranean look to a democratic future.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, one cannot deny that happiness is never absolute. For the past three years, the Council has had just one word on its mind: austerity. You are incapable of seeing beyond it. Parliament has not been convinced by austerity as a principle, and the results of the austerity policies on the European economy, subjected to all kinds of pressure, have not helped to change our minds.</p>
      <p sl="es">Yet the Council continues to focus only on austerity, and it has taken a further potentially dangerous step. Limiting payment appropriations as far as possible is one thing, but failing to fulfil accepted obligations, which is what is happening now, is something else altogether. This is neither rigour nor austerity. What you are doing is failing to comply with your accepted commitments.</p>

      <p sl="da">Nevertheless, I do have one concern about the result that we have achieved and that concerns Amendment No 6. I think we will find ourselves in an extremely intolerable situation if we have the Council/Member States, on the one hand, promising to come up with extra funds if there should be a need for them, saying that they will ensure that the EU can pay its bills, but then, when the Commission approaches them and needs more money to be able to pay the bills, several countries say that they do not believe that the Commission’s figures are correct – without even providing a description of the correct figures. In my view, that is a completely intolerable situation. Of course we must pay our bills. Mr Lewandowski mentioned that 50-60% of the EU’s budget is an investment budget and that, at the start of the period, the bills that need to be paid are not so large, but that they are large at the end of the period, and right now we are at the end of the seven-year programming period.</p>

I am glad that we have managed to agree on the amending budget as well, but it can be seen that the problems which have come to light in this budget will recur; what is more, they will accumulate. Why is this? In my view, it results from people’s expectations of the European Union, its ambitions and plans, the launching of new policies and new measures, such as common diplomacy, its ever-greater involvement in policy related to humanitarian operations, its pursuit of ambitious structural measures, its activities in the field of research – the list could go on forever. All of these ambitions, measures and expectations are not accompanied by any desire on the part of the Member States to finance them. This is a problem which not only will not disappear, but will intensify, because we are committing ourselves to more and more measures, and yet there are no payments to go with them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that the openness and dialogue we have seen during the conciliation procedure will accompany us as we resolve the problem of payments I have been discussing.

      <p sl="fr">The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority.</p>

We must also be pleased that there is a budget and that we have reached agreement on it. During the current crisis, I believe that having a budgetary crisis as well was not helpful. We only reached this situation thanks to the prudent actions of Parliament, which could have blocked the whole process. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same degree of prudence in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have gone through the budgetary procedure twice so far, as stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon. The exact same scenario has taken place every time: the Council imposed the figures for payments and did not agree to any kind of negotiation, which is not normal at all. I do not believe that this procedure of stating the figures and then making the allocations in the European policies is the normal procedure. In my view, we should do the reverse: we should see what the requirements are first, then calculate the budget.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Council has issued a statement each time, committing itself to accept budget amendments where the amounts required for payments cannot be achieved. It has not kept its word: just look at what happened with Amendment No 6 to the budget. I do not know whether it will do this next year. We cannot carry on like this, not having confidence in the figures presented by the Commission. There are two procedures of paramount importance coming up next year: the 2013 budget and the multiannual financial framework (MFF).

      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, for the second year running, the European Parliament has accepted the Council’s reading on increasing payments by less than 2% this year, which means less than in 2011 in real terms. We have repeatedly said that this decision is at odds with the Commission’s estimates, which identified far higher payment requirements for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, we have obtained the commitment appropriations that we wanted in almost all areas, but nevertheless, we cannot constantly amend the budget and top it up during the financial year as needs are identified. This is a piecemeal approach that will prevent the European Union from setting broad guidelines, particularly in terms of research, as demonstrated by the ITER case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me simply remind you that the EU budget is still a lever and that, despite the current austerity policies in Member States – which we fully understand – we do also need to make some minimum commitments.

      <p sl="it">The outcome of the negotiations can be described as positive as far as the priorities established by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are concerned.

A 1.86% increase in payment appropriations over the 2011 figure goes against the economic recovery line that the Commission proposed and which this Parliament very much wanted. Focusing on priorities at a time of austerity is surely a winning strategy, but what transpires from the conciliation is a worrying disparity between the commitments made and the appropriations actually granted.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, this result is liable to undermine public confidence in the possibility of our getting through this period of serious economic and social difficulty together, at European level, and within an acceptable time frame.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, I would like to congratulate everyone on drawing up this budget, which is a good model for the Member States to follow. In the case of payments, we should always make a comparison with the average payments made by the Member States. With regard to commitments, we should call on the Member States not to exceed the upper limits which we impose on ourselves. It should also be possible to introduce an automatic mechanism into the negotiations to ensure that the restrictions on getting too heavily into debt which we apply to ourselves at a European level are supported voluntarily by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would specifically like to thank the Commission for allowing Ms Kroes to take over responsibility for the Erasmus for Journalists programme which we introduced last year as a preparatory action. In the context of this programme, journalists can acquire a new understanding in the different capital cities and in many other areas of the European Union of how European policy is implemented by the Member States and by the television companies, the newspapers and the social networks. This is an important opportunity for us to bring journalists closer to the real Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also pleased that there is further support for the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme. This will generate new jobs and new employment opportunities. The implementation of the programme, which helps entrepreneurs to make contact with suppliers and customers, will establish networks that will benefit all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the Commission for promising to support the Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck. It is very important for us all that people are brought together across national boundaries, particularly in the field of sport where achievement is the central factor.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I welcome this agreement on next year’s budget. Since there is an economic recession, it is fitting that we accept this agreement because we cannot seek too large an increase for next year, and probably for the next couple of years.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I would like to focus on two things: sea and sport.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regarding the sea, I welcome very much the new budget line for maritime actions and particularly the proposals made by Commissioner Damanaki just a few days ago regarding the Atlantic. I think the potential for developing new jobs and growth by exploiting the resources of the sea is immense, especially in terms of renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In the Atlantic in particular, we probably have the best resources in terms of offshore wind, tidal and wave power and we need to exploit them. Undersea mining could also solve many of our difficulties regarding raw materials and, of course, offshore aquaculture is a tremendous opportunity to offset the destocking of the fish resources in the sea and guarantee healthy fish from our own waters, rather than importing them from dubious sources.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regarding sport – and my colleague Mr Rübig mentioned many points which I agree with – one thing I would like to see in particular is an Erasmus for sport because I think there is huge potential there. We do not give enough value to the potential of sport in solving economic difficulties, and particularly health difficulties. Every day I attend hearings here with people coming looking for more and more money to do research to find cures for various health problems. The cure is very simple: prevention. That can start by having people lead active lives, healthy lives, starting at a young age.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, to begin with, I, too, would like to offer my congratulations, since reaching a compromise on the 2012 budget is undoubtedly a success, although there are still some failings, because the increase amounts to less than the inflation expected by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to highlight the part played by the Polish Presidency in reaching the compromise between the European Commission’s proposal, the European Parliament’s position and the Member States’ expectations. I would like to emphasise how happy I am that the cuts, although very stringent, did not extend to cohesion policy, which is the most development-friendly of all European policies and which promotes the maintenance of a necessary level of investment in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">With such a difficult budget, it is necessary to search for reserves where European funds are spent inefficiently, and to release their full potential for growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I also agree with the many remarks that have been made concerning how our 2012 budget should be improved. For my part, I should say that the increase in commitment appropriations and payment appropriations proposed by the Council is too large. A more balanced overall budget level would be much more acceptable. There are reserves in administrative expenditure and in other regulations. Secondly, in my view, the Council’s proposal to increase budgeted expenditure under various headings at the expense of the reserves relating to those headings does not merit support. It is essential to determine an adequate level of reserves in the European Union budget; this especially concerns the headings relating to external relations and administrative expenses.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the compromise reached in conciliation is fairly satisfactory: there has been an increase in the funds to support small and medium-sized enterprises and a legitimate increase, also, in the package for FRONTEX, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time of obvious difficulty, one could not have asked for more. Indeed, I would have even preferred it if more cuts had been made to certain budget items that I do not consider essential: I am referring, for example, to the increase in the funds for cooperation with Asia and Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I think that the additional increase in the appropriations to support the Turkish Cypriot community is an outrage: I do not believe that the European Union should legitimise a population that is illegally occupying territory that does not belong to it. In any case, the increase has not placed a particularly heavy burden on the Member States, which have already been severely tested by the crisis, and this was undoubtedly the most important thing to ensure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are discussing the very modest budget for 2012, below 1% of EU GNI, despite growing responsibilities under the Lisbon Treaty and despite growing challenges which deserve a common answer. Although this budget is nominally growing, it is not growing in real terms – in real terms, it is decreasing. And we are not asking on behalf of the Commission or on behalf of Parliament; here we are starting savings. 94% of what we are asking for is for the operational expenditure of a different nature from that which is in the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I have to respond to some speakers who notoriously accuse us of growing while others are making cuts. This is simply not true; this is true of only about four countries, which are easy to guess – Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which are decreasing. The other national budgets of the European Union are growing, including the UK and the Dutch budgets. Despite all the savings, we have some obligations to make payments from the European budget. This is all the same, with the big difference that the European budget is always in equilibrium and cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of fiscal policy at the national level. This is mainly about investment, as clearly explained, for example, by Anne Jensen or Mr Vaughan from Wales, in the name of the stakeholders of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry to repeat this on so many occasions but some Members of the Parliament have the habit of making a critical point and leaving before they receive the answer.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, of course we can hold a long debate on the level of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, and there will always be some people who are unhappy. This is also the case with national budgets; there are always some people who are unhappy, because funds for their particular priority have not been provided to the level they would have hoped. Yet let us not forget that we face a very difficult economic situation in the European Union, and extremely serious problems in the Member States in terms of finding extra money. As I see it, however, there are two very important messages which came out of this year’s budgetary procedure, and which I think are worth emphasising at this point and keeping in mind.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, this year’s budgetary procedure confirmed that we can still talk about and resolve very difficult issues in the European Union using only the Community method. This is a very important message. In order to reach an agreement, we followed exactly the procedure provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There was no need for any other extra-institutional measures. This is the kind of achievement we should be aiming for at the moment. We have set an example to the whole of the European Union, proving that the Community method still works.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second very important message is that despite the criticism levelled at amending budget No 6 to this year’s budget, its adoption proves that the commitments undertaken by Parliament and the Council in the course of the budgetary procedure are respected. We can continue the discussion on whether to accept these 200 million or not. All those who participated in the conciliation procedure will remember that the discussion hinged on whether 200 million is, in fact, the amount needed or not, and whether at this time, while the decision is being taken, we can be sure that the budget needs exactly this specific amount and not some other amount, whether greater or smaller. That is what the discussion was about: not whether to provide the money, but how much money should be provided.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, these are two very important messages to be taken from this budgetary procedure, and we should remember them. At present, we are succeeding in implementing the EU’s provisions, the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and this is what we should focus on. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is good news that this year, the three institutions of the European Union came to an agreement regarding the 2012 budget in time. Due to the crisis, there will be only a slight increase in payments, but I consider it important to review this decision over the next year if necessary, and remind the Member States of the promises they made.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It would be unacceptable for the lack of funds to hit hardest those who are in the most dire need. It is the very programmes under the European Social Fund that support the fight against unemployment and social cohesion which are most endangered by the depletion of funds. Governments must therefore be held accountable for adhering strictly to the Member State commitments made in order to make up for the lack of funds. At the same time, Parliament has managed to negotiate an increase in the level of longer-term financial commitments, and EU funds will therefore hopefully contribute to kick-starting the European economy and achieving our strategic goals for the period until 2020.</p>
      <p sl="hu">‘The establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice has been elevated to a matter of Community competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, and requires more funding’, explained Kinga Göncz, Socialist shadow rapporteur for the 2012 budget on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="hu">An appropriate response to the challenges of security and migration can only be given at European level. Parliament was able to negotiate even more support than proposed by the European Commission as regards commitments for purposes serving the security of citizens and a more open Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument highlights once more the crucial need for the EU budget to be increasingly flexible. At the same time, despite contained reinforcements in commitments on a limited number of budget items and several decreases in other budget items, the ceilings of subheading 1a and Heading 4 do not allow for adequate financing of selected priorities carried by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, for the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2012, the flexibility instrument shall be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 30.75 million in commitment appropriations under subheading 1a and of EUR 208.67 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 4. The mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to finance the Europe 2020 strategy will therefore require a total amount of EUR 239.42 million.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wonder where it comes from, this idea that the way to get rich is by receiving subsidies? It is not true of individuals and it is not true of nations. If it were true, Greece would now be the wealthiest country in the EU, and there would be angry, impoverished, penurious German crowds protesting about the bail-out that they were getting from Athens.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, of course, as we have seen in the European Union, the reverse is true; the effect of receiving large subsidies is in fact deleterious to your GDP. The reason for that is that among states, as among individuals, people will eventually begin to arrange their affairs around qualifying for the hand out. Just as within a nation, welfare can be debilitating to the recipient, so among nations, the same principle pertains. Excessive intervention at EU level, excessive spending, was the cause of our problem. It is not going to be the solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we approved the EU budget for 2012, agreeing to an increase in spending of 2% and this actually represented a victory for Member States and taxpayers over this Parliament and the Commission. Hard though it is to believe, the Commission called for an increase of 4.3% and the Parliament wanted an increase of 5.3% – this at a time when national governments are having to increase taxes and cut expenditure at home.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could there be any better illustration of how detached both the Commission and this Parliament have become from the real world? In my view, even a 2% increase is too high; we should cut the EU budget and save our taxpayers’ money. Rather than asking for increases in funds, the Commission should concentrate on spending wisely the money it already receives.</p>

I welcome the deal which has been found between the Council and Parliament for next year’s budget which now reflects the reality of tough budgetary decisions being taken at national level right across Europe. The European Union has the responsibility to share the burden of the economic crisis and take part in the joint effort towards budget austerity and responsible spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, I support the 2% overall increase decided today, which is way below the original budget bid of 5% by the Commission and 5% by Parliament. It was the right thing to do.

      <p sl="de">The other news, which is to say the bad news – and I, personally, am really peeved by this – is that the Member States have more and more new duties for the European Parliament and constantly pass on new functions to us, but then, when it comes to funding, the necessary funds are not handed over along with the responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">That will be our task for the future – there needs to be a fair negotiation, a fair deal. Additional duties for the European Parliament clearly also mean additional funding, additional financial resources. It is for that reason that I abstained from voting on this motion.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 15 hours of constructive negotiations, the 2012 budget has been finalised with an agreed level of payment appropriations of EUR 129.08 billion, corresponding to the amount agreed by the Council in its July position. In contrast, the amount of commitment appropriations stands at EUR 147.23 billion, which is almost EUR 1 billion more than the sum in the Council’s position.</p>
      <p sl="it">When it became clear, during the negotiations, that there would be no room to negotiate on payment appropriations, given that the Member States’ delegations had illustrated the difficulties facing national budgets, the European Parliament’s approach was to focus on the level of commitments, with particular reference to competitiveness and external relations. I therefore support this 2012 budget; considering the difficult economic and financial period we are in, it has still found a far-reaching solution under the heading of competitiveness, for example, by regarding innovation and investment as being conducive to a future European recovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to conclude by pointing out that, for the first time since the introduction of the new procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon, an agreement has been reached by the conciliation deadline.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, since 2010, we have been experiencing a sovereign debt crisis, particularly in the euro area, of a kind not seen before in our recent past, and it is highlighting the weaknesses of European instruments in fighting against speculation by the so-called ‘markets’.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of the instruments at our disposal in the euro area is the European Central Bank. In my view, its political will to get the debt crisis under control and focus on growth has been sorely lacking. Firstly, in relation to growth, it has decided, unlike other central banks, not to lower interest rates, which would encourage consumption and investment and boost these within the scope of its powers. Secondly, in relation to sovereign debt, it has only acted in the secondary markets at crunch times, without being able to mobilise and use all its resources to combat speculation and help to protect our single currency, acting as a bank of last resort, yes, but not quickly or decisively enough.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are the reasons for the way we intend to vote on this report, and also for our demands about the future role of the European Central Bank.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report submitted to us today by the European Central Bank (ECB) contains information that I find deeply interesting. In 2010, the ECB earned a surplus of EUR 1 334 million; a fall compared to the previous period. Factors contributing to this fall were, firstly, the lower net interest income as a result of lower interest rates both on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations and on US dollar-denominated official foreign reserves and, secondly, the fact that no gold sales took place in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 31 December 2010, an amount of EUR 1 163 million to the risk provision, thereby increasing it to the level of its present ceiling. As a result, the ECB’s declared net profit for 2010 amounted to EUR 171 million, which the Governing Council decided to distribute in its entirety to the euro area national central banks.</p>
      <p sl="it">The purpose of the risk provision is to cover foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The size of, and the continuing requirement for, this provision are reviewed annually.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ECB’s regular income derives from investment earnings on its foreign reserve assets and its own funds portfolio, from interest income on its 8% share of the total euro banknotes in circulation, and from net interest income arising from securities purchased for monetary policy purposes under the covered bond purchase programme and the Securities Markets Programme.</p>

This report would enable the Council to take far-reaching decisions on development policy in 10 important African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states on its own. There is neither a political nor a legal basis for denying Parliament the right to codecision in the procedure concerning the delegated acts on development policy. On the contrary, in fact, Parliament, as representative of the people, should pay particular heed to its competences so that it can help decide the conditions on which, and the purposes for which, taxpayers’ money is used in the field of development policy. In a declaration of intent for the post-2013 period, the Council agreed to give due consideration to the delegated acts. I consider that to be a disregarding of Parliament’s rights.

      <p sl="it">This difference of opinion has meant that the Conciliation Committee has had to be convened together with a trialogue, which has led to four compromise proposals being drafted.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Union is based on values such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law.

The new legal framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has the potential to improve the effectiveness and transparency of Community external assistance worldwide. We must bear in mind the fact that the directly elected European Parliament is the bearer of democratic legitimacy within the institutional framework, and it is therefore becoming an issue of principle to strengthen the position of Parliament through the use of delegated acts in the area of external relations.</p>

      <p sl="it">While the success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the commitment made by the EU as a whole, the Member States must consider economic and budgetary policies as a matter of common interest. Some countries may be able to make faster progress on their own, but together we can all go further. We therefore need to become more coordinated when adopting and implementing budgetary measures and measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion effectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, promoting international commercial links and enhancing the internal market are elements that are crucial to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, the Europe 2020 strategy needs to have a broader regional and social dimension. Only by directly involving local bodies in the planning and implementation of programmes will it be possible to ensure greater awareness of the objectives to be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because the European Union needs to tackle macro-economic imbalances using a symmetrical approach. Member States’ economic policies need to be coordinated more closely, especially during a recession. However, a sense of responsibility and courage are needed from governments so that they apply the austerity measures required for economic recovery. Current disparities in terms of inflation rate and competitiveness must be corrected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must point out that, without adopting effective structural measures, Europe will only achieve an economic growth rate of roughly 1.5% by 2020. At the same time, national budgets must not jeopardise the whole EU’s financial stability, and harmonising the EU budget and Member States’ budgets is an absolute must. The Euro Plus Pact, which my country has also joined, will help improve the coordination of economic policies.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the effects of the economic crisis has been the increase in inequalities, macro-financial imbalances and disparities in terms of competitiveness. These problems have shown that the EU must address macro-economic imbalances on the basis of a symmetrical approach that tackles both excessive deficits and excessive surpluses, thereby ensuring closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies and better budgetary monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="it">The experience gained from the introduction of the euro and the mistakes made during the first 10 years of the functioning of economic and monetary union have highlighted the need for more effective economic governance of the EU, governance that should be based on greater national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework for monitoring national economic policies at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are in the middle of the most serious crisis of capitalism in Europe since the 1930s. The answer of the bosses and their representatives in governments across Europe is very clear. It is contained in the one word ‘austerity’. The problem that they face is that the majority of people across Europe do not agree with their solutions. The majority of people know that while the rich are getting richer, the economies of Europe are being destroyed and thrown into a downwards spiral.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we have this so-called ‘European Semester’ and ‘economic surveillance’. It is part of the process of doing away with that very awkward notion of democratic checks, democratic accountability, and replacing it with financial coups in Italy and in Greece and the use of colonial tactics where austerity budgets are imposed by the likes of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The meaning of this process was seen in relation to the Irish budget, where next week, we will have a discussion in the Dáil, the Irish Parliament, about a budget that will contain cutbacks of up to EUR 4 billion – savage attacks on ordinary people – but before any discussion in the Irish Parliament, before any discussion in Irish society, the outlines of this budget turned up in the German Bundestag. Despite the false outrage of the Irish Government, that is precisely what ‘economic surveillance’ means.</p>

      <p sl="it">As the statistics and a paragraph of the report on which we have voted show, there is a higher rate of infection among young men and women. A UN research project has found that, while the HIV information campaign was particularly high-profile in the 1980s, interest in this type of disease has gradually diminished, as if the danger has passed. As a result, young people today are less well informed and less aware of the risks associated with infection. Few know that a person living with HIV does not necessarily have AIDS, or that HIV is transmitted while AIDS is not, or that tests are carried out to diagnose HIV, but not AIDS.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, 33 million people are currently living with HIV, 2.5 million people are newly infected every year, and over two million people die of AIDS annually. According to Irish Aid, HIV/AIDS is likely to become the leading cause of death in the 21st century. These shocking figures underline the need for a real response to this disease and unfortunately, in some respects, we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">International financing for HIV programmes in the ex-colonial world has fallen by 10% in 2010. Even in Europe, as part of the massive cutbacks that are taking place in the public sector and in public services, cost-cutting measures have been introduced in relation to antiretroviral drugs, a move which, in reality, puts people’s lives at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important research has been conducted and important steps forward have been made in terms of increasing access to antiretroviral drugs with generic medicines and patent pills, but it is still not enough. The existence of patents that protect the pharmaceutical industry often means that those who need these drugs do not get access to them. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry needs to be nationalised and run democratically in the interest of people not profit, and this needs to be accompanied by a substantial increase in internationally coordinated patent-free research to guarantee progress and access to improved HIV/AIDS drugs for all.</p>

What I am opposed to is things creeping into such a report that, in fact, have nothing to do with the actual subject. I am referring here, for example, to recital 22, which calls – and I quote – for ‘safe and legal abortion’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well, the European Union should not be meddling in these kinds of matters. This is a matter for the Member States, and if there are Member States that want abortion to remain illegal, then that should be perfectly possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report rightly calls for respect for rights, including the right to privacy of those who have been infected, but it fails to address the question of how people who have to deal with those infected with the virus, such as doctors, dentists and nurses, can be protected if they are never made aware that one of their patients has been infected. This is a sensitive issue, but it is also a problem that urgently needs to be discussed. We should also be able to protect society at large.</p>

The interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework. For the 2012 budget, additional expenditure, beyond the ceilings of Headings 1a and 4 is required, and the Commission has proposed to mobilise the flexibility instrument in accordance with point 27 of the interinstitutional agreement. The amounts to be mobilised are as follows: EUR 30.75 million for the EU 2020 strategy under Heading 1a; EUR 208.67 million for the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument under Heading 4.

      <p sl="pt">Taking into account the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006, the European Commission is proposing to mobilise the flexibility instrument for Heading 1a of the 2012 EU budget, on competitiveness for growth and employment, and Heading 4, on the EU as a global player, since it is becoming essential to exceed the maximum limits for both headings.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The sums to be mobilised represent EUR 30.75 million for Europe 2020 strategy targets, and EUR 208.67 million for the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument. Both areas are extremely important to the EU, to differing degrees. Firstly, it is crucial to start taking the required measures and to allocate the necessary funding to transform the EU into a smart, inclusive and sustainable economy by reducing the unemployment rate, by increasing productivity, and by increasing social cohesion. To this end, there is a need to implement the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards EU foreign policy, following the revolutions of the Arab Spring, it is essential that the EU support processes of democratic transition in these countries and that it create, at the same time, the measures necessary for the economic and social development of the public, whose expectations are now extremely high.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in favour of the EU 2020 strategy and the European Neighbourhood Policy. Point 27 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management allows for the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework. I support the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for financing the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy under subheading 1a, and for financing the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument under Heading 4, for a total amount of EUR 239.42 million. Therefore, as part of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2012, the flexibility instrument will be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 30.75 million in commitment appropriations in Heading 1a and EUR 208.67 million in commitment appropriations in Heading 4. I urge, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, that the EU should attach greater importance to the Eastern Partnership and to cooperation with neighbouring EU Member States in the Danube region. The mobilisation of the flexibility instrument highlights the vital need for the EU budget to be increasingly flexible.</p>

On the other hand, we cannot support a budget in which there is no serious demonstration of the will to reprioritise and, what is more, where an increase in support for nuclear power has also been agreed.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution on the EU budget for 2012 and approved the joint text agreed by the Conciliation Committee at the negotiations in November. The overall level of payment appropriations in the 2012 budget is set at EUR 129.088 billion, with commitments set at EUR 147.232 billion. Taking into account the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in Member States, the Council and the European Parliament have agreed on a reduction in the level of payment appropriations for 2012 as compared to the Commission’s draft budget. However, the Commission will be able to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure under subheading 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment), subheading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment), Heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources), Heading 3 (Citizenship, freedom, security and justice) and Heading 4 (EU as a global player). I agree that the Europe 2020 strategy must be at the centre of the EU budgetary strategy for 2012 because these policies are vital and necessary parts of the EU strategy for economic recovery, and we must therefore ensure that they have adequate investment at both EU and national level.

      <p sl="fr">The draft 2012 budget contains some useful initiatives, such as the EUR 250 million allocated to fruit and vegetable producers, or the ‘Erasmus for all’ budget. It is a shame, however, that over the course of the negotiations, the small percentage increase in the budget that was provided for by both the Commission and Parliament in its October vote was lost. We are still a long way off devoting 1.24% of our GDPs to the EU budget. Naturally, the current climate calls more for reigning in than for increasing expenditure; however, I believe we cannot make do with a policy of austerity alone. We need to be proposing long-term plans for economic regeneration at the same time. The budget we have voted for today will not enable us to plan for economic, environmental and social regeneration. I abstained for this reason, but also because a sum of EUR 100 million (and this is merely the first in a long series) has been allocated to ITER. In my view, this research project should be conducted on a steady budget. Its budget has grown exponentially since it was launched, and from now on, ITER should be developed with the funds that are available.</p>

I think that in light of the Arab Spring, the EU needs to provide financial support to these countries in their efforts to rebuild and move towards democracy.

In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration.

The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.</p>

There was a need for a strategic strengthening to promote territorial and social cohesion within the Union, thereby relaunching public confidence in the European project.

The EUR 129.088 billion in payments will represent a decrease in the EU budget in real terms. What we have here, therefore, is a clear surrender to the impositions of the most powerful countries and the interests that they advocate, at the expense of the countries with weaker economies, passing on to the latter the economic and social costs of the policies that led to the crisis. These are policies and measures central to the European process of capitalist integration, and they have been reinforcing these rather than reversing them, as was necessary.

The EU budgets for individual years form part of the seven year financial framework, which estimates how much money will be needed for EU programmes. The European Parliament's proposal for the 2012 EU budget focuses on the need to respect existing commitments and to accelerate programmes that are coming to an end. The total budget for next year will be EUR 129.1 billion (a growth of 1.86%) in payments and EUR 147.2 billion in commitments. There will be a limited increase in funding for payments, as requested by Member States, which have accepted the European Parliament’s growth priorities, such as, for example, innovation, employment, border protection and migration management and supporting the development of democracy in the Arab world. The budget headings where Parliament is requesting more growth include research and development (+8.8%) and headings covering the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds (+10.35%).

      <p sl="lt">Today, we approved next year’s European Union budget. Reaching an agreement on the budget is always a challenge. This is particularly the case now that the European Parliament participates actively in negotiations on the establishment of the budget and, on the other hand, given that the European Union economy does not promise increased budgetary revenues next year at either national or EU level. In terms of figures, the EU budget is increasing. However, when we factor in annual inflation, we find ourselves in the same place. It is important not to reduce the amount of money earmarked for economic growth and research – this is the only way to boost the faltering EU economy. Even so, in future, the Member States themselves should also be interested in reducing administrative costs, above all, by cutting three European Parliament jobs.</p>

In order to meet commitments already made, the Commission estimates that the European Social Fund needs a further EUR 1.5 billion for 2011, while another EUR 142 million is required for research. The Commission has tabled amending budget No 6/2011 in order to tackle this need for EUR 1.642 billion by redeploying funds, so it remains within the margins of the budget. In Heading 1, EUR 697 million has been found, and EUR 395 million has been found in Heading 2, more specifically, in rural development. There is, therefore, a EUR 550 million shortfall.

This applies mainly to the balances for VAT and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as to traditional own resources. As far as the integrated maritime policy is concerned, it was funded for the first three years after its establishment in December 2007 via pilot projects and preparatory actions. In September 2010, the Commission submitted a draft regulation aimed at continuing its funding up to the end of the current financial framework. The proposed funding will enable the Commission to continue developing and determining the options for implementation of the integrated maritime policy, in accordance with the instructions set out in the progress report. The administrative reform in Greece is of fundamental significance for the successful implementation of cohesion policy through the Structural Funds. The aim of the administrative reform operational programme is to introduce reforms that will improve specific important operations of the Greek state, the functioning of the public administration and the efficiency of public services.

The proposed spending in key areas will also fail to ensure the sustainable transformation of the European economy.

      <p sl="pt">It is regrettable that the European Commission has not taken all the measures necessary to defend these jobs, as we advocated several times, by taking measures to put a stop to the veritable ‘nomad’ strategy of these multinationals. Once again, we would stress the injustice of the high rate of cofinancing – 35% of the full sum envisaged – demanded of the Member States under the EGF’s finance criteria, which makes applications by countries with weaker financial situations more difficult.</p>

On 6 June 2011, Portugal submitted Application EGF/2011/005 PT/Norte-Centro Automotive to mobilise the EGF in respect of redundancies in three enterprises operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (‘Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers’) in the NUTS II regions of Norte (PT11) and Centro (PT16) in Portugal.

The EGF, which aims to help workers who fall victim to the relocation of companies, is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has already been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Portugal, which has applied for assistance with regard to 726 redundancies, all of which have been targeted for assistance, at three companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (‘Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers’), in the NUTS II regions of Norte (PT11) and Centro (PT16).</p>

The application concerns the mobilisation from the EGF of a sum of EUR 1 518 465 for Portugal in the event of 726 redundancies in three companies manufacturing cars, trailers and semi-trailers. The redundancies were made in the period between 1 July 2010 and 1 April 2011 in two contiguous regions, Norte and Centro. The cause of these redundancies is the decline in demand for new cars in the European Union. Car production in the EU dropped by 17% in 2009 and by 23% in 2008, compared with the same period in 2007. The fall in demand for electrical equipment for cars, combined with the impossibility of reducing production costs further and/or having access to credit, resulted in the closure of the Lear production plant in Guarda and its relocation to Morocco.

As I see it, this is about as effective as sticking a plaster on a wooden leg. If we really want to help workers, we should not restrict ourselves to ‘globalisation adjustment’. It would be better if the money distributed by the EU were matched by lasting democratic practices within the companies, a ban on speculative redundancies and fairer distribution of the wealth created. It would be better if all Members of the European Parliament supported us when we call for job and training security, financed by public funds.

No person can be punished for a publicly expressed opinion if such a statement does not show any signs of criminality. Attention should be drawn to the fact that the immunity of an MEP is an institutional arrangement and guarantee of independence, offering protection from external pressure and ensuring the independence of MEPs in the performance of their duties. Moreover, parliamentary immunity is aimed at protecting both the institution of Parliament itself and its members as individuals.</p>

      <p sl="en">This proposal discusses amendments made to a Council regulation regarding repayable assistance and financial engineering. Member States have had great success with repayable assistance schemes from 2000 to 2006 and have now started implementing these repayable assistance schemes in the programming for 2007-2013. In July of 2006, Council Regulation No 1083/2006 gave the general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation 1260/1999. These provisions laid out the rules for financial assistance, but the repayable assistance plans in the form of reimbursement grants and credit lines that Member States adopted were not completely covered by the provisions of Regulation No 1083/2006. I thus agree with the rapporteur in that it is necessary in accordance with Article II of Council Regulation No 1081/2006 to make amendments that allow Structural Funds to cofinance repayable assistance. Such amendments need to include the following provisions: the financial resources used during repayable assistance must be reimbursed by beneficiaries, enhanced transparency and more efficient execution of financial engineering resources, and making clear that provisions on major projects are not applicable for repayable assistance.</p>

This is an interesting fact if we think that assistance to Member States has continued to take the form of non-repayable assistance over the years. In August 2011, the European Commission tabled a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 with regard to repayable assistance and financial engineering, clarifying the eligibility of partially repayable assistance and the definition of mandatory reporting obligations in the area of financial instruments. I agree and I believe this report is positive because I hope that, remaining with the repayable type of assistance, Member States will grant assistance to various entities, in order to be able to use the Structural Funds, more than once if necessary, throughout the programming period.</p>

      <p sl="it">The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report.</p>

With debilitated public finances, capacity for absorption of funds is reduced, so the reduction in the need for national cofinancing that has just been introduced will make a valuable contribution to improving the socio-economic and financial situations of these countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">During this period of economic and financial crisis, European solidarity is more relevant than ever. This solidarity is at the heart of cohesion policy, which grants aid to regions experiencing slow economic growth. At the moment, some Member States in receipt of EU Structural Fund support are no longer in a position to cofinance some of their development projects, due to liquidity problems. As I am in favour of a strong cohesion policy, I voted for a European Parliament resolution to temporarily increase the cofinancing level for certain projects by 10% (which, in some very specific cases, may raise this level to 95%). These projects will be targeted, and must meet the objectives of competitiveness, employment and growth.</p>

The European Commission proposal is aimed at providing additional financial resources to EU Member States facing particular difficulties in managing public debt/deficit and ensuring financial stability so that it is possible to continue implementing the programmes. A balanced compromise was reached in the negotiations with the Council on the retroactivity of the proposed measures, combined with a sunset clause, allowing all countries participating in the programme to make use of the increased cofinancing rate. This will also allow for swift action to help Member States hit hard by the crisis.

The persistence of the economic and financial crisis having an alarmingly negative impact on the macro-economic stability and budgets of Member States makes it necessary to take prompt action through the provision of additional financial resources to EU Member States in situations of particular difficulty, with a view to ensuring the continuation of the implementation of the programmes. The method chosen is that of a ten percentage points ‘top-up’ of the applicable cofinancing rates for the priority axes of the programmes, allowing for an increase in payments to the countries eligible. The proposed measures will be temporary, coming to an end when the Member State exits the financial assistance mechanism, but the regulation needs to be applied retroactively. I also agree with the rapporteur that the procedure of granting the top-up measures needs to be transparent, and for this purpose, that it would be useful to have appropriate reporting on the use of the increased interim payments, although this should not lead to an increase in the administrative burden.</p>

The revised regulation will therefore increase the sums allocated to the countries in question on a temporary, exceptional basis.

Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments.

I agree with the rapporteur’s conclusions. Indeed, this amendment to the general regulation will enable action to be taken quickly to assist Member States hit hard by the crisis. The temporary increase in the maximum cofinancing limits will enable funds to be focused on realising certain projects and will reduce the pressure on national budgets. In short, these measures will assist our countries in this crisis situation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The present crisis with which the Union is grappling has enabled the improvement of EU mechanisms for preventing systemic risk and for reacting to situations of economic and financial weakness. On the one hand, it has enabled the EU’s political decision makers to focus their attention on the need to adopt structural instruments that will, in future, make possible a quicker response to the various problems that could emerge. On the other, it has led to the adoption of measures that, in the short term, could minimise the effects of the economic and financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The latter category includes the draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on provisions relating to financial management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. One of the points that should be stressed is the 10% increase in the rate of Union cofinancing for cohesion projects. The regulation applies, inter alia, to euro area countries that have received financial assistance under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, including Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, I voted in favour, in the hope that these instruments will enable the minimisation of the problems we have been experiencing.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The European Union is being confronted with the persistence of the economic and financial crisis having an alarmingly negative impact on the macro-economic stability and budget of Member States. Reductions in national financial resources available to finance public investments have become a clear constraint to cohesion policy implementation and absorption of Structural Funds in some countries. Member States eligible for this measure are defined (1) as those EURO countries that have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) or (2) those NON-EURO countries that that have received financial assistance from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism. The way to provide additional financial assistance through cohesion policy is a ‘top-up’ of the cofinancing rate, allowing for an increase in payments to the countries eligible. The EC proposes a ten percentage point top-up of the applicable cofinancing rates for the priority axis of the programmes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I believe the proposal for a 10% increase in cofinancing rates is beneficial for Portugal, since it will enable the injection of fresh money into the national economy, will bring forward the implementation of EU funds, and will promote projects that will create jobs and generate wealth. The EUR 629 million made available to Portugal represents the moving forward of cohesion policy funds available for the 2007-2013 period, and not new or additional finance for the Member States.

Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have been hardest hit by the crisis and have received financial assistance via the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), in the case of euro area countries, or via the Balance of Payments mechanism for countries outside this area. The measure that has been adopted is temporary and allows the Commission to provide a 10% top-up of the applicable cofinancing rates when the support mechanisms are being applied, with the overall funds allocated to these countries as part of the cohesion policy for the 2007-2013 period remaining unchanged. The relevant Member State submits a request to the Commission within two months of the date from which the Member State meets one of the conditions specified in the regulation. The request will detail the purpose for resorting to the derogation and will provide information about additional measures envisaged for directing the funds towards competitiveness, growth and employment, including with regard to the modification of the operational programmes. The Commission has 30 days from the date when the request was submitted to raise objections. The regulation will be applied retrospectively, and the measure will cease to be applied after the Member State leaves the support mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="en">This proposal aims to harness cohesion policy in order to provide additional financial resources to Member States such as Greece and Portugal, which face huge difficulties in managing their debts. This proposal allows for additional financial assistance through cohesion policy by allowing for a temporary ‘top-up’ increase of present cofinancing rates by up to 10%. While cohesion policy can be used as a tool to assist those Member States who are struggling to finance quality public investments, it is questionable whether this proposal is an adequate reaction to the economic and fiscal problems in the Member States concerned. In many ways, it is just as important to pay attention to the quality of the supported projects and their potential contribution to economic growth, rather than merely seeking to maximise absorption rates of Structural and Cohesion funding in the Member States concerned. Moreover, the proposed arrangement can appear unfair, in that operational programmes in Member States which managed their public finances more carefully will be subject to less favourable cofinancing conditions than those Member States such as Greece, thereby creating a perverse reward for financial irresponsibility. Given these factors, I was unable to support this proposed measure and opted to abstain.</p>

The aforementioned decision, whose legal framework is Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provides for special support measures for the outermost regions of the EU as a means of overcoming the economic disadvantages resulting from their geographic location. The Canary Islands are among the regions considered ‘outermost’. The global economic and financial crisis has had serious repercussions on tourism in the Canary Islands and has caused a significant increase in unemployment in the region, which increased from 17.3% in 2008 to 26.2% in 2009, leading the government of Spain to request from the European Commission a two-year extension of the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC.

This was introduced on the basis of the perceived permanent handicaps that affect the economic and social conditions of these ‘outermost regions’, as they are defined in the Treaty. This report accepts the Commission’s proposal to extend the application of exemptions from and reductions in a tax known as AIEM for certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands. In line with consistent ECR policy on such Article 349 measures, I have refused to support this report in committee, on the basis that the Treaty provision grants an unfair advantage to the three Member States concerned, even though all Member States have their own peripheral regions and yet cannot benefit from such exemptions from harmonising Community provisions on VAT.</p>

      <p sl="de">EU law does not allow favourable tax treatment for local products in comparison with goods from other Member States. In November 2010, Spain made an application to the Commission for an extension to a derogation held by the Canary Islands so that the expiry date would coincide with the expiry of the ‘Guidelines on National Regional Aid for 2007-2013’. The Commission has concluded that, because of the current economic situation in the Canaries, where the slump in the tourism sector has given rise to a rapid rise in the unemployment rate (from no more than 12% to 26.2%), the derogation is appropriate. The rapporteur concurred with this view, as did I.</p>

On more than one occasion, I have proposed setting up a European credit rating agency as a matter of urgency, which would enable us to assess the economies of the Member States objectively and independently, based on clear and transparent rating criteria.

Although recent tensions may indicate the opposite, since 2008, the euro has been a success. Without the single currency, the global financial crisis would have been far worse for all European countries, and furthermore, Europe’s northern countries would not have recovered as quickly as they have done since 2009 through their exports-based model. The consensus today in the academic field is that without the euro, the single market and the free movement of people, which are the greatest successes of the EU, would have probably imploded. I believe, therefore, that the euro has not failed in its function in the face of a big economic and financial crisis, but rather that there has been a problem of economic governance in the euro area. Economic theory teaches us that the viability of a single currency is based on its capacity to minimise major macro-economic imbalances when they exist. It is precisely during these moments of rising tensions for the European project that our currency symbolises that the present failures in the euro area must be considered a valuable experience in order not to repeat the same mistakes.</p>

      <p sl="el">The statutory role of the European Central Bank, to safeguard price stability without heed for the repercussions on the real economy, has proven to be catastrophic under the present circumstances. Unfortunately, the report does not recognise the weaknesses in the statutory objectives of the ECB and sees this specific fact in a positive light. The role of the ECB needs to be changed into a role of real solidarity and support for nations and Member States. This specific ECB annual report for 2010 does not recognise that, at a crucial time, the ECB hid behind decisions to contain inflation and that this had a series of unfortunate consequences. Firstly, it failed to halt rocketing spreads; secondly, it failed to halt action by the ‘speculation mafia’ in credit rating agencies. On the contrary, it incorporated them into its charter. Thirdly, it kept interest rates high, in a period of recession, higher than in the US and higher than in Great Britain. Finally, the independence of the ECB is a very moot point, as ‘independent bankers’ are being canonised, to the point of being made prime ministers, as we have already seen in two countries. The Central Bank is being politically manipulated. Political, parliamentary control of the ECB is needed. It is for all these reasons that I voted against the report.</p>

In addition to the increasingly active approach of the ECB to managing the crisis, particularly in the summer of 2011, the report considers several scenarios to be explored by the EU, such as the creation of the European Ministry of Finance, a European Treasury and a European Monetary Fund, as well as the greater involvement of the ECB, along with the Commission and the International Monetary Fund, in countries that have been subject to intervention, among other proposals that are currently being discussed in the EU.

Recently, we have also been able to see the way in which its intervention can calm the markets. Given the crisis that the EU is experiencing, now more than ever, it is vital that we have a strong and stable euro in order to ensure that the single market and the movement of people and goods are successful. In fact, it was not the euro that failed; the failure came from the governance of the euro area, and, in particular, the breach of the Stability and Growth Pact.

      <p sl="sk">The European Central Bank (ECB) has so far been very successful in holding the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices inflation at a level of around 2%, despite a number of shocks at the macro-financial level and fluctuating commodity prices, and at a time of low average growth in the Union in terms of GDP. However, there is concern over the impact of higher interest rates on economic growth in the euro area, as it might impede what is, in any case, a slow recovery in the euro area, particularly in the weaker economies. In accordance with Article 282 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the main aim of the ECB is to maintain price stability, which contributes to financial stability and appropriate liquidity on financial markets. On the other hand, financial instability is a serious risk for medium-term price stability, since it prevents the smooth operation of currency policy transmission mechanisms. The persistent lack of economic convergence – a situation which is actually constantly deteriorating – remains a structural problem for single currency policy in the euro area. Equally, the impact of currency policy on the different euro area Member States varies substantially, and the assumption is, based on all the evidence, that this asymmetry will further deteriorate if the ECB raises interest rates. This is because most loans are indexed with reference to short-term interest rates in many Member States. For this reason, too, common fiscal governance at Union level is vitally necessary. I firmly believe that much closer international coordination is necessary in order to increase the stability of the global currency system.</p>

In the area of immigration, I would particularly like to mention the pilot project on unaccompanied minors, which received EUR 1 million in funding. Since the beginning of 2011, hundreds of minors who have arrived in Italy from North Africa have, in fact, disappeared, often the victims of organised crime. This pilot project will therefore help to develop reception and integration strategies and good practice in order to protect unaccompanied minors.

The recovery of the single currency and the European economy as a whole will involve important decisions by the ECB, such as the recent decision by the new governor, Mario Draghi, to cut interest rates from 1.5% to 1.25%.

What has been missing is internal discipline in the euro area, particularly regarding compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, as, since 1999, there have been dozens of violations by many countries, and no penalties have never been levied. On account of all this, the euro area has become vulnerable to speculative attacks focused on the sovereign debt of the less efficient and competitive countries. We believe that the European Monetary Union has a duty to keep inflation under control and protect the purchasing power of the currency. In order to continue making the euro a viable project, it is necessary to build a clear framework that makes it possible to help countries with liquidity problems, but, at the same time, is able to incentivise fiscal responsibility and the sustained convergence of competitive levels between Member States.</p>

At the end of the day, the ECB is only responsible for the purchasing power stability of the euro. Its primary role is to keep inflation within the single currency zone in check. The ECB may view its purchases as being important for the stability of the capital markets. However, the reality is that the fact that the ECB has been operating in the grey area between fiscal and monetary policy has in no way pushed down the interest burden on the crisis states within the euro.

Worse still, this report welcomes the ‘constant and rigorous’ stance taken by the ECB and its successful fight against inflation. Even worse than that, the report promotes a new political role for the ECB, calling on it to broaden its activities. To my mind, the essential issue is, on the contrary, the need to place the ECB under political supervision and to force it to intervene to support the Member States, employment and social cohesion instead of the financial markets and the banks. It should therefore be allowed, in the first instance, to offer direct loans to Member States, rather than leaving them to rely on market rates. This would prevent unnecessary complications such as the current proposal to allow the ECB to lend money to the International Monetary Fund so that the latter can pass it on to the Member States.

Without the strong single currency, the impact of the financial crisis would be considerably more dire, however – the deficit-to-GDP ratio for the United States is currently 101.1%, while the rate for Japan is as high as 212.1%.

In order to sustain the single currency, the rapporteur recommends building a clear framework that makes it possible to support Member States with liquidity problems.

Finally, the rapporteur calls for the creation of a European Ministry of Finance and a European Treasury able to issue eurobonds in order to prevent the repeat of previous errors. Given that I failed to share all of the rapporteur’s views, I had to vote against this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Early school leaving (ESL) is a social issue that absolutely must be tackled. More than 6 million young people in the EU leave school before finishing secondary school. The average ESL rate in the EU is 14%. The phenomenon also significantly affects Roma and differently able children. For the latter, the ESL rate is far higher than for their peers, and only 40% get to secondary school. Member States must adopt inclusive integration policies and more efficient actions to reduce ESL, which is one of the major causes of poverty and unemployment.

One of the five Europe 2020 headline targets indeed is to reduce the proportion of early school leavers to less than 10% and to increase the share of the younger generation with a degree or diploma or equivalent level of education to at least 40%. It is fundamental to stress that early school leaving has severe consequences for the EU’s social cohesion as it damages the career prospects, health and wellbeing of young people. A low level of education is also a key cause of poverty, negative health and social exclusion. Unfortunately, it is a matter of fact that early school leaving is particularly pronounced among children from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds and children from migrant families. The equality of opportunities and choice in education is vital for creating a fairer and inclusive society. In that regard, a fundamental role is played by the public services. Therefore, the possible public spending cuts in the education sector, on account of the economic crisis and the budgetary austerity policies, will have a terrible impact.</p>

In Romania, the school dropout rate has risen by a third in the last 10 years from 1.8% to 2.4%. This issue is exacerbated by the current economic and social crisis. The Roma community continues to be the most affected. According to studies, 4 out of 5 children who do not attend school in Romania are Roma. There are numerous causes for this situation. One of them is the difficulty families have in supporting and encouraging their children to pursue some form of education. In these circumstances, practical, structured support needs to be offered by the school, community and authorities. At the moment, one of the problems in this area is the lack of national good practices. This is why, for example, the Roma Education Centre was set up in Bihor County, which helps devise alternative educational programmes. One of the actions introduced is an informal educational programme called ‘Summer nursery’, which is aimed at eliminating the disparities between Roma and non-Roma children registering for class I in terms of pre-school preparation. I support initiatives of this kind which will make a significant contribution to implementing the National Roma Inclusion Strategy.</p>

Ms Honeyball’s report addresses a major priority: reducing the rate of early school leaving to less than 10%. This is a major challenge. In 2009, the early school leaving rate among young people aged 18 to 24 in Europe stood at 14.4%. Most countries in the European Union have made progress in reducing the number of young people leaving school early or with low qualifications, but a great deal still remains to be done if we are to achieve this aim. I believe that the guidelines outlined in this report are extremely constructive. They include the tailoring of educational pathways and training to individual needs, early identification of and support for pupils who are at risk of leaving school early, recognition of the impact of social inequalities, the development of vocational training and better provision for disabled students. We still have to commit the funding needed to implement this. The European educational system must ensure that no young person leaves school without a solid foundation of basic skills enabling him or her to follow training courses, embark on further education or find a job.</p>

In these contexts, the rapporteur proposes specific forms of support and the adoption of measures that would allow students without identity documents to go to school. More particularly, specific measures for Roma are warmly recommended. Given the latter’s traditional custom of moving frequently, as they are nomadic, they would require special measures in order to overcome these difficulties which naturally lead to a high level of ESL within their youth population. As happens with many measures put to the vote, again a significant emphasis is being placed on these communities, which receive special treatment by the House.

This is why the EU’s action in implementing numerous measures and instruments to provide better support to Member States in drafting efficient and effective national policies for tackling this issue is important. Furthermore, the Europe 2020 strategy outlines six headline targets for Member States, one of which is a 10% reduction in the school dropout rate by 2020. However, the previous target set in 2003 was only met by seven Member States because, at the end of 2009, the school dropout rate for all young people aged between 18 and 24 was 14.4%. High dropout rates have major social and economic implications. Dropping out of school has an adverse impact on economic growth, resulting in economic and social instability. This is why actions aimed at harnessing the energy and developing the skills of young people are crucial for the future economic and social development of Member States.

      <p sl="pt">The reality is that young people’s employability largely depends on their level of qualifications.

To combat this phenomenon, it is necessary to innovate and diversify the national curriculum by extending the variety of educational options open to pupils. Offering students a wider choice at school is not only important for increasing their motivation to stay on, but also for providing them with the broad spectrum of knowledge and essential skills necessary for finding employment later. Structural reforms are important for giving young people the skills and training that they need to make a smooth transition into the world of work. These include problem solving, critically evaluating information, and communicating effectively. I believe it is important to set up ‘second chance’ or ‘alternative’ schools. These must be sensitive to the needs of individuals.

It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’.

It supports the achievement of two of them above all: arriving at so-called smart growth by improving the level of education and vocational training, and arriving at so-called inclusive growth by eliminating one of the largest risk factors of unemployment and poverty. The reasons for early school leaving vary considerably between individual countries, and within regions. I firmly believe that policies for reducing the numbers of early school leavers must be adapted to the specific situation in regions or countries, since it is impossible to achieve a common solution benefiting all Member States. Early school leaving clearly occurs more often with disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as young people with special needs, for example. Early school leaving subsequently results in social disadvantage and entails a risk of social exclusion.

      <p sl="fr">Everything starts at school – it is where our children are given the keys to their future in educational and cultural terms. However, every year in Europe, more than six million children leave the educational system with no qualifications. Early school leaving is an important contributory factor to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, and it presents Europe with an enormous challenge: our children are our future and we must act on their behalf. Therefore, I am delighted that our Parliament has adopted a resolution on tackling early school leaving during this plenary session. In particular, I fully support certain key provisions in this report: greater efforts to achieve a ‘personalised approach’ for every child, greater access to educational support for all pupils, better careers guidance with more exposure to entrepreneurialism, the end of separate special education for the disabled to enable those pupils to become better integrated and, finally, the creation of more second chance schools, which are excellent and very effective in terms of getting young people who have left the educational system back into the world of work and society. These are all extremely relevant provisions if we want to improve our educational systems in Europe, but the Member States still need to implement them.</p>

That is why I voted in favour of adopting this resolution, in order to call on Member States to undertake educational reforms that target those children who are most at risk of early school leaving, and who usually come from poor, marginalised or migrant families. A special effort should be made for Roma children, of whom 20% are not enrolled in school at all and 30% are early school leavers. The success of the ‘second chance schools’ programme should be boosted in order to help reintegrate early school leavers. Lastly, different learning methods could also help to reverse this trend, as could the promotion of educational pathways that reward practical skills more.</p>

The first one is to the EU institutions, calling on them, despite the crisis, to continue investing in education and programmes to prevent and take action against early school leaving as the most important policy for preventing inequality and social exclusion. The second message is to individuals, to tell them that they must not give up their right to education at a time like this, when Europe is redefining its role in the world, not least in economic and social terms. Having highly-qualified citizens is not just a right to be guaranteed but a moral obligation to be promoted. The European Commission has already said that within just a few years, 85% of jobs will require a high level of qualifications. The more training people have, the less unemployment there will be, with better jobs and less insecurity. Today, combating the phenomenon of children dropping out of school is the most crucial policy for helping people to find a place in the employment market. Creating cross-cutting strategies between individuals, EU institutions and the educational community is of fundamental importance in order to combat exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Roma pupils are frequently subject to low-quality education throughout the EU, often aggravated by segregated education and gypsy-only classrooms. Their difficulties in receiving quality education result in their astoundingly low educational achievements: 20% of Roma children are not enrolled in school, 30% are early school leavers and some 50% of Roma are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Local governments must take appropriate measures for the reintegration of early school leavers up to the maximum age of compulsory education and the institution must inform the parents and the local government about school-leavers. Assistance mechanisms, such as scholarships and mentoring support should be established for young Roma, to inspire them not only to obtain diplomas, but also to enrol in higher education. A system of perks should also be considered, which would increase the participation of Roma youth in such institutions and improve their qualifications. Teachers who teach underprivileged students or are employed in lagging-behind regions should be financially compensated and receive appropriate training. It is also necessary to create specific programmes targeting pre-school education and to develop semi-boarding programmes and ‘tutoring’ in schools, simultaneously targeting the adult age group with vocational training and lifelong learning programmes.</p>

This report is consistent with the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to reduce the rate of early school leaving to less than 10%. In France, we have set ourselves the ambitious goal of bringing that rate down to 9.5%. It is vital to get to the root of the problem and ensure that these young people do not become marginalised. For that reason, I fully support the recommendations made in this report, which highlights the need to identify and support, right from early childhood, those young people who are at high risk of leaving school early.

      <p sl="bg">I supported this resolution as tackling early school leaving is one of the measures which need to be taken to reduce unemployment, increase employment and prevent the loss of the EU’s social and economic potential. I regard it as important to work towards keeping pupils at school, as well as giving those who stopped their education early a second chance. This will allow young people to be given the opportunity to participate fully in society and will reduce the risk of social exclusion. I share the view that a greater focus is required on vulnerable groups, as well as on the population living in poorer and remote regions, as they are hit hardest by this problem. Research carried out in Bulgaria indicates that the main reasons for children dropping out of school are not associated with their reluctance to go, but with the educational and social status of their parents. Problems of this kind require enhanced coordination between the individual institutions, an improvement in educational assistance, social services and additional support for the families. I believe that providing equal opportunities and access to high-quality education to people from every group will contribute to growth in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Nowadays, in view of the low birth rate, it is vital that young people receive education to a level that enables them to find valuable and well-paid jobs in later life.

The use of innovative teaching solutions can have an impact on pupils’ development, which will encourage them to continue their education. Unconventional education methods, for example, dance, theatre or other forms of expression, may lead to a reduction in early school leaving.

The social and economic implications of high rates of ESL are stark. Interventions to harness the energy and develop the skills of young people are therefore crucial. Structural reforms are therefore important for giving young people the skills and training that they need to make a smooth transition into the world of work It is crucial that schools encourage students’ mobility between the different educational streams, be it academic, vocational, and so on.

ESL as acknowledged in Ms Honeyball’s report is a complex phenomenon that affects all of European society and takes on different forms in different Member States. All EU and national measures need to be reinforced in order to help the most vulnerable families and ensure a high level of education for our children, foster the adoption of a personalised and inclusive approach to education starting from primary level education, encourage the sharing of responsibilities between families, school and public authorities, and improve the way people who have previously left school early are reintegrated into the education system, by developing ‘second chance’ schools, as clearly described by the rapporteur.

At the moment, unfortunately, a large number of young people are leaving school early, with an inadequate level of qualifications. This reduces appreciably the chances of them being successful in life, of social integration and of getting a well-paid job. What is significant is that, according to the statistics, reducing the school dropout rate by one percentage point could produce every year 1 million well-qualified young people and new opportunities for economic growth. In this respect, it is important for us to identify those measures capable of reducing the incidence of dropping out. For example, counselling could be offered to both pupils and their parents, given the influence the family environment has on pupils’ educational and social path. Extra-curricular activities organised within educational institutions also make a vital contribution. At the same time, I should point out the additional support which must be provided to people with disabilities to offer them suitable qualifications, as well as ‘second chance’ type solutions for those who have dropped out of school, but would like to continue their training.</p>

In addition, we can observe that children from families in which the level of education is lower are much more likely to drop out. Migrants, too, have a higher dropout rate. Nevertheless, a one-size-fits-all approach to this phenomenon is not appropriate and it certainly cannot be isolated from external influences such as poverty or abuse.

The Member States are all experiencing this problem, which is increasing dramatically and therefore justifies the fact that Parliament has focused on the issue by voting, this afternoon, for a resolution on early school leaving. According to recent figures, 52% of young people who leave school with no qualifications find themselves out of work, and will join the ranks of the 5.5 million young people who are unemployed. This is quite simply unacceptable and untenable in the long term if we want to maintain social cohesion and intergenerational solidarity in our Western societies. That is why we should welcome the interesting proposals set out in the Honeyball report, such as extending compulsory education from the age of 16 to 18, and setting up more ‘second chance schools’, given that a single approach does not suit all young people in schools. Reversing this trend of early school leaving cannot be achieved by decree; it requires investment in education. It is important to reassert the value of technical streams and guarantee that qualifications will entitle a person to a job. Entitlement not luck: that is the dilemma that needs to be resolved in the field of education.</p>

Consequently, the EU has been putting in place numerous measures and tools to better support Member States in developing efficient and effective national policies to tackle it. They include the Commission communication on tackling early school leaving, a new proposal for a Council recommendation on policies to reduce ESL and the Commission’s initiative ‘Youth on the Move’. Most EU countries have made at least some progress in reducing the number of young people leaving school early or with low qualifications, and there has been a noticeable and positive change in how they approach ESL.

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the resolution on tackling early school leaving. The text recalls one of the main goals of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing the rate of early school leaving to less than 10% by 2020, which would have a positive impact in terms of cutting youth unemployment and improving employment rates in the EU (more than half of Europeans who left school early are currently unemployed). This goal is all the more important given that the number of jobs available for low-skilled or unskilled labour will decline even further in the coming years. The resolution also highlights a worrying situation: one young person out of every four currently has reading difficulties. It is clear, however, that reading is a vital tool for making progress in any school subject, becoming integrated into the world of work, understanding information, communicating properly and participating in cultural activities. Let us therefore go back to basics: specific measures for remedying deficiencies in reading skills are urgently required. Furthermore, we should promote early learning of new information and communication technologies (NICT), such as language technologies, which young people have the advantage of being able to master quickly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported this report in plenary because it tackles a real scourge, which mostly affects young people who are already in a precarious situation. It cannot be denied that early school leaving is often linked to poverty and social exclusion. If we combat one, we therefore combat the others. This report puts forward simple guidelines: early identification, increased support and a personalised approach. These solutions are well known, but very few Member States today have the will to implement them as a priority. The fact is that if we enable more young people to take full advantage of their education, it will raise the overall skills level and therefore increase employment opportunities. One final word on reading: the proportion of young people aged 15 who have reading difficulties has reached 24.1% in the Member States. If we have to choose a point of attack, that is it. In my view, reading is the key to all forms of knowledge, and it cannot be dispensed with. We need to ensure that all young people, whether they reach the end of the school system or leave early, have that key in their pocket.</p>

      <p sl="it">In order to tackle youth unemployment in the EU, we need to implement a series of measures such as extending compulsory education to the age of 18 and creating ‘second chance’ schools. These schools would have teachers, psychologists and trainers to allow young people in situations of difficulty, poverty and early failure, also brought about by an excessively rigid existing education system, to be reintegrated into the education system with flexible learning programmes sensitive to their interests and extra-curricular pastimes. In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service.</p>

In addition, more funds need to be allocated and access to the EU’s lifelong learning programme needs to be improved.

The target of reducing early school leaving to 10% by 2020 is still far from being achieved; in 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%. There are many factors which lead to early school leaving, which occurs particularly in at-risk groups associated with poverty, abuse, family background, underachievement, and ethnic minorities and immigrant populations. If this problem is tackled successfully, it will lead to the reduction of intergenerational poverty and will provide economic growth in the medium and long term.</p>

The EU’s competitiveness depends on quality and on young people having access to good-quality education. I should emphasise the link between dropping out of school and youth unemployment. More than half of the young people who had left school early in the EU were unemployed in 2009. Dropping out of school means precarious jobs, while the long-term economic and social impact of this problem poses a high risk of poverty. Tackling the problem of dropping out is an effective way of preventing social exclusion among young people. I urge Member States to invest in teacher training and in providing staff with qualifications, both in pre-school and compulsory education. I should stress that information and communications technology (ICT) can have a positive impact in an educational setting and can encourage motivation and learning. Member States should promote and increase pupils’ access to ICT and introduce training programmes for teachers. I call for additional funds and increased accessibility as regards the EU lifelong learning programme, as well as extra funds for increasing pupil and teacher mobility.</p>

The Czech Republic, next to Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia, has long been among the four Member States with the lowest level of early school leaving, and, with a figure of 5.6%, it is also well below the EU’s target value for 2020 (the EU average in 2008 was 14.9%). In the debate on this report, I adopted a contrary position, because I do not think we will resolve the situation by developing payment-free public crèches and day-care facilities, or by Member States providing out-of-school activities and groups, as the report proposes. At the same time, I have reservations over the effect of the proposed social mapping of people who leave school early by collecting and centralising data from all Member States here in Brussels. In my opinion, rather than the gung-ho measures called for by the report, we in the Czech Republic should primarily aim to analyse the specific causes of early school leaving and to respond immediately if the situation deteriorates, in other words, if the percentage of early school leavers increases.</p>

The report also includes recommendations which are idealistic, impractical and verging on the irrational. If, as the report suggests, EU Member States are to provide financial support to parents who ‘devote time and love to bringing up young children’, the next obvious step would be the establishment of an EU love police to check that all European children are receiving the necessary Brussels-sanctioned quota of affection.

This discussion is now at an end, as Parliament has ceded to the Council, giving up on an equal footing between the colegislators, which it had earlier asserted.</p>

According to the ACP countries, the amount of aid needed to maintain their banana sector, cushioning them from the impact of this liberalisation, will be approximately EUR 500 million.

      <p sl="pt">However, having been part of the Conciliation Committee that negotiated with the Council, I believe that this regulation is the best that it could be. It is not the case, as those who oppose the regulation say, that Parliament will have fewer powers than the Council in monitoring its application by the Commission. I do not believe that any national parliament goes so far in monitoring national programmes of aid to developing countries. Neither Parliament nor the Council can replace the Commission in exercising the powers of execution granted to it by the Treaties. This is a simple case of respect for the separation of powers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Banana production for export to the EU is an important economic activity for many of the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of States because this has a knock-on effect for the entire economy in these regions. For this reason, the EU offers banana exporters from the ACP Group of States certain trade preferences. This enables the EU to encourage prosperity and economic dynamism in the region without simply providing a supply of monetary aid. This establishes an incentive for people to cultivate a product in their own country, then market and export it. Thus, a programme with accompanying measures for the banana sector is required for the most important banana suppliers in the ACP Group of States. That is why I voted in favour of this report.</p>

On the contrary, the EUR 190 million aid package to be shared between 10 countries over four years seems to me to be quite justifiable. I am, however, very concerned by the way in which Parliament’s powers have been denied at every stage of the negotiations on this text. Even though the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon means that Parliament is now on an equal footing with the Council when it comes to overseeing the Commission’s implementing powers, the Council has demanded the right to merely inform Parliament of the implementing measures that will be taken following the adoption of this text.

While our fellow European citizens have the growing impression that democracy is labouring under the yoke of economic constraints, the European Parliament would have sent them a positive signal by strengthening the prerogatives conferred on it in 2007 and by defending those granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament, being on an equal footing with the Council, makes strategic decisions regarding the financing of development cooperation, and has a democratic right of scrutiny.

The EU has a strategic interest in strengthening the various links with these countries, especially in the area of economic, commercial, academic and scientific exchanges, and it therefore needs a financing instrument to enable the funding of these measures which, by nature, do not meet the conditions of official development aid. Four preparatory actions were established within the framework of budgetary procedures in 2007 and 2008 in order to fulfil this aim: commercial and scientific exchanges with India, commercial and scientific exchanges with China, cooperation with middle-income-group countries in Asia and cooperation with middle-income-group countries in Latin America.

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of this report’s proposal, which aims to achieve more flexible financial instruments for promoting democracy and human rights worldwide. These financial instruments are important. Their adoption as a package – comprising the development cooperation instrument (DCI), the related banana accompanying measures (DCI/BAM), the industrialised countries instrument plus (ICI+) and the European instrument for democracy and human rights (EIDHR) – was essential in order to slim down the procedures for accessing these financial instruments, thereby allowing them to be managed in a unified way that also made it easier to standardise the relevant bureaucratic processes. Conciliation on a particularly delicate subject like the use of financial instruments to promote democracy and human rights worldwide is an important and tangible indicator of the European institutions’ shared desire to ensure that such instruments are used in a consistent way and that they work more effectively and with fewer problems.</p>

The EU can use this instrument to finance political parties, foundations and even individual people in any third country of its choice, without any authorisation from the target country. Thus, we have seen how it has been used since 2006, the year in which it was created, to finance destabilising groups in certain countries in Latin America.</p>

All the other instruments in this area allow for flexibility to accept, on a case by case basis, these costs to be financed in the interest of a proper implementation of programmes and projects.

The EU office in Afghanistan paid my constituent EUR 70 000 to make a documentary on the plight of women who have been raped or beaten and then imprisoned under the country’s justice system. These unreasonable punishments and discrimination against women were highlighted in my constituent’s film In-Justice. And yet the EU Delegation refuses to release this film.

      <p sl="pt">The objectivity of statistics as a branch of applied mathematics gives it a special status both in the area of scientific research and in public and private organisations. There is no government that does not have a body responsible for statistical studies. The EU itself has the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat). In an ever-growing area where roads are taking on a key role in the transport of goods, reliable data are vital in order to shape all of the studies in this area, which are only possible using statistics. This report, drafted by Mr Simpson, concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods by road in the EU (recast). Given the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, according to which this proposal does not include any substantive amendments, I am voting in favour.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods by road has repeatedly been amended in a fundamental way. On the occasion of further amendments, it would be appropriate, on grounds of transparency, to recast this directive. In the interests of fulfilling the roles published by the Commission in connection with the common transport policy, it is appropriate for the Commission to have available comparable, reliable, harmonised, regular and comprehensive statistical data on the scope and development of the carriage of goods by road performed by vehicles registered in the Union, and on the level of use of the vehicles providing this transport. It is necessary to compile comprehensive regional statistics on the carriage of goods and the journeys of vehicles. At the same time, however, the scope of the powers delegated to the Commission should not be too wide. For this reason, and in accordance with the similar procedure adopted in the case of the regulation on statistics in the area of tourism, it would be appropriate, in my opinion, to adopt amendments aimed at restricting the scope of the power delegated to the Commission, and to establish other conditions for the exercise of these powers.</p>

However, it is not enough to demand that the exercising of the delegated powers should not place any additional financial burden on those obliged to furnish reports.

Since 2004, with the enlargement of the EU by 10 countries including Poland, the Kaliningrad region has become a de facto Russian enclave within the EU, which has brought about a profound change in living conditions for local citizens. The initiatives put into action have so far not led to a significant reduction in the marginalisation of the inhabitants of the region in question and the region itself; there was therefore an objective need to remedy this situation.

This would prevent the fragmentation of the region into various different districts and thereby enable the inhabitants of the region to enjoy facilitations for local border traffic.

The adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 allows the European Union to operate a general waiver on local traffic at external land borders for persons living in a border area, understood to be the land within 30 km of the border. Member States can therefore allow people who live in border areas to enter the Union with just a local border permit, without needing to present any other documents, such as a visa. Poland and the Russian Federation put forward an amendment to the regulation in light of the special circumstances in the Kaliningrad region. Here, a region with around one million inhabitants that is totally surrounded by the EU except for the Baltic Sea is artificially divided into three districts: one subject to a local border traffic agreement with Poland, one to an agreement with Lithuania and one not subject to any agreement.

There have been many regulations easing the border and travel restrictions between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia; however, such initiatives have not been successful.

The success of this agreement has been such that some countries that do not belong to the European Union have signed this agreement. A regulation called the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) was approved in order to regulate the monitoring of people crossing external borders. The small province of Kaliningrad, in the Russian Federation, is fully surrounded by two Member States, and since EU enlargement in 2004, has been the only enclave in the EU, so it should be classified as a local border traffic area under the SBC.

The aim is to avoid the creation of obstacles preventing commercial, social and cultural exchanges or regional cooperation with neighbours. In implementing the local border traffic regime, a Member State may conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries aimed at addressing specific needs in relation to their respective neighbours. Ties between the Kaliningrad region and its neighbours were greatly circumscribed particularly as a result of the expansion of the Union in 2004. There have been a number of EU initiatives in the past which facilitated the movement of Kaliningrad residents, but these proved to be insufficient given the specific geographical situation of the enclave. Poland and the Russian Federation are therefore requesting a change to the regulation to take account of the specific situation of this region. The European Commission is inclined to take a positive view, as long as this only involves the resolution of an isolated situation.

Therefore, while supporting the general idea of facilitating local border traffic from and to Kaliningrad, it seems appropriate to postpone the decision on this measure until mutual trust and cooperation as regards Kaliningrad are built between the Russian Federation and the EU and its Member States.</p>

I hope that in response, the Russian Federation will strengthen cooperation with relevant EU Member States in areas such as combating organised crime and smuggling (particularly cigarettes produced in the Kaliningrad region and fuel), so that finally, we can anticipate cooperation as regards plans to construct nuclear power plants in the Kaliningrad region and progress in joint projects such as the Nemunas Euroregion.

I find it hard to imagine that visa requirements can be lifted in relation to a country whose state structures protect people who are guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as is the case with Mikhail Golovatov, nor at a time when Russia refuses to cooperate in such categories of cases as those that took place on 13 January and the Medininkai killings.

This derogation from the regulation is based on the desire to ensure good relations between peoples, without centuries-old economic, social and cultural ties between the different communities coming undone. This is the case in the region of Kaliningrad, called Königsberg in German, which was part of the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1992, and since then has belonged to the Russian Federation, with a natural border with the Baltic Sea, and land borders with Poland and Lithuania.

Around 1 million people live in three districts completely surrounded by EU territory.

Council Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 sets down rules for local border traffic and external land borders of Member States (relating to a zone of 30 km) that are an exception to the provisions of the Schengen Agreement. In order to implement this regulation, the affected countries can conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries in order to take the special conditions sufficiently into account. The EU has introduced initiatives in an effort to make it easier for those living in the area to commute between Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland. Thus far, however, these initiatives have proven inadequate. Poland and the Russian Federation have now petitioned for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006: as an exception, the border area is to be extended to 50 km so that the whole Kaliningrad area would be designated a border area.

It should also be emphasised that, unlike Turkey, Croatia has always pushed forward with the promised reforms.

A spontaneous accession, rather than accession by default, is needed, given the efforts made by Croatia’s people, and given, too, its standard of living and the economic situation in Croatia, both of which are much better than the indicators for other countries were when they joined. The crisis that has reigned in the Union since 2009 also implies the need for a firm stance towards new members, who have to become part of a virtuous circle: tight budgets and relentless efforts to combat corruption and to promote transparency.

Despite considerable progress, however, I firmly believe that it is important to continue with the reforms initiated, that it is necessary to focus particularly on commitments undertaken in the area of the judiciary, internal affairs and basic rights – including the protection of media freedom, the impartial resolution of war crimes cases, the fight against corruption, protection of minorities, border controls, police cooperation, the fight against organised crime and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters – as well as on commitments undertaken in the area of competition policy. Croatia’s determination to combat corruption, and also the progress achieved in the area of women’s rights and gender equality, for example, are pleasing. It is desirable for Croatia to continue consolidating good neighbourly relations, to continue as an important and active promoter of regional cooperation at all levels, and to back up its efforts towards membership with steps that will be economically, socially and generally beneficial to all citizens of this region.</p>

I hope that Croatia’s success will encourage the other states in the region to go energetically down this path. Even after the Treaty concerning the Accession of the Republic of Croatia has been signed at the European Council on 8-9 December, it will not be a time for relaxation but rather for continuing political and economic reforms, in particular, in the areas of consolidating the rule of law, combating corruption and organised crime, safeguarding human rights, improving the business environment and creating friendly and stable relations with neighbours. The EU must also prepare properly for Croatia’s accession, take account of it in the 2013 multiannual financial framework, and include Croatia in negotiations for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework. I hope that the ratification process in EU countries will run smoothly and that Croatia will be ready to become the 28th Member State as scheduled from 1 July 2013, during the Lithuanian Council Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="en">The green light by the European Parliament to the application of Croatia to accede to the EU comes at a very right time. When some external actors may wish to see the EU disintegrating, the accession of a new member sends out a reassuring signal: ‘The reports of its death are greatly exaggerated’. The accession of Croatia does not, however, mark the end of the country’s European integration. The experience of Estonia, as well as of the other Member States that have joined recently, has taught that even more difficult challenges lay ahead. It is far more demanding to establish a relatively small country as a full-fledged active Member State on a routine basis than to meet the fixed criteria and conclude the negotiations. Membership calls for a long-term perspective, patience and willingness to compromise for the common good in order to secure the viability of European Union as an influential global actor.

      <p sl="pt">The report in question, drafted by Mr Casini, deals with the amendments to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure relating to the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament with respect to financial interests and conflicts of interest. The current economic crisis, which many citizens attribute to politicians’ wrong decisions, has led to this group of professionals being put under very tight public surveillance involving new information technology, as in the case of Wikileaks, with the disclosure of confidential information. Today, more than ever before, it is crucial that rules for transparency are established with respect to the financial interests of public officials. In the case of Members of the European Parliament, under the terms of Article 232 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is up to Parliament to establish rules on the interests of its Members. As I am aware that appearances are extremely important, I am voting for the proposed amendments to the existing regulation.</p>

I am glad that we managed to reach a compromise during work in the relevant committee, as reflected by the large number of votes cast by my fellow Members in favour of amending the Rules of Procedure. New changes to the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament represent yet another important step towards introducing clearer rules and, at the same time, clear sanctions for a failure to comply with these rules, and they aim to increase confidence in Parliament as well as making the work of the European institutions more transparent overall.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new rules focus on introducing rigorous provisions in relation to the problem of conflicts of interest, the preparation of financial statements published on Parliament’s website and the acceptance of special gifts. Moreover, the new provisions also cover rapporteurs, who may lose their mandate if they violate the abovementioned rules contained in the Code of Conduct. I think that the creation of an Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members is also a good initiative, which will assist Members in the practical interpretation and implementation of the rules of the code. I would once again like to thank the rapporteur from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the huge amount of work he has put into preparing the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of establishing this new Code of Conduct for MEPs. The code forbids Members from undertaking lobbying activities alongside their parliamentary duties, prohibits us from receiving gifts worth more than EUR 150, requires us to notify all the activities that we carry out and remuneration that we receive whilst we are MEPs and before we take office, and requires us to declare any membership of an association, any type of interest in a company or organisation of so-called ‘influence’ and any other type of financial interest. In particular, I voted in favour of Amendment 10, which proposed abolishing the EUR 5 000 threshold above which MEPs must declare all outside activities for which they receive payment. By establishing these strict rules, our Parliament intends to make its daily activities clearer and more transparent. Equally, this is about restoring, to some extent, the external image of MEPs and about combating the prevailing anti-parliamentarism. This code is also intended to re-establish everyone’s accountability. I regret, however, that such measures are only adopted in response to scandals (one recalls here the scandal of the three MEPs caught acting in a blatantly corrupt manner by lobbyists in March 2011).</p>

      <p sl="lt">Although the European Parliament has become a fully-fledged legislative institution under the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, as regards establishing the EU budget, the media and voters probably talk more about our salaries, benefits and related scandals than about the work we do. It is also a fact that Members of the European Parliament are able to obtain any amount of remuneration or other income from other sources without having to declare or report it to anybody. MEPs’ salaries are several or even many times greater than those of many of their constituents, so that when we talk about reducing poverty in Europe one day and then oppose a requirement to declare additional income the next, we look hypocritical. I welcome the amendments to the Rules of Procedure introducing a requirement to declare any other paid activity and income. It is nevertheless important that these provisions are actually implemented and do not remain merely aspirational. On the other hand, I believe that we could go even further by prohibiting MEPs from receiving any additional remuneration, as is done in some Member States’ national parliaments. Surely we will not become impoverished by living solely from our salary?</p>

      <p sl="de">The present crisis of confidence underlines the need for a clear code of conduct for Members of the European Parliament in relation to financial interests and possible conflicts of interest. Every MEP should perform his or her duties in accordance with the fundamental principles of impartiality, integrity, openness, due diligence, honesty, responsibility and maintaining Parliament’s good name. When a conflict of interest arises, the provisions of this code of conduct should provide some guidance. If the MEP is unable to resolve the conflict of interest, he is obliged to inform the President in writing. In cases of doubt, confidential advice can be sought from the Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members. In addition, before speaking or voting in plenary or at any of Parliament’s institutions, or when proposed as rapporteur, every Member should disclose any existing or potential conflict of interest in relation to the matter under consideration. Such a disclosure can be made orally or in writing to the President during the relevant parliamentary debates. I believe that these measures make sense and will promote confidence.

      <p sl="et">I consider it important to change the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, which would, among other things, create a better overview of Members’ paid extra-parliamentary activities and the income connected therewith. Although I support Mr Casini’s report, I do not support sub-clause ‘e’ of the motion to amend clause 2 number 10, which would require Members of Parliament to declare in their declarations of economic interests only those extra-parliamentary expenses above EUR 5 000 per calendar year. I find that the establishment of such a limit is not justified because it would encourage the non-declaration of income that falls just short of the EUR 5 000 limit. In addition, it is unclear why EUR 5 000 should be chosen as the limit; why not EUR 2 000 or 200, for instance? EUR 5 000 is a large amount of money – in many Member States, it represents the annual pay of a worker who earns average wages. I believe that in the interests of greater transparency, Members of the European Parliament should declare all income received from extra-parliamentary activities, and if we are to set a limit, it could be 10 times lower, for instance, EUR 500.</p>

Be that as it may, and to quote a colleague who has a way with words: ‘Catching someone with their hand in the cookie jar is no reason to ban cookies …’ Even with the strictest possible rules and penalties, you will not prevent abuse.

Subsequently, on 28 October 2010, Viktor Uspaskich brought an action for the annulment of Parliament’s decision of 7 September 2010 before the General Court, only to withdraw it in July 2011. In a letter of 5 April 2011 requesting the defence of his immunity, he claims that the criminal proceedings initiated by the Lithuanian authorities prevent him from performing, or make it difficult for him to perform, his parliamentary duties by restraining his freedom of movement contrary to Article 7 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.

      <p sl="pt">Following the criminal proceedings brought against a Member of this House, Mr Uspaskich, and pending before Vilnius Regional Court (Lithuania), Parliament decided on 7 September 2010 to waive his parliamentary immunity. Mr Uspaskich was unhappy with this decision and submitted two appeals. The first was submitted on 5 April 2011 and was announced in Parliament in the plenary session of 9 May 2011. The second was submitted on 11 April 2011 and was announced in Parliament in the plenary session of 4 July 2011. Since the two requests were related to the same matter, Parliament decided that they should be dealt with together. This report concerns Mr Uspaskich’s request to Parliament of 11 April 2011 to review the decision it made in the plenary session of 7 September 2010 to waive his parliamentary immunity. In view of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I am voting for Parliament’s decision not to defend the parliamentary immunity and privileges of Mr Uspaskich, given that the incidents took place before he was elected to Parliament and are unrelated to his duties as a Member of this House.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is appropriate to deal with the requests made by Viktor Uspaskich on 5 and 11 April 2011 together since they relate to the same legal proceedings. Criminal proceedings have been brought against the Member of the European Parliament (MEP), who is charged essentially with offences of false accounting in relation to the financing of a political party during a period prior to his election to the European Parliament. On 7 September 2010 Parliament waived Viktor Uspaskich’s immunity, considering that no cogent evidence had been furnished as to the existence of any fumus persecutionis and that the offences with which the MEP is charged had nothing to do with his activities as a Member of the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 28 October 2010, Viktor Uspaskich brought an action for the annulment of Parliament’s decision of 7 September 2010 before the General Court, only to withdraw it in July 2011. In a letter of 5 April 2011 requesting the defence of his immunity, he claims that the criminal proceedings initiated by the Lithuanian authorities prevent him from performing, or make it difficult for him to perform, his parliamentary duties by restraining his freedom of movement contrary to Article 7 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. After thoroughly examining all of the available facts, however, Parliament has concluded not to defend the immunity and privileges of Viktor Uspaskich and will forward this decision and the report of its competent committee to the appropriate authority in the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

Through WikiLeaks, my earlier suspicion that the accusations made against Mr Uspaskich were politically motivated, and that procedure was violated in his case, were once again confirmed. Many Lithuanian politicians, including members of the governing party, have admitted that several procedural rules were violated, and that the accusations do not necessarily have any legal basis, but the withdrawal of the accusations made against Mr Uspaskich would tarnish the reputation of Lithuania’s governmental institutions and legal system. All of this reminds me of a series of earlier cases connected with members of my home party, the Estonian Centre Party, where it became clear after the elections that the accusations had been politically motivated and unfounded. In this case, protecting the reputation of the Lithuanian government agencies and legal system is not my concern, but the defence of justice and human rights is.

The experience of the preceding European Semester has shown that national reform programmes still lack transparency and viability.

That is why we need to assess the situation at a European level, so that the Union can take a coordinated approach in order to tackle European and national economic difficulties.

By focusing on the priority of employment and on the idea that the budgetary, economic and social strategies introduced must have a redistributive and developmental role, the report gives new meaning to the prospects of overcoming the crisis, as we hope to do. Unfortunately, the European Parliament is still not involved enough in the European Semester process, just as, in fact, it is often excluded from the current crisis management efforts, which is a key problem for EU democracy and legitimacy. Therefore, I can only share the view that an interparliamentary conference involving both the EP and the national parliaments should be organised next year, so that, finally, we can open a broader debate on the measures we want to take and the project we want to support.</p>

I think that the coordination process needs to have broader democratic legitimacy. For this to happen, the European Parliament and national parliaments need to be more actively involved. I am pleased that the rapporteur abandoned the notion of setting up a special parliamentary committee made up only of MEPs from the countries in the euro area, as such an initiative would have led to a split in Parliament, exerting an adverse impact on its operation. Such a measure is especially difficult to understand as most Member States which are not part of the euro area at the moment, including Romania, would like to adopt the single currency in the future. This means that all the Members of this Parliament have an interest in making the euro area operate efficiently. Last but not least, as is also recommended in this report, I feel it is absolutely essential that Member States’ economic policies attach major importance to economic growth as, in the current climate of austerity, we greatly need policies which will bring us back to the path of economic growth and put an end to austerity.</p>

On the pretext of ‘regaining’ the trust of the markets, citizens’ rights are being sacrificed and social acquis is being trampled underfoot. Continuous austerity and continuous recession, unemployment and poverty are essentially becoming systemic. The European Semester has been overtaken by events. It no longer suffices to safeguard the interests of Ms Merkel and her allies. However, it is the ‘basic idea’ for creating a stricter stability pact and a ‘fiscal union of the willing’ which will put a stranglehold on the Member States and the European people. The budgets of the Member States will be planned and approved by Berlin, while the creation of a multi-track Europe of the ‘strong’ and the ‘weak’ will leave the weaker Member States prey to the whims of speculators. The report on the European Semester is fully in line with the failed neoliberal policies of the EU and deprives the Member States of the facility to exercise an alternative, anti-cyclical policy designed to redistribute wealth and sustainable growth.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report since I believe that coordinating economic policies has an extremely important role to play in this period of major crisis for the European Union. Now more than ever, Europe must take a symmetrical approach, founded on a shared response from the Member States, to the problems deriving from the economic crisis, the resulting increase in inequality and macro-financial imbalances. In my opinion, the various countries’ policies ought to be highly interconnected so as to guarantee sustainable growth and increased employment, as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Union must address European citizens’ lack of faith in European integration. I therefore consider it essential that this coordination is geared towards ensuring greater legitimacy, accountability and transparency in decision-making processes. Furthermore, since the goal of the European Semester is to check that the budget discipline is being applied and to supervise the realisation of the EU 2020 strategy, the requirement for transparency is essential. I am hoping for greater effort from the Member States to ensure that economic, financial and social policies are more effective.</p>

As such, it aims to attribute a greater level of democratic responsibility to national parliaments, in both the preparation and the subsequent implementation of their national budgets, and, at the same time, to offer a platform for the exchange of information and for sharing best budgetary implementation practices. It is undeniable that reinforcing economic coordination policies is one way for Europe to achieve the necessary fiscal consolidation it requires.

It should be noted that in 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%. This is a matter of extreme importance, as by tackling this problem, we will not only boost the self-esteem of citizens, but also improve their quality of life, thus helping to reduce poverty and the number of those who are socially excluded. Firstly, it is necessary to identify groups that are at risk, such as ethnic minorities, parents who have a low level of education, children from rural areas, as well as the causes of dropping out of school, such as academic failure and the factors that exacerbate it, including poverty, abuse and an unstable family background.

This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission.

      <p sl="de">It is a sad fact for the entire global economy that the Eurocrats in Brussels have failed to take any constructive steps in dealing with the financial and economic crisis that has lasted since 2008. What is even worse is the fact that the European leadership continues to close its eyes to any sensible alternative for resolving the problem. Instead, they continue along the wrong path first chosen at the end of the 1990s, when the euro was launched. In their desperation, the Eurocrats can think of no better remedy than to call for even greater centralisation in Brussels. However, instead of shifting more powers to Brussels with the European Semester, what we should be doing is preventing the indebtedness in the first place. In view of the morass that is the debt crisis, the priority should be at all costs to prevent the economically sound members of the euro area from being dragged into the abyss too. Since the European Semester does not offer any rational solutions in this regard, I voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="it">I decided to vote against this report on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination. This is because the entire analysis is based on and geared towards the Europe 2020 strategy, an initiative that is completely failing to bear the expected fruits, perhaps partly as a result of the crisis. However, it is not the first time that these much heralded strategies have turned out to be overwhelming failures, and the crisis cannot be used as an excuse for the expected failure of the Europe 2020 strategy as well. Focusing many of the objectives of economic policy coordination on this strategy looks to me like a move that is risky at best. I must also add that, in various points, it seems to be a case of coordinating the social policies of Member States, rather than their economies. The semester of coordination has only been in place for a few months, but I think that its value and meaning ought to be different from the content of this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Instead of finally giving a chance to weaker national economies outside the euro area, Brussels is now placing its hopes in a planned economy. Economic and social policy, in other words, the key competences of a sovereign state, are now subject to the centralist monitoring of the Commission and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin). National reform programmes have to be presented in Brussels so that ‘anomalies can be identified at an early stage’. The recommendations of the Council and the Commission are then to be implemented in the second semester. This system will never work. This is not just my opinion – a study by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance comes to the same conclusion: it estimates the efficiency of the recommendations in the last semester as non-existent. Why is that? Growth cannot be forced through a centralised planned economy. We need to remedy the mistakes made when the euro area was established and form a hard currency zone. This must be made up of sovereign states with sovereign economic policies. For this reason, I have voted against this report.</p>

When assessing the experience of the first wave of the crisis, EU institutions and Member States should not just look differently at the future but also examine the current situation differently, but this is often not the case. However, the world has changed significantly in recent years. The directives being adopted are not effective enough to overcome the new challenges arising every day and ever growing old challenges in the economic, financial and social fields. Today, the main issue on the EU agenda is that of the scale of unemployment in Member States. We must implement urgent measures and programmes to ensure that unemployment is reduced by at least a third as quickly as possible. I believe that the Commission should, as soon as possible, envisage and submit specific plans laying down measures which enable progress to be made in implementing the main immediate and short-term objectives in the areas of job creation, innovation, education, energy and social inclusion.</p>

Quite rightly, we need to go back to having rules on budgetary discipline, and procedures must be automatic. However, we cannot forget growth, because if we straightjacket our state budgets through unbending rules, while also requiring rigorous structural reforms, then, at the same time, we have to bring in measures to stimulate growth. Otherwise, in overall terms, Europe or many Member States risk falling into recession. Amidst all this, we cannot forget the relationship with our citizens and that is why, in the report by Ms Berès on the European Semester, we are asking for greater involvement from the national parliaments and from this House. That is because what this crisis has shown, above all in the search for responses, is precisely the lack of unity and political leadership and the democratic deficit with our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pt">() The aim of the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination was to introduce a way of synchronising European and national economic and financial policies. Today, any effort to conceptualise the political world that attempts to explain the current reality will tend to point to a ‘web-like political reality’ or, rather, ‘polyarchical’ power and webs of ‘interconstitutionality’. The purpose of this is to explain how the decisions made by one political player have an impact on all the others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The real issue is therefore to determine to what extent democratic legitimacy can be brought to bear at a time when traditional decision-making procedures no longer appear to be offering a suitable response. Therefore, while it is no longer possible to preserve the traditional concept of sovereignty, which, in practice, would be profoundly unrealistic, it is still possible to secure the concurrence of powers and to involve the national parliaments and the European Parliament, which are directly legitimised institutions, as fellow players. If not, political power will lose a significant part of its legitimacy, which will jeopardise the basic choices that need to be made. I voted in favour, since I believe the report addresses these issues.</p>

Nine committees drafted opinions which are well reflected in the final text as the rapporteur decided to vote most of them in a chapter called ‘sectoral contributions to the European Semester’. More than 350 amendments were tabled in ECON. In order to avoid the ‘left-right’ clash of the economic governance package, Ms Berès opted for a smart and inclusive process of negotiation which led to a good outcome. Most key Green amendments (47) survived through the negotiation process, including the following very good elements: - The EP commits to organise a public hearing to hold a dialogue based on the ‘comply or explain’ principle with the Commission and the Council at which the recommendations from the Commission, and the changes introduced by the Council, would be discussed. - The report emphasises that the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States and the broad economic guidelines both form integral parts of the European Semester and are equally important for the achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

      <p sl="fr">In May 2010, the Commission proposed the introduction of a semester of stricter budgetary surveillance. This process has been in force since January 2011. The objective of the European Semester is to strengthen coordination between Member States and European institutions while the budget lines for the following year are still at the draft stage. In particular, it is about ensuring that national budgets are fully compatible, firstly, with the stability or convergence programmes presented a few months earlier and, secondly, with the economic guidelines laid down at European level. During those six months (January to July), the budgetary and structural policies of Member States will be reviewed, on the basis of the information they provide, in order to identify any possible inconsistencies or signs of imbalance. I supported this resolution on the first European Semester because it calls for, among other things, increased parliamentary control of euro area governance at national and European level alike.

This procedure was introduced in the wake of the economic crisis that emerged largely as a result of excessive debt.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we are at the epicentre of the biggest economic crisis in the history of the EU, and we can be quite sure that the European Semester is not enough to restore the confidence of financial markets or to restore growth. It is obvious that it must be followed up with more measures, which we eagerly await. At the moment, in the first year of the European Semester, it is difficult to predict whether this instrument will perform its function. Although more and more Member States are implementing the Commission’s recommendations, such as raising the pension age, facilitating access to capital and using public procurement to stimulate the economy, we still lack determination and coordination at European level. We must hope that, along with a streamlined European Semester, future solutions for the coordination of EU economic policy, which we expect soon following the December summit, will deliver the expected results and contribute to Europe’s rapid recovery from the debt crisis.</p>

      <p sl="hu">During the crisis, it has become clear to all of us that the EU must engage in stricter budgetary control. Accordingly, under the European Semester, our principal aim is to coordinate Member State budgetary and economic policies in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the Europe 2020 economic strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The most important task ahead of us now is to create an instrument for the prevention of future public debt crises which is effective at Community level. However, a vital prerequisite of this is the introduction of stricter sanctions. The greatest merit of the legislative ‘six-pack’ drafted during the Hungarian Presidency is that it gave priority to keeping state expenditures in check, and to the importance of the debt criterion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Increased coordination of Member State economic policies is a necessary but insufficient condition of recovery from the crisis. In order for us to be able to manage the consequences of the recession and establish a sustainable economic policy, we must, in any event, pursue stricter budgetary control. Hungary has already embarked on this path. Unfortunately, my country is among the most indebted in Europe. The extreme amount of state debt we currently have is a result of irresponsible management by previous socialist governments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to put an end to the indebtedness of the country once and for all, Hungary has adopted provisions at constitutional level on responsible budgetary management and a state debt limit this year.</p>

The economic and financial crisis has made some Member States cut public expenditure and investment in areas which are essential to Europe’s citizens, such as health and education. I regard it as important that both the Commission and the Council ensure that sustainable, inclusive growth is at the heart of all the policy proposals made as part of the European Semester, along with employment and job creation. The measures adopted as part of the national reform plans, aimed at implementing economic governance and the European Semester, must not exacerbate the social crisis. I advocate that the recommendations from the Commission and Council must be mainly focused on a social policy conducive to education and vocational training, access to employment, the reintegration of the unemployed into the labour market and better coordination of Member States’ social welfare systems. Furthermore, the EU must consolidate the internal market and remove the barriers preventing workers’ mobility within the EU.

We will mark an important event in 2012 – the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the single market, and it is therefore important to know and understand how the single market will develop in the future and what the concerns and expectations of participants in the single market are. In October this year, the Single Market Forum, organised at the initiative of the Commission and the Polish Presidency, showed that there are still many legal and administrative obstacles to the smooth functioning of the single market.

I welcome the fact that the resolution calls for the completion of the digital single market and for remaining technical barriers to cross-border trade and service provision to be overcome, in particular, by improving the mutual recognition of electronic IDs, electronic signatures and electronic documents.

This ignores a basic fact: in the actual conditions under which this process of integration is taking place, the opportunities referred to really have arisen for some people, while, for others, they have remained mere promises, endlessly postponed, and have turned into nightmares.</p>

Free-market competition has made life easy for the sections of society that wield economic and financial power, but has aggravated unemployment, increased the rate of bankruptcy among countless small and medium-sized enterprises, and done nothing to improve the day-to-day lives of the general population, as the present crisis is making plain. It is for these reasons that, on being presented with such a picture as this resolution puts before us, our only response can be to protest against the pressure being exerted here to entrench the single market yet further, which the rhetoric of ‘consultation’ and ‘participation’ essentially does nothing to change.</p>

Consequently, I believe that the Commission must draw up and adopt a charter of citizens’ rights setting out citizens’ rights and obligations in the single market. This charter would be addressed to all citizens moving, working, buying and selling at cross-border level.

In 2012, we are even going to organise a ‘Single Market Week’ across all countries in the Union. In these times of economic crisis and uncertainty, it is more necessary than ever to give fresh impetus to the single market. To achieve this, the gap between what Europeans expect of the single market and what they actually get out of it will need to be bridged (let us remember, in this context, citizens’, consumers’ and SMEs’ lack of knowledge regarding their rights, obligations and opportunities in the single market).

A large proportion of HIV infections remain undiagnosed; many people do not know their serostatus and there is a relatively high likelihood that they will discover it only once they are affected by HIV/AIDS-related illnesses.

Levels of access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services differ significantly between Member States. Social exclusion and discrimination resulting from HIV status, as well as the silence and denial surrounding the infection and the failure to respect the basic human rights of people living with HIV and those belonging to vulnerable groups, persist and continue to undermine HIV prevention, care and treatment, and increase the impact of the epidemic on individuals, families, communities and countries.

I think, however, that the approach taken in Parliament’s resolution is not exhaustive and it does not give the right level of attention to the vulnerability of women to this illness. The number of women with HIV in Europe is constantly increasing: women account for some 35% of new diagnoses, in fact. Various studies have also shown that women are doubly at risk of infection through unprotected relations compared with men, which is due in equal measure to cultural restrictions and to women’s greater biological vulnerability.

Indeed, prompt treatment can reduce the patient’s infectivity and cut the rate of HIV transmission up to 96%. Prevention and information are still the cornerstones of suitable and effective health care to protect patients. I also see this resolution in light of the specific context of defending the right to health of the immigrant population, whom must be guaranteed the best possible level of assistance and treatment. We must remember that the UNAIDS 2011 Report claims that 68% of the global population affected by HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, the starting point for substantial flows of immigrants heading towards Europe. Furthermore, migration often means that migrants become marginalised and exposed to a higher risk of contracting infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Hence, it is important to ensure universal and equal access to prevention, detection tests, treatment and support for people affected by HIV, as well as treatment for co-infections including tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although there is a slight decrease of new HIV infections on a global scale, the numbers in the EU and neighbouring countries are still rising. According to estimates, almost 30% of European HIV-positive people are totally unaware of their status, resulting in their 3.5 times higher probability of transmitting the virus. Additionally, half of the infected prove to be late for care and progress to late stages of the infection before even being diagnosed. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS and current prevention options – such as condoms and abstinence – have proven inadequate in handling the risks that those women face, who are married, want children or are exposed to sexual violence. The four-year action plan of the Commission to reduce new HIV infection throughout Europe must be fully implemented, with special regard to improving access to prevention, treatment and care as well as improving the life conditions of those already infected by HIV. In a broader perspective, universal access to health care, as well as to STD and HIV/AIDS-related prevention, care and support must be facilitated and key populations must be involved in the design, implementation and monitoring.</p>

The progress made is attributable, in particular, to the wider-scale use of antiretroviral drugs. This is precisely why the Commission must continue to use every opportunity available as part of the research and development framework programme to identify funding for promising projects promoting HIV/AIDS research and the development of new antiretroviral drugs, vaccines and innovative microbicides.

The only cause for celebration is that society’s efforts in the struggle against HIV/AIDS have borne fruit, and a reduction of nearly 20% in the number of cases of new infections during the last decade has been achieved, and similarly, the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen in recent years. Above all, I believe that it is important to emphasise a stronger focus on prevention because it is infinitely most costly to deal with consequences, and not only in financial terms.

This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.</p>

The European Neighbourhood Policy makes provision for the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes to the participation of neighbouring countries with the objective of promoting reforms, modernisation and, in many cases, democratisation within them. Ukraine’s political and state leadership has repeatedly demonstrated Ukraine’s intention, in the medium term, to join the EU, notwithstanding the fact that it was condemned by this Parliament on 11 October for the trial and sentencing of the former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. In addition to implementing a package of public administration reforms, Ukraine has actively participated in the creation and work of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly – the platform for cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of the EU’s eastern neighbours. Furthermore, the new generation of Ukrainians have strong pro-European ambitions.

Ukraine’s political and state leadership has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to European integration and its long-term ambition to enable Ukraine to become an EU Member State, and considers an association agreement to be a key instrument in achieving this objective. Ukraine’s European perspective must be based on a policy of systematic and irreversible reforms in a number of key institutional, political, economic and social areas. The framework afforded by the association agreement will provide Ukraine with a crucial modernisation tool and a road map for steering internal domestic reforms, as well as a tool for national reconciliation, which will help the country to overcome the recent negative trends, bridge existing cleavages in Ukrainian society and unite it in its goal in relation to its European perspective, on the basis of the values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and good governance.</p>

The EU must remain steadfast in upholding its values and principles, which is why the association agreement should represent a real window of economic and commercial opportunity for Ukraine.

In addition to the mutual economic benefits, the conclusion of this agreement should help Ukraine to make progress in becoming a democratic State that is based on the rule of law and which guarantees citizens’ fundamental rights. Democracy involves complex requirements that go beyond the right to vote and respect for elections.

This mysterious outburst therefore leaves some doubt over whether he will attend. At a historic moment when the Ukrainian Government and the EU could sign an association agreement with which the EU would grant Ukraine the status of favoured partner, as enjoyed by Iceland, Switzerland and Norway, Mr Yanukovych seems to want to play hard to get. I would like Parliament to reflect on this lack of involvement from the party that should have the greatest interest in attending the summit. News of the Ukrainian Head of State’s attendance at the Eurasian summit would be tantamount to an insult orchestrated by the presidential administration to raise the stakes with the EU in the final days of negotiations prior to the entry into force of the association agreement: namely, an assessment of a request from Ukraine to join the EU in the next 10 years.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The customs union is one of the most important foundations for the free movement of goods, economic development and growth in the internal market. Customs play an important role in safeguarding the EU’s financial interests, as the importation into the EU of counterfeit and pirated goods leads to a loss in revenue and violates intellectual property rights, and counterfeit products can pose serious risks to the health and safety of European consumers. Customs today face increasing volumes of import, export and transit transactions while resources remain limited, and it is therefore important to ensure an efficient and effective management of customs procedures. I agree that the Modernised Customs Code adopted in 2008 is very important to improving the current situation and ensuring a smooth, simple and well-functioning customs system. I believe e-customs, in particular, centralised customs clearance, is one of the main aspects of customs modernisation and simplification for strengthening the EU’s economic competitiveness and developing reliable trade relations with third countries.</p>

I should emphasise the need to adapt the system to current requirements. This means that a differentiation must be made between the transit of perishable and non-perishable goods. Ensuring that the European market is supplied in a timely and safe manner is a priority nowadays for the EU. At the same time, the principle of proportionality must be observed with respect to the measures adopted by national authorities. An effective customs system is vital for the development of intellectual property rights, as emphasised in point 22. It also provides the transparency required for SMEs’ current activities, thereby facilitating economic growth. In Romania, one of the reform’s main objectives was to root out corruption in the customs service. This provides the basis for Romania joining the Schengen area, in addition to the restructuring of the border police.</p>

Putting into practice the idea of centralised customs clearance, which will enable companies to notify goods electronically and make payments from their own office, may dramatically simplify customs procedures. Drafting an appropriate customs strategy, which is one of the priorities of the Member States, is also key for European competitiveness. It will help improve the protection of intellectual property rights and the fight against illegal imports of goods or counterfeit products. Another important matter relates to security issues, in terms of eliminating both imports of life-threatening materials and illegal immigration via freight transport.

The Modernised Customs Code (MCC) adopted in 2008 plays a crucial role in simplifying European Union customs procedures and harmonising customs rules, and thus helps economic actors to work more efficiently and customs authorities to operate more effectively. However, the MCC cannot come into operation until the information systems have been put in place and/or developed. Consequently, progress so far suggests that the deadline for implementation (set for 24 June 2013) will not be met. However, I agree that it would be appropriate to delay the implementation of the MCC, since the great majority of Member States and trade representatives are in favour of this option.

An effective customs policy plays a key role in protecting intellectual property rights, combating the illegal entry of goods and counterfeit products into the single market, and therefore enhances safety and security for European consumers.

The Modernised Customs Code, aimed at simplifying customs procedures and harmonising customs regulations, was adopted in 2008, with the deadline for implementation being 24 June 2013.

Since its creation, the Customs Union has been expanded both quantitatively – from 6 to 27 members, and qualitatively by becoming a Single Market. It has contributed to prosperity in Europe by facilitating trade both within the Union and with third countries. Today’s customs are facing a rapidly changing environment: evolving production and consumption patterns, increasing international trade, global threats such as terrorism, organised crime, climate change and new hazards like trade in dangerous goods. It is in precisely this context that the customs authorities of the EU play a key role. Their mission is to ensure at all times the balance between protecting society and facilitating trade through the control of the supply chain, at the external border as well as within the EU. I believe it is important to try to make an effort to modernise customs working methods, whereby the overarching objective is to maintain the pivotal position of customs authorities as a modern, responsive partner to trade, protecting the fiscal, consumer and security interests of the Union, cooperating with other government agencies, and, at the same time, being equipped to respond to crisis and new public policy demands.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report provides an opportunity to underline the crucial and multifaceted role of the customs authorities. They are, in fact, responsible for the day-to-day safety of goods and persons; they have to ensure compliance with intellectual property rights, health regulations, immigration rules, product safety, and so on. Moreover, they do all this without impeding freedom of movement within the European Union. I must, however, highlight one problem common to customs authorities in the Member States: the lack of resources. Let us be realistic: we cannot ask them to guard the fort and to deal with every single situation, while at the same time reducing their financial and human resources. This is why I would like to increase customs cooperation and funding, so as to support their efforts to switch to electronic procedures and streamline inspections. That is the price that we have to pay in order to ensure effective and satisfactory protection for our citizens and our businesses.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report by Matteo Salvini because it quite rightly identifies the need to modernise customs in Europe. Competitiveness in the economic sector in Europe is vitally important, especially if we are to revive the internal market. The customs sector plays an important role in improving and influencing competitiveness and simplifying customs legislation and promoting e-customs will stimulate the economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to explain my vote in favour of the report on the modernisation of customs, because this is an important and much-needed text that enables the Commission to postpone the entry into force of a regulation adopted in 2008 and slated for implementation in 2013. Our delegation would have preferred to purge the text of references to the non-preferential origin principle, which we do not support, has nothing to do with the text of the report, and which we will fight if it is put forward again during the debate on the legislative proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report on modernising customs because I think we need to simplify customs legislation in order to improve and influence competitiveness. Customs play an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks and contributing, above all, to the fight against fraud. This, however, requires efficient IT systems so as to ensure product safety and to block the sale of less safe products. However, I did vote against the parts referring to non-preferential origin of goods, not because I do not support the principle, but because I think the reference to the definition of the product origin should not be in this report, which aims to establish criteria for improving customs competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="it">An efficient Customs Union is one of the essential cornerstones of the European integration process and a basis for the free movement of goods, economic development and growth in the internal market. The EU’s Modernised Customs Code, which was adopted in 2008, is highly ambitious in terms of deadlines, but the new proposal must aim at genuinely improving the current situation, bringing clear added value for EU operators and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. We need to step up the fight against breaches of customs regulations and against the threats posed by smuggling, organised crime, corruption, terrorism and other criminal acts. These goals can be reached by paying particular attention to implementing the recommendations of the World Customs Organisation on risk management, the protection and security of legal trade, developing partnerships with business in the area of customs automation, and on the fight against corruption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The competitiveness of the European Union is of huge importance, especially at the present moment, with the prospect of revitalising the European single market. Customs systems have a significant part to play in this, namely by simplifying customs legislation and upgrading its electronic and digital component. However, if the customs procedures of the Member States are indeed to contribute to improving European competitiveness, then modernisation and greater cooperation, plus action and responsibility, must go hand in hand with guarantees of security and efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the modernisation of customs as this service has a crucial role in guaranteeing safety and security, protecting consumers and the environment, ensuring complete revenue collection, strengthening the fight against fraud and corruption, and ensuring respect for intellectual property rights. A practical, simple and effective customs system is vital for facilitating the movement of goods and trade on the internal market, especially for SMEs, An effective customs policy plays a key role in ensuring the safety and security of European consumers. The customs service today faces increasing volumes of import, export and transit transactions, and e-customs is one of the main aspects for modernising and simplifying the customs service. I think that modernising the EU’s customs strategy and customs instruments should be a high political priority, supported by an ample budget. We welcome the Commission’s initiative to promote the adoption of e-invoicing at EU level, a measure which will help simplify transactions and reduce tax fraud. We call on the Commission to submit to the European Parliament by June 2012 a report on the current status of compliance by Member States with EU customs legislation, including an action plan to rectify any shortcomings identified.</p>

      <p sl="en">This resolution calls on Member States to take action to modernise customs procedures across the EU. In particular, this report calls for serious action to be taken to combat illegal imports. Greater cooperation between customs authorities in all Member States will combat the trade in illegal and counterfeit goods, and ensure greater product safety and protection of intellectual property rights across the EU. A seamless and harmonised application of EU customs legislation throughout the EU will enhance the competitiveness of EU firms, but MEPs pointed out that customs controls should primarily target high-risk consignments to reduce the burden and cost on importers and customs authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">The revision of the 2008 Customs Code is intended, above all, to simplify customs procedures. Modern customs practices ensure legal certainty and protect intellectual property, while also providing mechanisms to combat fraud and to ensure the security of international supply chains. The implementing provisions for the Modernised Customs Code have not yet come into force and the rapporteur recommends extending the deadline in order to take account of IT developments. I voted in favour.</p>
