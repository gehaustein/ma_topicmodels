      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have a couple of questions to put to you and to the Secretary-General of this House. I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began. I take it as read that it was of an appropriately dignified character, and do not indeed doubt that it was, for I see the occasion, and the need for such a ceremony, as important.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr Rømer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever. I do not know whether the members or chairmen of other groups were informed of it, but I, in any case, was not. When I, last Thursday, asked the Secretary-General and you how this had been prepared, I was told – for you left the answer to the Secretary-General – that it had been done in close cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and, that appearing to be to be an acceptable explanation, I declared myself content with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since then, I have learned that neither the deputy chairman of that committee, Mr Lambrinidis – who is a member of my group – nor my group’s coordinator, Mrs Roure, had had any word whatever of this event.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think this House has earned the right to be allowed to take part in an event of this kind, and I would have been happy to be present in my capacity as a group chairman. I do not think it helpful that Parliamentary business or initiatives of this kind should be staged in this building without Members of this House being present, and so I ask that, the next time events of this kind – which are, as I have said, useful – are prepared and held, a better job should be made of it.</p>

    <intervention id="1-007" speaker_id="1253" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">I personally, as President of this House, took it as read that the procedure would be the same as it was last year; we will check to see if something different was done then. I myself presided from 3 p.m. onwards and wanted to do so until half past three, but the sitting then dragged on longer as the young people – whom it was very nice to see there, may I say – and the group chairmen were not so punctilious in keeping to their speaking time, and the President was not in a position to tell the young people to stop speaking after four minutes, so that I myself was unable to keep a very important appointment at half past three.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The whole thing lasted until just before 4 p.m. The sitting had been chaired before 3 p.m. by Mr Cavada, the chairman of this House’s home affairs committee; the rapporteur was Mr Sifunakis, who is a member of your group, and Commissioner Špidla was also present. What I would recommend is that we should check to compare what was done last time and what was done this year. As for next year, I would ask – and I am grateful to you for saying how very useful you, too, find this – that we should try for a bit more transparency next time around, but there is one thing that will not be possible, for the Chamber was packed out with 580 young people in it, and if we invite all the Members of this House, there will not be enough space. We should, though, give some thought to how this House can be properly represented through the political groups. Can we agree on that?</p>

  <section id="creitem3" title="3. Statement by the President">
    <intervention id="1-009" speaker_id="1253" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Perhaps I might make a comment to the topic we have just discussed. Yesterday – Sunday, March the eleventh – was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004, when 192 people were killed. The day of this appalling event has become a European day of commemoration for the victims of terrorism. It is a day for keeping memory alive – the memory of the victims of terrorism – and for solidarity with them and their families, with those who lost their lives and also with those who still suffer the effects of it, whether physical or psychological.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is a day for fostering awareness, for, following the attack on Madrid, the bombings in London on 7 July 2005 resulted in more victims within the European Union, and, elsewhere around the world, too, it is still too often the case that too many people are being killed by violence motivated by fanaticism. Terrorism is an attack on freedom and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt at making things happened through blind violence and, in the process, destroying values, the values that are the foundation of the European Union and its Member States. Terrorism is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. It represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community and is also a direct assault on our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Union and the international community of states must be determined in fighting terrorism in whatever shape or form. There can be no justification for terrorism, and, in fighting it, we can allow ourselves no weakness; that is why we need a strong and united Europe. If we are to fight it effectively, we need to go beyond mere close cooperation and develop a coherent common policy that meets the needs of the public while also reflecting our understanding of human rights and human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Let me, then, say once more that this House does not see Guantanamo as compatible with our European legal order, and that we must ensure, in joining together to fight terrorism in Europe, that we do so in a manner consistent with the values that we are defending.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On the occasion of this day commemorating the victims of terrorism, we must again declare ourselves willing to fight terrorism in whatever form and also to take the action needed in order to do so. We must not forget the victims of terrorism; the punishment of their murderers is a debt we owe to them, but a determined policy must also have the object of preventing, in so far as possible, terrorism and terrorist acts on European Union soil and anywhere else in the world, in line with the principles of the international community and our system of law.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 5 March this year, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, an Italian journalist and Afghanistan correspondent for the newspaper ‘La Repubblica’, was abducted by the Taliban. He was simply doing his job, which was to report on the situation in that country. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing this House’s solidarity and my own with Mr Mastrogiacomo’s family and with the newspaper ‘La Repubblica’.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would also like, speaking on behalf of this House, to express the same solidarity with the German citizen and her son, both of whom were abducted in Iraq in February. We urge and demand of the persons who are holding Mr Mastrogiacomo and the organisation Kataib Siham al-Haq, which abducted the two German citizens and long-term residents of Iraq, that they should let these people go free – free and unharmed – without delay. We must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by violence.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I now ask that we remember the victims of terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 March 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated. It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Monday:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has moved that there be no motions to close the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Community measures to provide cross-border health services. Who wishes to justify this motion?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-023" speaker_id="4429" name="Robert Goebbels" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my group believes that this proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to submit an oral question with debate and resolution on the provision of cross-border health care is inappropriate for the simple reason that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, backed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, is currently debating a draft report that relates to the same subject, namely health services in the European Union. The vote on this resolution is in danger of being redundant and, above all, is in danger of cutting short the debates taking place in the two other committees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group could therefore just about endorse the presentation of this oral question with debate, but it requests that the resolution be left in abeyance and dealt with at the same time as the report by the committee concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">According to the information I have, this report is scheduled for the May plenary session. Let us therefore avoid any duplication of effort and let us try to do some serious parliamentary work. In other words, let us wait for the background report by the committee concerned to become available.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-024" speaker_id="1913" name="Evelyne Gebhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I can, in fact, do no more than repeat what my colleague Mr Goebbels has already said. We, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, are currently drafting a comprehensive report, which will also include opinions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would, of course, be good if our committee’s ongoing work were not to be prejudiced by the adoption of a resolution that had to be cobbled together within the space of three days, whereas we have been spending many weeks preparing a good document that, it is to be hoped, will enjoy broad support. I think the sensible thing to do would be to have a debate on this – that is something we can certainly accept – while not adopting a resolution on it.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-025" speaker_id="4527" name="John Bowis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I understand the courteous and moderate way in which the request has been put by the colleagues opposite, but I have to say that I think it is based on a misunderstanding. I am grateful for their support. However, we are not talking about two debates on the same issue, but about a report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which is not yet completed, concerning the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive. An opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is winging its way to that committee and, in due course, we shall have a full debate on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution is not about services but about patients.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">It is about the consequences for patients of the judgments of the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">When colleagues say that this debate might be untimely, they are right because it is very late. This resolution was not cobbled together in three days but was put together by the Committee on the Environment last December, when it was carried unanimously by that committee. The Health Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou, told us on numerous occasions that he was waiting for the resolution and asked why he could not have it because he knew that it had been carried. Therefore, it is long overdue. It is quite separate from the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we will give that due respect when it comes. However, for now, I ask Parliament to agree that the oral question should be accompanied by the resolution, which did not come before us in January or February, but surely can now do so in March.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the report held in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 24 January was split down the middle: of the 43 members present, 22 voted in favour, 15 voted against and 6 abstained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Due mainly to the fact that it focuses on GMOs, when biotechnology is far broader in scope, this report, which is entitled ‘Biotechnology: prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe’, has provoked numerous reactions, and not only within our group.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For that reason, and due to the ensuing risk of this report – which is fairly crucial for a subject as important as biotechnology – failing, it would be helpful if the report were referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development so that it can re-examine it and perhaps arrive at a more balanced proposal that receives more votes. I would add that I met Mr Virrankoski to discuss this issue – I am grateful to him for the constructive meeting that we had last week – and that it seems, moreover, that my fellow coordinator, Mr Busk, shares this opinion, if the e-mail that he sent me is anything to go by.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-028" speaker_id="2306" name="Kyösti Virrankoski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, biotechnology offers massive opportunities for European agriculture, although it presents challenges for it as well. For this reason, a report such as this cannot be treated as a yes or no issue: instead, it needs to be examined thoroughly and without bias. Accordingly, I am in favour of it being referred back to the committee so that we might get the greatest possible support for it in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I ask that this debate on hunting in Malta be concluded without a resolution because I feel that such a resolution is unnecessary and unjustified, and for three reasons. Firstly, spring hunting is, in itself, illegal, its being through the use of a derogation that European law allows the practice of hunting at this time of year. Secondly, the use of a derogation to allow spring hunting was the specific subject of negotiations between Malta and the European Union in the period prior to accession, and there is therefore no reason why this chapter should be re-opened. Thirdly, if spring hunting is to be abolished, then this should be done on a scientific basis and not in response to political pressure.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-031" speaker_id="28122" name="David Casa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="mt">I agree with my colleague, Mr Busuttil. I believe that we are talking in this case about an agreement between the European Union and Malta, approved by both Parliament and the majority of the Maltese and Gozitan population of my country. I believe that it is at this stage unnecessary to come up with a resolution that goes against what was decided on between the Maltese people and the European Union, because I feel that we would in that way be sending out the wrong message to every European citizen, namely that the very European Union that originally endorses an agreement tries to put a stop to it after a while. I therefore believe that this is not the time for a resolution on the matter.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-032" speaker_id="4254" name="Monica Frassoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we asked for and accepted this debate and why a resolution is needed is precisely because Malta has failed to abide by the agreements. It is obvious that that is what the problem is. Otherwise a resolution would not have been put forward; we would not have received the results and the very explicit recommendations of a fact-finding mission sent to Malta; and the Commission would not have recommended, as my fellow Members are very well aware, that the Maltese Government should not authorise the spring hunt in the country this year, in view of what has happened in previous years.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reason, therefore, why we are calling for a debate and resolution is exactly the opposite of what my fellow Members maintain: since there is a violation of Community law and since we must apparently legislate less, we had better concern ourselves with applying this law. I hope this House will act in accordance with the decision made earlier and draw up a resolution on this topic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, starting the agenda in this way with a brief debate on the Berlin statement is a good choice. If the declaration is worth anything, let it be debated briefly and early in the morning, rather than at the end of a long and perhaps rather problematic debate on the Council, with different groups pulling in different directions. I think it is certainly appropriate that we should first have an hour’s worth of debate on the Berlin statement, followed by an exhaustive one on the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have seen that World Women’s Day was marked in Iran by demonstrations by women, which were then violently suppressed. Over recent weeks, pressure on women’s organisations in Iran generally has increased, and it is for that reason that we think it more relevant and more a matter of urgency that this be debated rather than the subject in relation to Nigeria.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, although I am sure that Mr Gahler is right to say that this is an important problem and one that we should not disregard, I do nevertheless believe that we should not drop the subject of Nigeria in favour of something else.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I would propose is that we leave Nigeria on the agenda and take the subject of women in Iran during the next part-session in Brussels, for example in the format of a brief oral question to the Commission or the Council as to what they envisage doing in order to support women in that country. We would be happy to agree to that, but this time we should leave the agenda as it is. In that sense, I am against the motion, but would offer the opportunity for an in-depth discussion of the issue at another time – that time being in the course of the next part-session.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, excessive charges for our mobile telephones, according to recent statistics, have increased in the unrestrained competitive race between the companies. The biggest loser in this specific scenario is the citizen. Commissioner Reding and the Committee on Culture and Education were therefore right to decide to put an end, with a regulation, to excessive mobile telephone charges in the Member States, by calling for a reduction in charges in all European countries, with a standard charge for roaming calls.</p>
      <p sl="el">The citizens of Spain, in a show of protest about roaming charges, recently decided to stage a boycott by not using their telephones on a certain day. Their action was successful. It was the only method of protest to make the companies understand that they cannot keep behaving in this way towards consumers, when profits have been increasing exponentially over recent years. It was the first positive reaction and we, as the European Parliament, are obliged to support it and, at the same time, to welcome the decisiveness of the Spanish citizens. Their example must be followed by other citizens in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you will recall that I recently wrote you a letter. Thank you for the speed and the positive nature of your response. One of the items I raised with you was the fact that, in view particularly of the summit that has just taken place and the emphasis on climate change, it is important that the European Parliament set an example and set out a strategy for itself to be carbon neutral, because it is difficult for us to tell other people how to behave if we do not have our own house in order.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was delighted to read in your response that the new Secretary-General will be drawing up a proposal to make Parliament carbon neutral. I should like to urge that he proceed with all possible speed to reinforce the success of the spring Council meeting on climate change and, in particular, that he look at the specific difficulties we have in relation to the three places of work and how we can become carbon neutral in that context.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In 1848, a series of democratic civil revolutions swept through Europe, creating the values that are the foundation of today’s modern European community. Europe’s peoples fought for civil rights, for free elections, for independent national parliaments, in short for constitutions guaranteeing all of the above.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Budapest commemorates that revolution this week, on 15 March. This is our greatest national holiday, which we would like to celebrate in dignity. Tragic events in the course of last fall’s anti-government demonstrations and during the celebrations of the 1956 uprising, brutal police actions against peaceful civilian demonstrators, prompt me to issue a call from this European Parliament to the Hungarian Government to allow a dignified, peaceful commemoration and to remove the illegal barriers erected four months ago from around the Hungarian Parliament building.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, I call upon the Minister of Public Security to respect Hungarian citizens’ fundamental rights, as requested by Commissioner Frattini, and to refrain from intimidating those who are peacefully celebrating, from using life-threatening rubber bullets and other weapons that cause serious injuries and from all violent interventions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this past weekend, documents were passed to the German magazine ‘Spiegel’ demonstrating, or claiming to make clear, that the Leipzig energy exchange had been manipulated. The reactions to that news in Germany have, understandably, been very lively, but a European response is also called for.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe’s energy exchanges are interlinked, and if prices have been artificially pushed up on the one in Leipzig, that also has effects in the other countries, and so I urge the Commission to be proactive in dealing with these accusations, which have to do with the credibility of the European internal market in energy, and which are also of interest to the consumers who may well have lost out to the tune of billions of euros.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to draw your attention to the question of translation and interpreting services. The quality of translations and interpreting is not adequate, and I have enquired why. It appears that, in our office, instead of recruiting permanent translators and interpreters, the translation and interpreting section has begun to engage many temporary employees. Thus translation and interpreting quality requirements have been lowered. Explanations are offered that this is in order to save money; however, for four months now I have been trying to dispense with interpreters in those committees where I am the only representative from my country, but I have not succeeded. I would consider that all of this points to the fact that there are management problems in the translation and interpreting service, and I would very much like to ask the Working Group that has been formed to implement reforms in Parliament to consider the question of quality of management in the translation and interpreting service during their deliberations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as many MEPs are aware, elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly took place last week. The overwhelming majority of the 108 members of this new assembly supported the creation of a devolved government in Northern Ireland on 26 March next. Dr Ian Paisley and the DUP secured a political mandate from voters for the policies that he is presently pursuing. I would urge Dr Paisley and his party to take the final historic step and form a devolved government in two weeks’ time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament has always supported the peace process in Northern Ireland and will, I hope, continue to do so. This has been with the support given by the European Union to programmes such as the Interreg cross-border initiative, the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and the International Fund for Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 24 March 2007, we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Union. This is a celebration of a very successful political project whereby European leaders put aside their differences and chose the path of peace, as opposed to the path of war. It would be very symbolic indeed if a new government in Northern Ireland could be formed two days after these Europe-wide celebrations, as this would mark a very important step in building peace and reconciliation amongst all the people in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has named today European Commemoration Day for the Victims of Terrorism. We must never forget those people who have died or been injured at the hands of terrorists, be it in Ireland, Europe or other parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was both interested and shocked to read the findings of a report last week which show that, since 2002, the total time allocated to physical education in European schools has declined steadily. Indeed, my own country, Ireland, ranks as one of the poorest with a minimum curriculum guideline of 30 minutes and a maximum of just 60 minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Childhood obesity is on the rise across Europe. Indeed, obesity is five times more common now than it was after World War II. In Ireland alone 300 000 children are either overweight or obese according to the Department of Health and Children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obesity in our children today will cost society massively in the long run, from both an economic and a social perspective. In terms of direct cost, obesity accounts for up to six per cent of Ireland’s total healthcare costs. Obesity is directly linked to many serious illnesses such as type-two diabetes, heart disease, stroke, high blood-pressure and certain types of cancer.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this in mind, surely it is time for the EU to give impetus to change by promoting a realistic and effective strategy in this field, which can be benchmarked by Member States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It was with no small joy, indeed with a sense of vindication that I took part on 1 March with my colleague Kinga Gál, as representatives of the EP, in the inauguration of the Fundamental Rights Agency. Although opinions of the political elite were divided all along on this matter, in the end, we succeeded in creating a body within the European Union to deal professionally with human rights. The merit belongs in no small measure to the dedicated Vice-President Frattini, to the Presidency for its willingness to compromise, and last but not least, to our own Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The time has come for those who were sceptical until now to accept the existence of the Fundamental Rights Agency and give it their support in the future. And understand this: the political decision of the Council has made it possible, even if this is not in the law, to extend investigations to the third pillar, and thus to police cooperation as well.</p>

I would like therefore to point out, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency did not begin with the inaugural ceremonies. The real work is only now unfolding, as decisions are made about the plan, the work and about the team that will be chosen to lead this new Agency so that it may indeed fulfil the expectations set out for it by Europe, the European Parliament, my colleagues and myself as rapporteur. Indeed, the task of this Agency will be to pay attention to all the fundamental legal problems that exist in the old but especially in the new Member States, helping them to put into daily practice the basic principles of the EU, the principles of the rule of law.</p>

This is a victory for women, and we should point out that this Parliament has made a contribution to it. Deliberately and consciously paying women less is just one of the reasons why women in the European Union earn 15% less than men. There are other more hidden reasons: more women working part time, on temporary contracts, in lower paid sectors, more difficulty gaining access to positions of responsibility etc.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the year, the United States asked two EU Member States, Poland and the Czech Republic for permission to locate elements of a US anti-rocket defence mechanism in Europe. The initial announcements of the representatives of these countries left no room for doubt that this was to be a bilateral operation between the United States on the one side and Poland and the Czech Republic on the other. The EU’s high representative for the common foreign and security policy, Javier Solana, expressed the same view two weeks ago. I do not share this view and I believe that the same goes for the majority in Parliament. The presence of US anti-rocket bases on European territory does not affect only Czechs and Poles. It has a much broader reach. It affects relations between Europe and the United States, between the EU and NATO and between the EU and Russia.

      <p sl="el">I shall not comment on the major problem of pollution, except to quote one statistic: that over the last 15 years in the Mediterranean alone 55 000 tonnes of oil have been spilled as a result of various accidents at sea and have polluted the shores.</p>

Today protected areas in the Mediterranean total just 2%, while scientists are stressing that they should be 20%.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last week the European Union announced plans to phase out incandescent light bulbs by 2009. Europe currently consumes about two billion such bulbs per annum and simply does not have the manufacturing capability to make two billion alternative lamps. Demand would require about 300 new production lines – that is about 75 new production lines for each one of Europe’s four main lamp manufacturers. None of them currently has more than ten production lines. The cost of new machinery alone would be about GBP 450 million. If this undertaking is enforced, then the lamps will have to be sourced from elsewhere – probably China – if indeed it can meet the demand.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was an honour and a great responsibility for me to draw up the report on social services of general interest (SSGIs). My aim was to draft an initial report setting out, on the one hand, the broad outlines of my analysis and, on the other, the proposals on the subject. I sought the agreement not only of the parliamentary group of which I am a Member but also, on account of the report’s structure, style and overall approach, a broader agreement. In other words, this agreement was aimed not only at the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but also at the debate in the plenary of the European Parliament. It was also intended to obtain the support of the majority in the Council and in the Commission. I would also like the majority of social organisations, which helped me so much in drawing up this report, to view it as a useful instrument for legal clarification in the social sector and a means of giving fresh visibility and impetus to SSGIs at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In November, I wrote that the explanatory statement and report put forward were intended to help strengthen the social aspects of the process of European integration, guaranteeing the necessary legal certainty for social players and public authorities and ensuring financial transparency, the requisite compatibility with the internal market rules applicable and improvements in the quality of services provided in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, and taking account of the need to lend practical shape to the Lisbon Strategy in the social area. The latter therefore requires significant support from Parliament for this report and needs involvement from the social organisations at European level and relevant support in the Commission, the Council and in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report submitted for your vote today mentions a great many important issues for SSGIs to function appropriately. I should like to highlight the following: SSGIs are an appropriate means of strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy, of fulfilling the aims of the Social Agenda and addressing challenges such as globalisation, industrial change, demographic change, migration and changing social and employment patterns, thus contributing towards the development of a social Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this report, Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to respect the diversity of the methods of organising and managing SSGIs, of their resources and of the methods of funding these services. Parliament also points out that in some Member States the decentralisation of power, whereby regional or local authorities take greater control of providing SSGIs, was not accompanied by the budgetary resources needed for the appropriate level of service provision. Parliament therefore calls on the Member States to ensure the complete transfer of powers to the regional or local authorities so that the provision of SSGIs can be given the appropriate budgetary resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report also recommends the convocation of a forum, under the auspices of the European Parliament, which would bring together European social organisations and representatives of the Council and the Commission to guide the way this process is handled.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, this process will, with your support, make progress towards strengthening the EU and the social dimension of Europe. I feel that the political conditions are in place to ensure that the Commission, the Council, the social organisations and the Member States are closely involved in this process, and that businesses, the unions and the social partners also participate usefully and appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With our strong commitment, the necessary steps for the legal situation of SSGIs to be clarified precisely will certainly be taken, which, from my point of view, should be brought before Parliament at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am convinced that, starting this week, we will be able to move further down the road towards clarifying the role of the SSGIs and strengthening the EU’s social aspects.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Hasse Ferreira for this report and for his efforts in reaching a broad consensus. I am pleased that you have largely adopted the approach put forward by the Commission in its communication of April 2006. Parliament’s contribution to our discussions is very important in defining systematic access to social services of general interest (SSGIs). This approach should clarify compliance with the Community rules on SSGIs and contribute towards modernising these services within a fixed and predictable framework, which will in turn ensure and underpin their main social objectives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Mr Hasse Ferreira’s report especially highlights the vital role played by SSGIs as an important part of the European social model, the importance of these services to the Lisbon Strategy, the particular nature of SSGIs and the need to clarify the legal framework regarding these services so as to make it clearer and predictable. In this regard, I fully agree that this is not about implementing economic rules that conflict with the ideas of general interest and social cohesion. Our steps form part of the effort to achieve cooperation between the economic and social fields, as emphasised in the report. In the event of dispute, however, general interest must however prevail over the rules of the internal market and economic competition, as Commission President Barroso recently reminded Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report emphasises quality, both in terms of social services for individuals and in terms of employment in the sector. Parliament is rightly adamant on this point. We must, however, strike the right balance between the protection that service providers expect and the quality that the users and the bodies funding these services are rightly seeking. On this point, too, Mr Barroso has reminded us of the importance of every framework relating to services of general interest at European level being based on targets such as high quality, the right price/quality ratio and universal access.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission aims to launch this issue through consultation with the Member States and other interested parties. It will draw on the results of this consultation and also of course on Parliament’s views in determining the next steps. I will channel all my energies into securing the much-needed legal certainty and into enhancing the quality of social services, which will at the same time be compatible with the subsidiarity principle. In this spirit, the Commission is looking into the possibility of putting forward some draft legislation, as it indicated in its April 2006 communication.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am aware of Parliament’s call to have clear timescales for completing the consultation announced by the Commission. I can assure you that the consultation will be completed by the end of June. I also welcome Parliament’s initiative to put together a forum which will accompany this process. I will gladly represent the Commission at this forum.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, while I am, of course, speaking for my group, I speak primarily as the person who prepared the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can do no other than agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hasse Ferreira, and endorse what he has to say in his report to the effect that services of general interest are not only an important element in social and economic cohesion, but also make a considerable contribution to the competitiveness of the European economy, and this is particularly true of those services of general interest that are social in character.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not for me to evaluate Mr Hasse Ferreira’s proposals in detail, but I am duty bound to draw your attention once more to what we in this House formerly resolved on the basis of my own report on the White Paper on services of general interest. I can do no other than confirm that Mr Hasse Ferreira has taken on board what our committee has drafted on this subject, and has done so in a manner that we find satisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Services of general interest are meant to be of high quality, accessible and universally available, while also being rendered at optimum cost, respecting social balance and on the basis of lasting security of supply. While it goes without saying that services of general interest can be rendered under conditions of fair competition, the principle of equal treatment for private and public enterprises must at the same time apply, although the rules of the market must not impede the performance of public services, and this is best guaranteed by targeted measures and regulations specific to individual sectors, which will require an ongoing assessment of public services in the European Union in order to determine where proposals need to be worked out to address problem areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have already urged the Commission to do something about greater legal certainty in these areas and, where necessary, to draft a proposal for a sector-specific directive; all I can do at the present moment is to reiterate the need for that.</p>

I attempted to mark out an area for debate that was not just a straight copy of the area that characterised the Bolkestein directive. My group and I were opposed to that directive, since it aimed at commodifying services in general.</p>
      <p sl="it">While remaining opposed, I attempted to define what Europe requires of its social and citizenry services, considering that they should be universal, accessible to all, democratically managed and thus genuinely for the citizens; in other words, they are different from market services, and therefore require a different, separate legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="it">This opinion has the support of the Committee on the Environment and I believe it can also be of use in the context of the debate on the provision in general.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I am speaking at this sitting in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which approved the opinion by a large majority.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some of its content has been incorporated, either in spirit or more explicitly, into the report that Mr Hasse Ferreira has presented to us here this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to explain some of the ideas included in the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and some of the characteristics of what are known as social services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of these services unquestionably form part of what is known, broadly and in a manner that is difficult to define precisely, as the European social model, a model that they have helped to shape.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another aspect that everybody accepts is that these services must be fully subject to the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore for the States to define not just the field in which they are applied, but also the model and the system.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is another issue which I believe has been fully accepted, and that is that we are in a dynamic environment in which both the demands of society and, consequently, the incorporation of new social services, are constantly evolving and changing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to draw attention to the need also to make the provision of social services compatible with legal security and free competition.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must not forget that each State has different models for applying services. In the case of public services, social services must be guaranteed by public administrations, though it is not necessarily they who have to provide them directly.</p>
      <p sl="es">When private providers emerge, therefore, I believe that this Parliament and the Commission must be aware of the need, while respecting the specific characteristics of these social services of general interest — particularly in view of the jobs that they create — to guarantee the legal security of those service providers that wish to operate throughout the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="1-071" speaker_id="4293" name="Gabriele Stauner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs has tried, through in-depth debate, to be consistent in setting out the legal problems that the services directive throws up, not least in relation to health services, and on which the Commission will no doubt also have something to say. The lead committee – that on employment and social affairs – has largely taken our proposals on board, and for that I have to say that I am grateful. We saw it as important that we should put on record the considerable doubts in the Committee on Legal Affairs’s mind as to whether a European regulation can actually improve social services for the public where they are, and we have the same doubts as regards its efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, any regulation considered by the Commission must have an unambiguous legal basis, and we do not believe that Article 16 of the European Communities Treaty can serve as one in this instance, which is, in the Committee on Legal Affairs’ view, a classic example of where the subsidiarity principle should apply. At Member State level, social services take the most diverse forms, having developed in line with their own traditions and being funded in wholly different ways. Subsequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs decided that the subsidiarity principle meant that it was for the Member States alone to define what social services of general interest actually are, and this is another important point that was incorporated into the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">The obvious consequence of this is that the Commission cannot claim any right to lay down definitions by, for example, pointing to differing interpretations of concepts in the case law of the Court of Justice and elsewhere. I also want to draw the House’s attention to the contradiction between paragraphs 12 and 16 in the justification, of which we have taken note and which we have therefore not incorporated into the text of the report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, the question of public services is of key importance from the perspective of attaining the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, and moreover, no adequate solution can be found to our demographic challenges without a strategy for developing such services.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to stress two questions within this set of problems: the question of accessibility and that of quality. Since respect for human rights is a fundamental element of our expectations with respect to social services, no country is exempt from the obligation to tie these services and service-providers to appropriate authorisations and supervision. Those who make use of social services generally find themselves in a vulnerable position.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Another fundamental demand is that these services be accessible. Since the demographic crisis facing Europe cannot be resolved without an adequate social service network, we must emphasise that the financial burden for such services cannot be transferred exclusively to citizens, or even to the local authorities, who are carrying ever greater burdens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Our experience in the new Member States is that the spiralling indebtedness of local authorities is reaching frightening proportions, since they lack sufficient funds to cover the services and areas of competence that have been transferred to them by the State. The business sector cannot be expected to bear all the costs either, but the proposal that the burden be shared is worth considering, provided the business sector receives sufficient support and incentives, such as tax breaks.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The fact is that based on the principle of subsidiarity, this responsibility falls naturally within the Member States’ competence, but the sharing of good practices and a system of open coordination can undoubtedly be extremely useful in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is fundamentally important to ask ourselves what social services of general interest are, how they are organised in today’s society, and what role they play in developing a Europe of freedoms and solidarity. They are part of the European social model that the European Union wants to have, and a priority objective of the Lisbon Strategy. It all comes down to the complex relationship that has to be established between the individual, society and the State, which has to conform with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Social services of general interest must guarantee that every person has equal value and equal opportunities, while in practical terms ensuring the primacy of the individual over institutions and of civil society over political power. We must therefore eliminate any ambiguities and provide legal certainty, so as to develop a system of social services in Europe that meets people’s needs and makes the most of all the resources of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament is certainly the best place to conduct a thorough reflection on these issues. The report on which we are going to vote is the result of a compromise endorsed by a majority in this House. It is the starting point for a debate that looks expectantly to the legislative proposal that the Commission will be putting before us.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ferreira, for the constructive work he has done and for having succeeded in obtaining a broad majority in the committee for his proposal. Social services of general interest were excluded from the Services Directive. There was a reason for this. They are of a quite special character that differs from that of commercial services and were excluded for that reason. Their special character means that they are often publicly funded, either in whole or in part.</p>
      <p sl="sv">They are not aimed at groups, primarily on an ability-to-pay basis. Instead, certain services – for example, child care in my own country, Sweden – are aimed at everyone. A number of such services are aimed at people with special needs, for example elderly people with special needs in terms of care or disabled people with their own special needs. The aim is that people should be treated as equally as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">How they are organised differs from country to country in Europe. Often, they are organised locally. They are managed democratically, often in proximity to the people, and are also often run as part of the public sector by public employees. However, the arrangements may also be cooperative and sometimes involve private companies as well. The organisations themselves take decisions locally on how they want the activity to be run.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Social services are important for Europe. They are important for quite a few reasons and, of course, are mainly important to all those who use public services. They contribute to equality, including gender equality. As Mr Rapkay said, social services are important for the economy – without social services in the various parts of Europe, the rest of the economy would not function – and they are especially important for employment, since large numbers of people, especially women, are employed within social services.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When it comes to the importance of these issues for Europe, we can debate what we need to do at European level. I share Mr Rapkay’s view and the view of the majority in my group that we need some form of sector-specific directive, precisely in order to be able to highlight the distinctive character of these services and to distinguish them from commercial services. We need such a directive not for the purpose of withdrawing social services from the local level or of bringing about a situation that is in conflict with the principle of subsidiarity, but with a view to protecting such services on the basis of the activities that they at present engage in and that reflect the diversity of our Member States.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I am growing a little weary, and am getting the impression that we have gone over the same ground a thousand times and that each time, the same arguments are dredged up. We have been doing this for years now. We are of one mind where the importance of social services of general interest are concerned. That much is beyond dispute. I do not, however, share the automatic conclusion that is drawn that, because something has the label ‘social’, market rules should not apply.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are all in favour of subsidiarity, but what does it actually mean? Does it mean that countries or local governments – and this is how I see it – can decide for themselves how they organise their services, or does it mean – as some people believe – that market rules, the rules for fair competition, should not apply?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am not in favour of legislation where it is not needed. We have to carefully identify the problem areas and tailor our solutions to them, with legislation if necessary. There is no need for a general call, which I have been hearing for years in this House, for a legislative framework and sector directive. We should first of all create legal clarity, and I would in that respect refer to the contribution made by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I unconditionally endorse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, many people believe that if something has the label ‘social’ on it, this always involves small-scale services that are not self-sufficient. It goes without saying that we should support services of this kind, and, in fact, the Treaty also provides for this. Council housing, for example, is a multi-million business. It may be situated in the social sector, with a collective objective, but it does involve stacks of money and have the same interests at stake, such as those of corporations, trade unions, employers, politicians and the like.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The only aspect that is lacking right now is the interest of the citizen as a consumer and as a buyer of services, which should, in my view, come first. Competition has, in many cases, led to a better provision of services and better rates, and where necessary, the government can always help out or protect. This is how it is enshrined in the Treaty and I cannot see why a general adjustment should be made at this point in time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to pick up on a point that has been raised by one or two colleagues – that many of the users of social services are not, as it were, everyday consumers. They are people in particular social need and therefore, that is why we look at social services as having a different mission, and possibly a different organisation, to general consumption. It is one of the reasons why we took these services out of the Services Directive, because we did not consider that they operated to the same market rules as travel agencies, construction companies or anything else in the general services sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that we talk about subsidiarity in connection with these services, and many of us were very happy that they stayed with the Member States who have the right to decide how they will organise them and what they will deliver. But those services are under pressure from at least two directions. Firstly, they are under pressure internationally through GATS, and that is why we have retabled an amendment which came from the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Secondly, they are under pressure from market pressures within the European Union, which gradually begin to erode and undermine the rights of Member States to decide exactly how they will organise and finance their services.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why many of us in this House think that not only do we need legal clarity, but we also need to look towards legal protection, because at the moment, all that Member States can operate with is the Treaty. At times, because they have chosen to operate their services in a particular way, they find unintended consequences through market pressures.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards this report, my group feels that the original built a very beautiful frame for social services, but we feel that at the moment all it contains is a sketch rather than certainty and a clear picture, or a clear view, from this Parliament. We have basically said that we want to continue consultation for a further three months and then Parliament will have to decide what it wants to do: whether it wants to maintain decisions that we have taken in earlier reports such as that by Mr Rapkay, or whether we are going to row back and deny a legal protection that many of us believe our social services need.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, there is a problem of interpretation in connection with the activity of services of general interest. Both the European Commission and the Court interpret the systems of compulsory and additional social insurance, which cover fundamental concepts such as health, old age, occupational accidents, unemployment, pensions, disability and services provided directly to persons preventively or for social integration, cohesion and so forth and which include social housing, the integration of people with disabilities or health problems, drug addiction programmes, training programmes for vocational reintegration and other such services, as an economic activity, thereby allowing the Commission to raise the question of opening these services up to undistorted competition.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is a fact that, instead of recognizing the role of such social services of general interest as fundamental and necessary services in a society, the Commission is reversing the terms and trying to open them up to commercialisation by giving third party providers the right to exercise them in return, of course, for a fee. This will result in pressure being exercised on the public-sector aspect and economic aspects of such services.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, it aims to make it harder for public-sector providers of these services by citing the principle of non-discrimination or the articles of the Treaty on European Union. This serves private individuals, given that the alleged lifting of discrimination and the fact that these services are wide open to competition, will allow them to provide social services using corporate methods. If we take account of the fact that social services of general interest and health services are exempted from the Bolkestein directive, then it is easy to see that the Commission is looking for other ways to bring these services within the framework of full liberalisation, thereby enabling multinationals to provide them under a more beneficial regime.</p>
      <p sl="el">This being so, I believe that we must defend the right of the Member States to define social services of general interest as they wish, to maintain their public-sector aspect and not to allow them to be transferred into private hands via a directive as a commodity. These services are vital to society and they cannot be treated as an economic activity in the narrow sense of the term; they must be treated as a social necessity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report, to which I lend my support. Social services of general interest (SSGIs) are today an important instrument that can contribute towards greater social, economic and territorial cohesion and can be seen as a vital component in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These services play a crucial role in addressing certain social deficiencies that the market is not always capable of addressing satisfactorily. SSGIs have certain characteristics – namely, their target public, management, organisation and financing – which set them apart from traditional services. SSGIs have gained great momentum in the way they have dealt with fresh challenges and have altered Europe’s social perspective, meaning that SSGIs nowadays have to adapt to tougher demands. There are cases of SSGIs that can be held up as a good example of flexible management in the labour market. We should look at these very carefully, because there have been some very positive experiences.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that the issue at hand is services that are close to service users, I feel that the regional and local authorities, in conjunction with civil society, could play a role in providing SSGIs. I am convinced, in other words, that it is at local level that these services are at their most effective. Indeed, regardless of adopting best practice and the healthy exchange of experiences between the Member States, I feel that the different cultural standards that exist in the EU must be respected and that the development of SSGIs should be structured and driven forward in accordance with the characteristics of each community. Consequently, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, I share the idea that the diversity of models of organising, managing and financing social services in the Member States should be respected.</p>

    <intervention id="1-080" speaker_id="1938" name="Anne Van Lancker" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur. Let me start by saying, as some fellow Members have already done, that it is because of this House that a wide range of social services have been excluded from the Services Directive, the reason being that for a majority in this House, it is inconceivable that social services should be put on the same footing as commercial ones. Social services guarantee citizens' fundamental rights and they also protect the most vulnerable. They are clearly expressions of solidarity in a society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is why it is good, Commissioner, that the Commission should recognise this specific trait of the social services, although it is obvious to me that this recognition is not, of course, enough in itself. Subsidiarity, too, ceased to be the answer a long time ago, as was very clearly illustrated by Mrs in 't Veld, and by the Commission’s communication in which it explains how the internal market and the competition rules apply, not least to social services. This is not always a favourable situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So, in order to create legal certainty and to determine the extent to which the internal market rules could apply to this broad area, we need a sector-specific directive which, as someone said before me, protects subsidiarity and safeguards the communal task of these social services. This was already mentioned in Mr Rapkay's report. Today, in Mr Ferreira’s report, we are asking the Commission once again to table a proposal by June of this year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I happen to know that the Portuguese Presidency is particularly well disposed towards the social dimension of European policy. Protecting and safeguarding social services fit in perfectly with this aspiration. I therefore hope that this parliamentary report will enjoy broad support in this House and that the Commission will be tabling a constructive proposal by the summer.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Last autumn we were discussing the European Commission's White Book on services of general interest. It is a pity that so far the liberalisation of the services market has been very slight, and the definition of the actual services is unclear.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today we encounter Social Services of General Interest, which are defined as services to which the criteria of general interest are applied – universality, transparency, continuity, accessibility, etc. These services help to ensure a high rate of employment, a high level of social service and healthcare, gender equality, and economic, social and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="lt">These are just general assertions though. The rapporteur has pointed out that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality must be applied to Social Services of General Interest. However, in applying the principle of subsidiarity, countries will themselves define what the Social Services of General Interest are (that is which Social Services are of General Interest), and thus we will never have free movement of services, which is currently one of the most important EU strategies for increasing economic competitiveness. The market protectionism still remains, which not only decreases economic competitiveness, but also prevents consumers from being offered timely services of suitable quality.</p>

By trying, through this communication, to make these services again subject to the laws of the market, the Commission is going down the wrong track.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s hesitancy when it comes to demanding a legislative framework for general interest services of this particular kind is damaging to the European Union. We need an affirmation, in the shape of a law, of the fact that social services are part of the general good, and we need it right now. All MEPs who believe that that sort of affirmation is needed now, should refrain from endorsing the Commission’s woolly compromise and instead vote for this House’s resolution on the White Paper on services of general interest – and hence for our motion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to thank our colleague, Mr Hasse Ferreira, for the work that he has done. Dealing with social services of general interest (SSGIs) is not an easy matter, but he has demonstrated his listening skills throughout our meetings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The key point in our colleague’s report is the launch of a consultation of the parties concerned, the aim of which is to better cater for the characteristics of SSGIs in the application of Community law. Social services are characterised, among other things, by the fact that they are personalised, that they implement basic social rights and that they help increase social cohesion, by protecting the most vulnerable. As such, they are an integral part of the European social model because, in their current form, they are specific to Europe and they contribute to the European growth strategy. They represent a dynamic economic sector and they create jobs, while being distinct from the other services of general economic interest. The services are operated on the basis of the solidarity principle and of their proximity to users.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problem today with the great majority of SSGIs is that they fall directly within the scope of the Community Treaties; in other words, they are subject to the rules of the internal market and of competition. The issue of the application of these rules therefore arises in view of the need for the public authorities to continue intervening regarding arrangements for providing services. This objective to regularise public services fulfils legitimate objectives to do with maintaining the quality of services and making them accessible in urban and rural areas, and with protecting the users and vulnerable people who benefit from them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our social model, which we want to promote as an alternative to ultraliberalism, must not fall victim to our own Community rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur. Social services of general interest are a core element in the social Europe. Being part of public services of general interest, they are meant to ensure that someone in need of support or help actually gets it, and, moreover, irrespective of where they live or of what they earn.</p>
      <p sl="de">Social services must not only be generally accessible and affordable, but also of particularly high quality, for – as has already been pointed out – they are personal and serve the common good, and that is why they must not be exposed to unfettered competition. What is needed instead is particular protection for them and for competition to be put within an unambiguous legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I would like to do right now is just to point out – taking the care of the aged as an example – that demographic change is presenting us with ever greater challenges. After all, in our society, everyone ought not only to have the right to, and a claim on, a dignified old age, but also the certainty of enjoying one.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, failing to put social services on a sounder foundation, we make them more and more subject to the rules of competition, we will certainly end up with sand getting into the European works.</p>
      <p sl="de">We may well, in 2006, have enjoyed good economic growth, with more jobs being created, but there was a further increase in poverty, and so it is only good that enterprises, too, should discharge their social responsibilities and join in providing social services, or that the Member States should involve the social partners more in working out how these should be structured.</p>
      <p sl="de">Good social services must be one way whereby poverty in Europe may be fought against. There is no comparison between social services and a car repair shop; they are not the same thing. The fact that social services need to be viable and affordable calls for a European legal framework, a sector-specific directive, and not only official solidarity on the part of the Member States, but also, on the part of the Members of this House, for a great awareness of responsibility rather than platitudinous speeches.</p>

Their action led to the text being developed and to our institutions changing position in terms of their willingness to liberalise all services, irrespective of the missions and needs that they represent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now need to echo these citizens’ opinions and the values that they hold dear and that we share and to which our rapporteur is giving substance. The tasks fulfilled by SSGIs serve human rights, human dignity, the general interest and social cohesion and, hence, are fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Refusing to acknowledge that and perpetuating the confusion between the notions of economic service and market service, as the Commission is doing, means giving up on Europe’s special social quality and on what it represents for millions of Europeans. Specific legislation is required in order to ensure that people’s right to these services is respected and that they are indeed carried out.</p>

În primul rând, solidaritatea socială şi coeziunea socială reprezintă marca de calitate a Uniunii Europene. În al doilea rând, serviciile sociale, sunt prin definiţie, bazate pe un acces nediscriminat, pe durabilitatea serviciului şi pe protejarea celor vulnerabili. În al treilea rând, este o responsabilitate a instituţiilor europene, astăzi, să găsească soluţia cea mai apropiată şi cea mai potrivită pentru a rezolva aceste probleme. Personal, consider că avem nevoie de o directivă-cadru pe care Comisia s-o prezinte instituţiilor Uniunii Europene şi, în primul rând Parlamentului European astfel încât principiile din acest domeniu să fie bine sistematizate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rămâne însă în sarcina fiecărui stat membru să definească, să organizeze şi să finanţeze serviciile sociale de interes general.

Aş vrea să închei spunând câteva cuvinte pe care le-a spus un mare francez, un mare european avant la lettre, şi pe care o să le spun în franceză.

      <p sl="fr">Behind this report, of course, there are children, there are the elderly, there are the sick, there are those excluded from society, there are disabled people and, finally, in the end, if we are not careful, there will be euthanasia, with the Netherlands, Belgium and, soon, France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore in the realm of what we, the people of France, have for over a century – in thousands of books, lessons and university theses – been calling ‘public services’. That is why, on 29 May 2005, the people of France rejected the constitution of private services. Indeed, with the magnificent word ‘public service’, we are saying that, in a society of women and men, there are shared dimensions of what is owned by a nation as a whole, and that it is within these shared dimensions, such as hospitals, schools and health care, that services are provided to the public. This terminology is superior to that of services of general interest, a term that creates ambiguity and problems in terms of the boundaries between the private sector and the general interest, and between the commercial market – with the competition between overriding interests – and public goods, something that St Thomas Aquinas, back in his day, already used to call the common weal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is precisely because of this problem of boundaries that we are drafting legislation: what are these services, where do they come from, what budget should be allocated to them, which powers fall under the Union, on the one hand, and subsidiarity, on the other, what geographical boundaries are there between Mrs Thatcher’s Europe and social Europe, what boundary is there in terms of housing, employment, childcare, hospital care, between the rich, who can go private, and the poor, who cannot?</p>

      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this debate, which has been very thorough and extremely interesting. I should like, if I may, briefly to go over some points that emerged in the debate, which I feel are particularly relevant and important.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is quite clear that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are, according to the majority view in the debate, very much a unique issue. They are not ordinary services, as they guarantee rights and as they are geared towards people who are, or who may be, too weak or vulnerable to look after themselves and their rights. There was also clearly a strong emphasis on the subsidiarity principle, and on the fact that proposals for different solutions were coming in from all sides. It was also clear that there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the legal definition of these services, in particular concerning the principles governing the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, I feel that all of these issues are important and that we must continue to pay attention to them. The Commission intends to take the following steps: to draw up a European strategy on SSGIs, which will be adopted in the autumn of this year. In this communication the further steps that the Commission intends to take will be put forward. The Commission is assessing legal feasibility and the right political opportunity to propose legal instruments in this area. The communication will be issued in conjunction with the two-year report on SSGIs. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the situation of SSGIs in Europe. It describes progress in modernising these services, emphasises the significance of the sector from a socio-economic perspective and describes the development of legal measures at this time.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, I share your view that social services in the public interest are a fixed element in our social model, that they are set to develop very rapidly, that fresh challenges lie ahead and that debate is needed. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, companies, politicians and above all people understand that the problems of world poverty and of environmental degradation remain stubbornly prevalent in today’s world. For ten years, many companies have begun to examine how they can manage their own social and environmental impacts through initiatives for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Business cannot be expected to take responsibility alone for meeting these challenges. However, it is now time for the communications, the conferences and the codes of conduct to begin to make a significant and measurable difference and a move from process to outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this vote, the European Parliament will draw attention to the limitations of voluntary CSR reporting and of social auditing as it exists today. We will say that the drive for ever lower prices can prejudice fair treatment for people at work. We will insist that CSR can only work by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach, internationally-agreed standards and independent monitoring and verification. We will call for actions to tackle corporate abuses in the world’s developing countries and to provide means for redress for its victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s communications seem to me to opt out of this debate, to prescribe an ‘anything goes’ approach to CSR and to risk Europe falling behind, compared with the rest of the world. However, tonight I am not proposing that we reject the Commission’s approach. Indeed, I am asking the European Parliament to contribute constructively by seeking to rewrite some of the agenda and, where the Commission is making commitments, to come forward with detailed recommendations to turn fine words into concrete actions, to give full transparency to the evolving alliance for business, to rebuild confidence in the European multi-stakeholder forum and bring the NGOs back to the table, to make a genuine financial contribution to enabling CSR to grow, to genuinely put into operation support for CSR principles in Commission policies and programmes, including enterprise, employment, corporate governance and, in particular, trade and development programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that Commissioners Verheugen and Špidla will not be able to accept all of Parliament’s recommendations tonight. However, I am heartened and grateful for the private meetings I have held with them as this report has evolved. I now call on them publicly to promise that decisive progress will be made on CSR at EU level within the life of this Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also know that some Members in the debate will seek to oppose the report: I say to them that this report represents a carefully crafted compromise between the political groups. Indeed, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the shadow rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">The one clear piece of new legislation we will support will be for mandatory environmental and social reporting by business, reiterating our previous position and sending a powerful political signal from this Parliament. All of our other proposals are about more effective use and implementation of the existing regulatory framework and support for voluntary action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say to the opponents inside this Parliament and to the one or two associations outside that, in their enthusiasm to block action at EU level, I do not believe that they do justice or genuinely represent the best interests or the best of business when it comes to CSR. Take the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, speaking on behalf of the business leaders’ initiative for human rights, which told us: ‘Minimum standards are essential for a level playing field to be developed in this area’. Take the European Investment and Research Service, who told us: ‘If you can go some way to rekindling the interest of the Commission in a more substantive approach to CSR, that would be most welcome’. Or take the French business confederation MEDEF, speaking of behalf of Business Europe: ‘I want to thank you very much for the quality and the relevance of most of the questions and suggestions put forward by you.’</p>
      <p sl="en">Now is not the time to retreat. It is time to be ambitious and to show vision and take all of these and others together. One of the key ways we can get greater enthusiasm, dynamism and consensus behind EU action on CSR is by championing it in global institutions and better implementing global CSR initiatives here in Europe. There is also the strategic partnership that I propose between the Commission and the global reporting initiative, a new business dialogue between the EU and Japan on corporate social responsibility, and the use of the fifth anniversary this year of the World Summit on Sustainable Development as an opportunity for us in Europe to lead the international debate for intergovernmental initiatives and corporate accountability, which was agreed at Johannesburg.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the Commission published its communication it said it wanted Europe to be a pole of excellence for CSR. When I read it I feared that CSR in Europe was instead falling down a black hole. However, if we can agree substantively on many of the recommendations in this Parliament report, I believe that we can make the Commission’s aspiration come true.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, it is indeed true to say that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is marching ahead in Europe, and last year’s communication from the Commission triggered a great wave of activities and new ideas.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is because CSR can make a great contribution to sustainable development and enhance Europe’s potential for innovation and its competitiveness that it is closely tied in with our strategy for growth and employment, the object of which is not only to create more jobs but also, and primarily, to create better ones. We are talking here not about short-term successes or apparently favourable quarterly results, but rather about the need for our companies to adjust in the long term to the changed conditions under which we have to compete in the world as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Favourable social conditions may well be an important factor in competition, but producing them is not a responsibility for policy-makers alone; businesses have a responsibility of their own, and it goes beyond mere obedience to the law. They are responsible for the social climate, for the environment, for equality of opportunity, for training, for innovation and for structural change; to sum up, they are responsible for the people who work for them, and for the location where they are based.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission welcomes Mr Howitt’s report, which is evidence of deep knowledge and competence and not only essentially endorses the Commission’s aim of strengthening CSR in Europe, but also makes an important contribution towards achieving it. I certainly agree that the debate should aim to achieve concrete results; that the multi-stakeholder approach should embrace all the interested parties and groups affected; and that the whole process should be even better integrated into the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">You will be aware that the Commission believes that the openings for regulation in this area are limited. We do not believe that an enterprise’s culture can be imposed from above or standardised by legislation, and that is why the Commission has been unwilling to take a decision in favour of proposing a regulation on CSR or the standardisation of it at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">If something, somewhere, has to be regulated; if we, by reason of our political responsibility have to insist on businesses doing something, then we have to summon up the courage to enact the relevant legislation, which must be specific and practically relevant to the area in question, but corporate social responsibility is, by definition, something that goes beyond companies’ obligations under the law and is more than that which we lay down in regulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to support businesses and to encourage them to make use of the internationally recognised instruments, which are available in great numbers. The Commission is also supporting CSR in the global context, for example, through the EU-Africa Business Forum, brought into existence by my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel, in which representatives of businesses from both continents met in November 2006 to discuss social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission is continuing to discuss with developing countries the progress being made in implementing the basic standards of the International Labour Organisation, and, in Europe, we are promoting the further development of relevant instruments within the various sectors, alongside multi-sectoral initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">My fellow-Commissioner Mr Špidla and I are meeting more and more business people who are getting committed to and involved in making Europe a front-runner where CSR is concerned, and who see it as putting their businesses at a definite advantage on the market. In the short time in which it has been in existence, the European CSR Alliance has set in motion some impressive and exemplary initiatives, and far-sighted managers and investors have long known that a company with a good record of CSR is usually a successful one, as, indeed, is evident from the prices at which such businesses’ shares are quoted on stock exchanges.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission calls on Europe’s businesses to make CSR a European brand and to compete for the best ideas. We are convinced that a European company must be one that acknowledges its own social responsibility and acts accordingly. That is something on which the Commission and your House are in complete agreement.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Verheugen has characterised the general framework of corporate social responsibility. I feel I must emphasise that this is about voluntary commitments on the part of businesses, commitments that clearly go beyond what the law requires. This must not of course restrict the right of any lawmaker or relevant authority to draw up any law it deems essential.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Given that the general framework has been described sufficiently clearly, I should like to present a number of specific areas in which we support corporate initiatives and which form part of the March 2006 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">First of all, businesses play a major role in professional cohesion and also support social cohesion insofar as they hire workers and are involved in human resources management. Secondly, 2007 has been declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. We have neither the right nor the means to deprive ourselves of our diverse talents, and therefore we support corporate initiatives aimed at equal opportunities. Thirdly, an important part of the intergenerational pact, which ageing Europe desperately needs, is cohesion and the retention of older people in employment. The other priorities in the March communication, such as health, investment in lifelong learning, innovation in training, science and operating on a global scale are equally important. The text you will be debating addresses these very issues.</p>
      <p sl="cs">If we want to ensure that corporate social responsibility continues into the 21st century there needs to be dialogue with the whole community, and for this reason in December we held a multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility. At the same time, it was decided to convene a European level discussion body from one of the plenary sittings, which will bring together representatives from civil society, the world of business and academic institutions. These forums have made it possible for us to assess the results of initiatives launched since 2004. As regards Commission initiatives I believe that corporate social responsibility is becoming increasingly influential across all of our policies, and in particular in external EU policy. Issues of common interest for the future have also been staked out, such as education, research and working conditions across chains of subcontractors. This will clearly have a major impact in fostering more secure social conditions in regions outside Europe for subcontractors who work for European firms.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is much work to be done but we are on the right track. It can be seen from our debates and discussions with interested parties that corporate social responsibility is an increasingly important issue. It is important to maintain existing conditions and to be unstinting in our efforts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report. I think he has managed to present a report that can secure widespread support in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important to make some remarks about corporate social responsibilities. First of all, the main task of companies is to deliver the services and products they are established for and to be run at a profit, because otherwise they will not survive. If they cannot fulfil these main tasks, they will fail in their fundamental social responsibility as employers and as producers of services and goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important to underline this when we discuss how to define corporate social responsibilities. Our point of view – because we have discussed this question in the ITRE committee as well as within our group – is that it should be a matter of voluntary responsibility. It has to be performed on its own merits and as a part of the responsibility that the individual company has in society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Companies have a social role in society. They must be good employers, delivering services and products of a high quality, because otherwise they will lose credibility and they will lose out in the market. But there are also grounds for saying that they must behave well in their own terms, because good and strong companies who stand up for fundamental values, whether in Europe or anywhere else in the world, are contributing to a better world, but also to a better economy and to better products and services.</p>
      <p sl="en">There should be voluntary responsibility, because otherwise legislation would be needed and that is another matter. If we try to streamline too much, we will lose the variety and the dynamism that each company can deliver by making the most of its opportunities to be a good employer, a good company and a good service and product provider.</p>

      <p sl="el">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. – Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in its opinion on corporate social responsibility, calls on the rapporteur for a holistic understanding of this issue, because it believes that the role of companies is fundamental as regards respect for the values underpinning the European Union, irrespective of where they trade, within or outside the European Union, and irrespective of their size, of whether they are small or medium-sized enterprises, multinationals and so on.</p>
      <p sl="el">At global level, core standards of the International Labour Organisation are promoted through corporate social responsibility. Within a framework of voluntary action, they can introduce measures to support female human resources, within the framework of national and Community legislation on gender equality and non-discrimination, both during the recruitment procedure and during the procedure to promote and elect women to the administration bodies, to the board of directors, when promoting the planning of actions for corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="el">We congratulate the European Commission on reinforcing the new alliance and we do not believe that it will be a repetition of the multi-stakeholder forum. A charter of good practice to which companies subscribe voluntarily will help to promote actions for the living and working environment and facilitate a better combination of professional and home life alongside cultural and educational services.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, we are calling for good corporate social responsibility practices to be promoted and rewarded, especially in the gender equality sector, but not with a mandatory report by companies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioners, allow me to express the view that the possibilities of voluntary application of corporate social responsibility, not as a means of advertising or competition, should be planned in the multi-stakeholder forum, which is a forum for discussion between all the social partners, and we hope that there will be significant female participation in it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, far and away most of the EU’s businesses have committed themselves to social responsibility, to socially and environmentally responsible action, to the protection of people and their environment, and to security of production. They support cultural and religious facilities, sports and clubs. As both Commissioners have just said, though, it is and remains a prerequisite that these things should be done on a voluntary basis, something laid down in the European Parliament report back in 2003, and, a year later, on the occasion of the founding of the Multi-Stakeholder Forum. If you want to maintain the voluntary character of this commitment, you have to reject binding regulations and suffocating bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">A comprehensive reporting system ought, if at all, to be expected only of large companies; SMEs, which make up over 90% of all companies, cannot cope with it, for they quite simply lack the human and financial resources required to give an all-round picture of their CSR. My group’s shadow rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, has succeeded in reaching some compromises that have the effect of defusing the Howitt report, which my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was right to reject.</p>
      <p sl="de">I count it a victory that the demand for the award of public contracts to be made dependent on compliance with social and environmental clauses has been largely struck out. Firms must be able to win a public contract even if they do not have an ecologically-correct pot of flowers in front of the factory gate and even if the menu of their works canteen does not include alternative meals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Paragraph 11, which calls for the setting-up of a central point of coordination for CSR, is problematic, as are paragraphs 39 and 55, which advocate the appointment of an ombudsman for CSR. I am opposed to any extension of enterprises’ liability and obligations to account for their corporate social responsibility, and regard such dirigiste manipulations as unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we are talking today about an own-initiative report, one that many do not take seriously on the grounds that it is thought to be no more than a declamation. What I say is: principiis obsta – resist that which is only just beginning! If this House calls for some of all this to be made mandatory, then legislative measures from the Commission are no longer far away.</p>

      <p sl="hu">A transnational company has, within its network in one of the new Member States, employed people living with handicaps as cleaners in a city struggling with social problems. The company received subsidies from the local authorities for these employees with handicaps, thereby depleting almost the entire funding source available for this purpose. In my view this mode of behaviour does not meet our expectations regarding corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The efforts to recover costs can and must in all cases be harmonised with social goals. This is pointed out in Richard Howitt’s excellent report. I would add that a favourable economic environment has since the early 1990s attracted numerous transnational companies to Central and Eastern Europe. Certain regions of the new EU Member States continue, however, to experience multiple disadvantages. To use a distinctive phrase: they are in a sense the European Union’s internal peripheries. Therefore we must make it clear to transnational companies as well that their actions must follow the principle of ‘think globally – act locally’. This will help avoid that certain regions of the Union become peripheries that only ‘think globally’.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is why I consider Richard Howitt’s report to be important, and this is why I hope that it does not sink under arguments over formalities, but will develop its role within the European social model of CSR. Corporate social responsibility does not simply mean avoiding doing harm, but is an ordered system for positive actions. The question here is not whether or not certain actions can be prescribed, but rather whether they can fulfil expectations in view of a better world. It is my belief that they can. We can expect that they treat employees as human beings, in their entirety, with their rights, state of health and cultural and social traditions. Richard Howitt’s report is a very important step along this path.</p>

      <p sl="et">I am certain that corporate social responsibility promotes sustainable development and also the improved implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in such matters as the more sensible use of natural resources, improving the results of innovation activity, the reduction of poverty, and also, of course, improved compliance with human rights requirements.</p>
      <p sl="et">Corporate social responsibility should also act as an additional measure for the management of industry and restructuring, and act so that new areas are added to it; for instance, lifelong learning, equal opportunities, social involvement, sustainable development, and also ethics.</p>
      <p sl="et">Companies’ participation in such social activities must be voluntary. If we wish to move forward towards the creation and development of traditions in the area of corporate social responsibility, it is inevitable that we follow agreed and internationally recognised principles.</p>
      <p sl="et">We have no other framework or agreed system with which we could adequately measure companies’ activities in connection with corporate social responsibility. Thus the creation of the institution of ombudsman would be premature and pointless at the present moment.

      <p sl="en">Yesterday I participated in a citizens’ consultation, and it is quite obvious what citizens want – they want Europe to be more active on environmental issues. I think that last Friday’s Council was well received by citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second thing that citizens want is greater social responsibility, and I am afraid the Barroso-Verheugen Commission went in entirely the opposite direction when it took office. So, Commissioner, you have already turned somewhat on environmental and energy issues under pressure from science and from citizens. I hope that this report by Parliament, especially if it is not watered down too much tomorrow, will help you to reconsider your social agenda. It was the Commission not being active enough in the multi-stakeholder dialogue that played a large part in frustrating NGOs to the extent that they left the table completely.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some good bits in the report which will be voted on tomorrow. I just wanted to highlight one issue: the deletion of paragraph 63, in which we call for global leadership from the European Union on this issue. Why is this important? With more Chinese oil and mining companies investing in Africa and other areas, if Europe does not elevate corporate social responsibility from a purely European issue to a global, UN issue, our companies will lose out, so I do not understand how the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups can delete a paragraph from the original report as voted on that calls for us to be much more proactive on a global level.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate and thank Mr Howitt for his initiative and his report, and to endorse the series of amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As has been demonstrated, the main problem or the main question in our debate is over whether regulation is in fact needed in this area or whether a voluntary approach will suffice. I for one am not in favour of excessive bureaucracy and superfluous regulation. In questions such as corporate social responsibility, however, it is clear that relying on the goodwill of businesses is simply not enough. Otherwise, a part of the population of Europe will find itself facing an unequal situation. I feel, though, that what is needed is a workable legal instrument that would force companies to fulfil their responsibilities not only in the social field but also in the area of protecting working conditions, health at work and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Although I warmly endorse this report, I have tabled two amendments in conjunction with members of our group, the purpose of which is firstly to sound a warning about the current situation and the problems faced by workers regarding, for example, company relocations, low salaries, precarious work and insufficient health protection at work, and secondly to express our objection to the policies proposed by the Commission in the area of social responsibility, which often do not match the goals and the principles on which corporate social responsibility should be based.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I hope we will succeed in producing not only a statement of intent, but also the practical instruments needed to take practical action. If not, we will end up with mere window-dressing, and I believe that the citizens expect more from us than that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in this House we talk constantly about the Lisbon Agenda, which is supposed to make the EU the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010. The Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, likes to boast about his plans to control excessive regulation to help enhance the competitiveness of European economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet this report, as originally presented, sought to create mandatory regulation of a wide range of areas of corporate activity, including employee relations and the environment. But these areas are already heavily regulated, indeed massively over-regulated, by EU legislation already on the statute book. What we were proposing to do here was to double up on existing regulation with all the potential for ambiguity and confusion that would have created.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mandatory CSR would be hugely damaging to competitiveness, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, to which we constantly pay lip-service but which we constantly seek to strangle with oppressive, intrusive and unnecessary regulation. However, there are now agreed amendments which firmly establish the voluntary nature of CSR and I for one strongly support those amendments. I agree with the rapporteur that we need to promote CSR, but we also need to protect the enterprise, productivity, competitiveness and wealth-creating capacity of European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also be aware of existing best practice of CSR amongst existing major businesses. Last summer, I had the privilege of visiting the Gates Foundation in Seattle, which of course is run by Bill Gates of Microsoft. This Foundation’s spending on philanthropy exceeds the GDP of a number of small countries. Arguably, it does more to relieve poverty and hardship in Africa than EU aid does and, because it is a private sector organisation, its spending is hugely more efficient. I believe that, with the amendments that we are proposing to put in place here, we should be able to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the main function of business is wealth creation, but companies are, in certain circumstances, capable of being more than merely wealth-generating machines. Companies can also be seen as communities in which people live and interact; people can view their company as their place of professional fulfilment, and even, in many cases, personal happiness.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Successful companies, those capable of creating wealth, are those that normally enjoy good relations with their partners, customers, suppliers and with the community in which they operate. Successful companies are those that adopt transparency criteria in their relations with the authorities and operate on the basis of codes of conduct and ethics, which are sometimes extremely stringent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If one were to describe companies that exist for a long time in human terms, there are companies that function with a strong personality, with a particular culture that they have managed to create and develop and that identifies them and distinguishes them from the others. These are companies, one might say, with emotions and feelings. Companies such as these opt to give more to the community over and above their traditional functions and thereby take on a greater responsibility; this is what might be termed ‘social responsibility’. I feel, however, that corporate social responsibility is not something that can be decreed or imposed, but something that must be entered into willingly. Corporate social responsibility can never be imposed from above. If it were, there would be a risk of reducing its role to a public relations exercise aimed at creating a smokescreen and at enabling companies to sidestep their responsibilities of addressing social and environmental issues. In which case corporate social responsibility would be a fraud because it would be insincere.</p>

He is also showing great capacity and flexibility on such a complex issue, opening himself up to dialogue and agreement with other groups in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">As others have said, I believe that corporate social responsibility is good per se. This must not lead us to think, however, that it is not possible to improve our current framework and the relatively short experience we have acquired in the European Union. I believe that the world’s problems are increasing at a considerable speed, both environmental problems and the problems faced by people who are deprived of all kinds of rights. I therefore believe that we must make an additional effort.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is all Mr Howitt is asking us for in his report. I hope that the Commission, whose Communication has had a mixed reception, not very positive in some cases, will see this as an opportunity to take more account of social responsibility. Much can still be done, avoiding false debates on what should be voluntary and what should not. We must continue moving forward with a view to creating criteria to make responsibility objective. Companies will be free to adopt codes of conduct, but they cannot be free when it comes to respecting the codes of conduct that they have adopted. There must be transparency, there must be more than philanthropy in this notion of corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="es">We Europeans offer the world a model based on the sustainability of our economic model for us and for others. We can go further on the control and verification of these obligations that have been taken on freely. We have directives in the European Union. Directives that have not been transposed in the Member States on union law, on environmental responsibilities.

      <p sl="fr">With this in mind, I have a proposal for you, Commissioners. A system is already applied internationally by hundreds of thousands of businesses. This system coordinates the social responsibility of businesses via the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 standards, which ensure that business relationships with customers are better, that practices are totally environmentally-friendly and that hygiene, health and safety rules are complied with in full.

      <p sl="en">One of the key points to come out of the report is that we are not just looking at corporate social responsibility within the European Union, but beyond the Union as well, and at the behaviour of European companies elsewhere in the world – a move away from the double standards of how you operate here with one legislative framework and what you think you can get away with somewhere else.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have heard from the Commission on the Africa Forum is a good initiative, but we need to look much more closely at how companies behave in conflict zones. We have the leadership on the diamond process at the moment and we need to move forward on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also note from the report that voluntary reporting is now stabilising and that not all voluntary reports cover supply chain compliance, which is one of the most important mechanisms we have to drive up standards, to ensure brand protection for companies behaving well and to ensure that they avoid the actions of companies which behave irresponsibly. I look forward to Parliament’s report on socially irresponsible corporate behaviour so that we can look at the contrast in how we work.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am aware that the concept of corporate social responsibility is becoming an increasingly important part of the debate on globalisation, competitiveness and sustainable development. According to the definition of this concept, companies voluntarily take account of the social and economic impact of the activities they undertake.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the framework of implementation of social responsibility on a voluntary basis, companies decide to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and commitments resulting from collective agreements, in order to respond to social and environmental needs. I should like to make it very clear, from the floor of this House, that it is precisely the voluntary basis of the action taken and of companies’ response to the notion of social responsibility that is vital.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As corporate social responsibility is based mainly on decisions taken by companies on a voluntary basis, I believe that the imposition of any kind of additional duties and administrative requirements would most probably prove counterproductive. It would also be at variance with the principles of better legal regulation and with efforts to simplify and improve the functioning of the European Union. It was with this in mind that I tabled 10 amendments to the text presented by Mr Howitt, and I am pleased that the spirit of these amendments has been incorporated into the compromise text proposed by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to underline the importance of introducing methods for the exchange of good practice concerning implementation of the notion of corporate social responsibility. In practice this can be achieved in the framework of the European Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility. From the floor of the House I would like to commend the European Commission on its commitment. The Commission recognises that the companies themselves are the main players on this stage, and has announced its support for this body, which represents a sound and open way of exchanging good practice between all types of companies be they large, small or medium-sized.</p>

On the one hand, the dramatic change in the climate, due in large part to the uncontrolled use and consumption of natural resources and, on the other hand, the worrying spread of poverty, in conjunction with the reversal of the demographic pyramid, appear to be the result of attempts to downgrade employment and overturn the social acquis. Nonetheless, if we want to flesh out the bones of this concept, at least three preconditions need to be met: firstly, the Commission needs to take serious account of the proposals tabled by Parliament. Secondly, it should be acknowledged that companies need to accept their responsibilities towards the environment, society and the workers which derive from their economic activity, without of course this being seen as a sacrifice on their part. Thirdly, priority should be given to supporting investments designed to promote workers' knowledge and the development of new technologies, especially those which are more environmentally friendly. Both these sectors should be seen as basic pillars of corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, this is an excellent opportunity to prove that the competitiveness must not be at the workers' expense, but must go hand in glove with respect for environmental equilibria, the promotion of dignified working conditions and social progress in general.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, over the past seven years I have had the pleasure of debating CSR with Richard Howitt on and off for a considerable time. It has, of course, been a most enjoyable experience – as it says here! It has certainly been a challenge, but I am sure he would be the first to admit – and I see him chortling over there – that it has been a challenge for both of us. I would like to thank him for the way that he has risen to that challenge, because clearly we have both been approaching this issue from slightly different standpoints, although in our ways, like all the other speakers, we are equally wishing to champion the cause of CSR.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should just like to take issue on two tiny points with which he opened his comments. Firstly, he said he was disappointed that the Commission report almost indicated that it was opting out. I disagree with that. I think its report was very positive and we should welcome it. Secondly, he said that he hoped that the Commission would help bring the NGOs back to the multi-stakeholder forum table. In fairness, it was neither the Commission nor the multi-stakeholders that encouraged them to leave. They themselves chose to leave. It is up to them whether they wish to come back or not. Some of them at least had a minority view – in a democracy that is perfectly permitted. However – if the interpreters can rise to this challenge – we should not allow the tail to wag the dog. It is up to the NGOs to return.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not comment further on his speech, nor, indeed, make other comments in detail about colleagues’ speeches other than to say I am sure the President and Commissioners are aware that – with no disrespect to any of my colleagues including myself – sometimes our speeches are for different audiences because we have to impress constituents back home. There is nothing wrong with that; we are politicians and that is something we have to do. However, I would invite you particularly, rather than just listen to us talk, to read what we say, to read what we are voting upon because the text is very significant.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some aspects I still dislike about the text. I agree with Mrs Oviir from the ALDE Group in that I do not like the idea of an ombudsman, but it is an idea. There are a number of ideas that I do not particularly welcome, but they are ideas and all these ideas are generally worth serious consideration. However, the text is what is important. I particularly invite the Commission to think of the three reports: the original report that went to committee; the report that was amended and voted against by 15 members of the committee; and the final report as it is likely to emerge tomorrow. That report I believe will be very much on your side. If I may say so, Commissioners, I think you are a great double act. Tomorrow we will show we are a treble act and wish to follow your lead in advancing the cause of CSR.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, what seems clear first of all is that more and more companies see social and environmental responsibility as an opportunity, as an instrument for sustainable development, for growth and for creating jobs, and also as a good instrument for helping companies and workers to adapt better to the changes demanded by the globalised economy of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to comment on two issues in particular. Firstly, that it is clear that companies are the main players and that we must also take account of other parties such as consumers and non-governmental organisations. Above all, however, I believe that we must take account of the central role of unions, and codes of conduct cannot replace the crucial role of unions and collective negotiation under any circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, it is clear that corporate social responsibility must be a factor that increases competitiveness, but behind the labels relating to corporate social responsibility there must be realities and not just mere propaganda. Otherwise, we will undermine them and consumers will not trust those labels and we will stop moving towards corporate social responsibility and its capacity to create more competitive companies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many companies are currently making decisive efforts towards corporate social responsibility and they naturally know that it offers added value, and I am sure that those who do it in a clear and fair way will not object to it being verified by means of objective data.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to welcome the report by my fellow Member Mr Howitt. The debate concerning corporate social responsibility is a very sensitive subject on which people are divided, since we would like to ensure a strong European social environment, while at the same time wishing to enhance the competitiveness of European companies. The current practice of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is an excellent example of the fact that strengthening the social and environmental dimension does not necessarily mean a decline in companies’ competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We need to strengthen the European social model, but we must avoid introducing a mandatory model based on a single pattern. A better regulated voluntary model offers greater opportunities both to producers and to consumers, rather than new administrative burdens that are difficult to bear. If we reinforce voluntary CSR by defining minimum standards with which we can avoid excessive increase in expenditure on the part of smaller companies, then this will be able to increase their competitiveness, provided consumers are sufficiently informed about CSR-type production and business practices. We need to increase consumer awareness and information, as this creates a market for responsible production.</p>

    <intervention id="1-114" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is grateful for the constructive and frank spirit of this debate. I would like to stress once more that Mr Howitt’s report contains numerous valuable suggestions that the Commission will be happy to take into account in the further development of its policies on CSR. This will bring us, together, a good way further ahead.</p>
      <p sl="de">Businesses need a clear legal framework; they have to know what they have to do and what they must not do. If they do not, they cannot function on the market. Businesses have a social responsibility; that is why there are thousands of rules, at the European level and in the Member States, compelling companies to discharge their responsibility to society. All the legislation we have enacted – be it on the protection of consumers, health and safety at work, protection of the environment or social security benefits – is intended to compel social responsibility on the part of business and set standards that we believe absolutely have to be met. The intellectual problem we have with the debate we are having is that I, for one, find it difficult to imagine how we are supposed to fashion a legal framework for something that is not prescribed by law. The idea of creating a regulatory framework for CSR means that one would be enacting a law regulating how companies have to handle things that the law does not require them to handle. That is inherently contradictory, and the Commission really did want to put this debate behind it, and, for once, to see real progress being made; that is why, last year, we encouraged European businesses to get this Alliance for CSR up and running. As I told you, and as you can also read in the Commission’s report that you have before you, this has already come up with some pretty remarkable ideas and initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two very important things – to which Mr Turmes referred – that I would like to discuss. The first is the Multi-Stakeholder Forum, in the holding of which the Commission was heavily involved, and which made some important proposals that the Commission is taking on board. There was very broad support for the Commission’s stance. Some non-governmental organisations did not come on the grounds that their line differed from that taken by the Commission, and I find that a peculiar way of behaving in a democratic society – taking part in a discussion only if you are sure that everyone else is going to agree with you. I therefore expressed regret at the non-attendance of these non-governmental organisations, which were few in number, but we want to continue to engage in dialogue with them, and I have specifically asked them to rejoin us in this work in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">As for the global dimension, which Mr Turmes also had something to say about, the Commission is wholeheartedly supportive. Before the end of this year, we will be staging a major conference on the subject of the international dimension of CSR, a topic that we have already broached in our dialogue with the other regions of the world, most notably with the developing economies such as China, India, Latin America and Africa, but which we are also discussing with the USA, the Japanese and other European partners, and it is a subject that we want to move forward at the global level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Reference has been made in this debate to the existence of an ISO standard for corporate social responsibility. Such a thing does, indeed, exist, but it is a voluntary standard; for companies can decide for themselves whether or not they want to use it, and the good thing is that more and more European companies do, and also make use of it for marketing purposes, telling their customers – society at large – that ‘we, X Ltd, act in accordance with this standard’ and they also want to be judged on that basis, for they see it as useful in terms of their market success.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like – and I am also speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Špidla when I say this – to offer your House our continued close and constructive cooperation on this matter, and will reiterate that we have, in Mr Howitt’s report and in the debate, found many important suggestions, which the Commission will take into consideration as it continues to work on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Business, or entrepreneurship, is the deciding factor for the development of people and society. Business has to consider products, organisation, marketing, design and production processes. The key factor in business, however, is its human capital, which must always be promoted and protected, and human capital is the result of education: education about safety, trust, creativity, the ability to learn, and a taste for what is useful and beautiful.</p>
      <p sl="it">To become competitive in the marketplace, companies need to be able to make the most of these aspects and also to exercise strong social responsibility in caring not only about their product but above all about their work and their workers. If entrepreneurs exercise this responsibility of their own free will, it creates a virtuous circle among company, capital and work, helping them to compete effectively in the global marketplace.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased that we can get down to the final debate on the gender equality roadmap this evening. In this respect, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has spent the last few months examining a very important document sent to us by the Commission. It is significant that the roadmap work has also been pushed through by Commissioner Špidla, not least because this is one of those subjects that are never finished once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="it">In examining it once again and analysing all the topics that were put to us, we were able to focus on a number of basic issues in particular. We started from the principle that underlies all our actions, which is that promoting the rights of the individual must be mainstreamed in all our policies and therefore, as a natural consequence of that, there must be zero tolerance across Europe.</p>
      <a text="(The President cut off the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="it">In this roadmap, we started by establishing the fact above all that promoting the rights of the individual underlies …</p>
      <a text="(The speaker was cut off again)"/>
      <p sl="it">I shall start again. Our starting-point was the promotion of the rights of the individual and, as a natural consequence, we arrived at the conclusion that in focusing on the promotion of rights we must also aim at zero tolerance of any failure to respect such rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately we all know that violence is still a major, significant issue in Europe: available data in fact show that one woman in three suffers violence at some time in her life. We also know that women make up 52% of Europe’s population, and that makes you realise that there is an enormous percentage of people in our Europe even today that suffer violence during their lifetime. We are asking the Union to pay particular attention to this point.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other point that we took into consideration was the subject of poverty. In this case as well, a great many reports, including previous ones, have shown how the risk of poverty affects women most of all, in view of the fact that 85% of single-parent families are headed by women and, on average, this is considered the situation in which it is easiest to drop down to the poverty line. In that respect as well, we think that one of the main actions that we can carry out at an EU level is to enhance all those policies that can provide women with economic independence, in other words those policies that facilitate access to the job market.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is still a considerable gender gap in employment levels, although admittedly the situation varies from one country to another. When women have jobs, it has been shown that on average they are paid 15% less than men for the same work. In this context as well, therefore, we are calling for policies and monitoring to prevent this from happening any more.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third, and no less consequential issue that was taken into consideration was the need to reconcile family life and work. A number of policies were identified that could make an enormous contribution to reconciling family life and work, not only at European level but also applicable to the Member States. They touch on the subject of the costs of maternity and paternity, which should be borne by society as a whole in this Europe where fewer and fewer babies are being born, and address the age-old but as yet unsolved problem of the need for better, more accessible, more flexible services that are aimed not just at childcare but also at care for the disabled, the seriously ill and the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="it">To achieve that, we believe it is essential to mainstream gender policy in the EU budget and in Community programmes, such as the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme and so forth. External policies also need to be taken forward: we believe that all the accession policies as well as the neighbourhood, foreign and development policies need to take account of respect for women’s rights. Lastly, but not because they are any less important, we must address all the immigration-related issues, from enslavement to polygamy and genital mutilation: on these the Union must take a strict stand. As I said at the beginning, we must aim at zero tolerance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to thank Parliament and in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the rapporteur Mrs Sartori, along with the other parliamentary committees that contributed to the report on the roadmap for equality between men and women. The plurality and range of opinions reflects the aims of the roadmap, which cuts across all EU policy, both internal and external. It also illustrates the fact that issues of gender equality affect us all and that it is far from being an issue solely for women.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Parliament’s report is a manifestation of our shared undertaking to work towards greater equality between women and men, thanks to the instruments that the Treaty has given us. With this roadmap we are again confirming the need to develop a strategic, long-term approach to issues of equality. Moreover, we wish to confirm the need for an approach that in itself addresses special measures and support for gender mainstreaming. The Commission notes that the opinions of the different institutions on various issues are coming closer together and welcomes the fact that your report points this out. I should like to highlight some of these.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Equality between women and men is primarily an issue of rights and the position of women in society. Equality is first and foremost an obligation and an inalienable right. Regulations are a vital prerequisite if we want to establish the foundations for and conditions of genuine equality. In this developing environment, the Community has a legal framework that is among the most advanced in the world. What is still needed, however, is for these measures to bring about a real change in the situation of women.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The existence of regulations and laws does not automatically mean that those laws are implemented for the benefit of our citizens. Our efforts must be stepped up to ensure that these rights are put into practice in daily life. The roadmap and Parliament’s report show that the Commission and Parliament will continue to be allies in this regard, and this is something I welcome. The legal framework must also reflect current tasks and needs, and address them and adjust itself to them. The Commission has therefore undertaken to examine some of the amendments that have not been recast with a view to bringing them up to date, where necessary. We have taken an important first step concerning the directive on maternity and family holidays, and in October of last year we launched the first stage of the formal consultation with the social partners. We are currently also assessing the implementation of Directive 86613 on self-employed women and women who support this kind of activity, as well as Directive 797 on equal treatment for men and women in the area of social security, in order to ascertain whether it is necessary to propose any amendments.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Along with issues of rights, there is also of course the economic issue, because lifelong economic independence for women is of vital importance. The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment established the framework and targets for improving the situation of women in the labour market. Even though we have recently seen very significant increases in the proportion of women in the labour market, women have always suffered discrimination and disadvantages simply because they are women. For example, women are paid 15% less on average for the same work, even with the appropriate regulations in place. The Commission has already begun to address the issue of equal pay for equal work and intends to continue doing so. In the months ahead we will work on a communication on pay inequality, the purpose of which is to start removing the causes behind this inequality, which has continued despite years of legislation, and to propose changes and courses of action. Economic independence can be achieved only if we develop genuine policies for reconciling work life with private and family life, and this is true not only for women but for men too. We are aware that one of the main obstacles blocking women from starting or continuing a career is the difficulty of reconciling family and work life, especially as women have always carried out most of the family and household duties. The Commission has therefore consulted the social partners in order to ascertain whether the regulations on these issues need to be updated. The suggestions made by the social partners will be important in deciding on further developments. We strongly believe that this is a field in which substantial progress can be made.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Furthermore, we have quantified objectives in respect of child care services, and these are Barcelona objectives. The year 2010 is approaching and so we must step up our efforts, including for example, taking the opportunity offered by the structural funds to support the Member States in developing childcare structures, which will now fall under the framework of activities eligible for European Social Fund financing. As regards the decision-making process, it is clear that women are still absent from management boards and from positions of high responsibility in politics and economics. I firmly believe in the importance of role models and I am well aware of the significance of informal networks in careers. One of our priorities will be to set up a network for women in the field of economic and political decision-making, and to gather and disseminate information on the role of women via our database.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report refers to another, very important issue; that of gender budgeting. We have to be capable of gauging the resources allocated to our priorities and of ensuring that essential financial resources are allocated to support these priorities. Gender budgeting is an excellent instrument, which will enable us to make use of this information. In terms of improving the methodology, we must therefore improve the collection and the accessibility of this information, as well as the exchange of best practice. We are aware of this and we therefore recommend a pragmatic approach in this area. We have launched a study on introducing the perspective of gender equality into the budgetary process.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to reassure you, with regard to the Commission’s commitment to supporting the fulfilment of political targets in the area of gender equality, that appropriate financial resources will be made available. Many programmes or support mechanisms are already linked to measures in this area. I could mention, of course, the European social fund, the aim of which is above all to support measures aimed at gender equality, as well as other programmes on a smaller scale aimed at supporting the development of public policies on equality, such as the newly integrated PROGRESS programme. I am sure that the European institute for women and men will in the years ahead play a major role in raising awareness on such issues, by gathering and disseminating information on the situation of women. At this level there needs to be complementarity of all of these financial resources in support of the one aim.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I share your opinion that the increasing diversity of our society, including ethnic diversity, presents us with new challenges. We must look more closely at the different forms of discrimination suffered by women migrants. The European year of equal opportunities gives us a platform for exchanging opinions on this issue, because one of the problems it is designed to address is multiple discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Combating violence against women and trafficking in women is also among the Union’s priorities. We have drawn up a range of measures mainly as part of the DAPHNE programme on the fight against all forms of violence against women in Europe, including sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation and trafficking in women. It is also very important to include support for equality in development policies and external policy, as the EU is the biggest donor in the world. The values governing our action in the Union must be the values that we uphold when it comes to third countries. We must use our finances better, for example by strengthening the capabilities and effectiveness of bodies fighting for women’s rights around the world.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As you are aware, this issue is the central theme of the communication on gender equality and development policies that the Commission adopted on 8 March – International Women’s Day. The roadmap for gender equality establishes control mechanisms similar to the annual work programme, with an assessment of the situation halfway through the period and a final assessment at the end. I believe that these mechanisms are very important, as they constitute an important instrument for good reporting. With these instruments. European citizens can monitor whether we are honouring our commitments in the area of equality between women and men.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, as you are well aware, we in the Committee on Development have always paid great attention to the situation of women in these countries. The roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010 places the emphasis back on the discrimination problems that we have been condemning: the fight against violence, against discrimination in the workplace and wage discrimination, the lack of public space in which women can make their voices heard etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">We congratulate the Commission on dealing with all of these issues in the new roadmap, although we must insist that it be effectively implemented and to that end make an assessment of previous plans and set up a public discussion on their results, which have not always been as positive as we could have expected.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, this time the external dimension has been considered. We in the European Union are obliged to integrate the gender dimension into all of our policies and programmes in the field of cooperation, development and humanitarian aid, and to do so from the outset, in the programming of funds.</p>
      <p sl="es">Women are at the centre of the millennium development objectives, approved in 2000 by all of the member countries of the United Nations. It is therefore essential to promote gender equality.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I want to thank Commissioner Špidla and Mrs Sartori for their excellent work. Women constitute 52% of Europeans and expect equality, together with the right to work full time and on equal wages, to be at the top of the political agenda of the EU as a whole. At present, all women in the EU work free for eight weeks, that is to say they receive 15% lower wages than the average man. Women want both jobs and families. Child care and care of the elderly are therefore required – if we want more children in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On International Women’s Day, we Swedish Social Democratic women launched an appeal for free abortion. The right to abortion is threatened again. We must halve the number of women and children involved in people trafficking and prostitution within ten years, achieve a situation in which every other MEP is a woman and, by the next European Parliament elections in 2009, every other candidate is a woman and bring about closer cooperation with good and decent men. The road map must be evaluated regularly if it is to be a political force in Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The women of Europe are now taking the next step towards gender equality, and I believe that the outcome will be a good one.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here it comes, at last, to be debated in this plenary – the Commission’s roadmap for the equality of women and men for 2006 to 2010.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to say, though – speaking as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – that I still do not understand why such a long period of time had to elapse between its being first tabled and discussed in the Committee on Employment and the debate on it in this plenary today.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particularly in view of the fact that the EU is the source of a very large number of initiatives aimed at giving equal status to women and men – something that might otherwise not have made so much progress in the Member States – we should take care not to lose so much time in the progress of this through Parliament, which has now been dragging on for almost over nine months. In the committee, there was agreement among us that, despite great progress having been made, women still suffered considerable discrimination, and that women are particularly subject to the effects of globalisation and changes in population.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two aspects of this to which I would like to draw your attention. Over 40% of all employment in the EU is what is described as ‘non-standard’ in form, and it is predominantly women who are affected by this. I am very pleased to hear Commissioner Špidla say that the intention was that there should be a review of the degree to which conditions had changed for self-employed women too.</p>

      <p sl="sk">This report is the outcome of the joint endeavour of all members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, notwithstanding their diverse political views. In particular, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mrs Amalie Sartori.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This year is symbolic in several ways. On the occasion of the European Community’s anniversary we are also celebrating the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, and we are about to adopt the equality roadmap. The timing is also symbolic. Just a few days ago we marked International Women’s Day. I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to a number of issues.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The equality roadmap makes no sense unless we speak about how women and men can complement each other and harmonise their activities. No European or national equality roadmap will succeed unless the poorest and most vulnerable women become our partners. Efforts to improve the financial and social situation of women will fail unless we recognise officially the contribution women are making to the informal economy, and unless we acknowledge the contribution of women towards sustaining intergenerational solidarity networks.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to highlight the role of non-governmental organisations. Their initiatives are quite important at the national and European level. I urge the European Commission to look for ways specifically to ensure that various budget headings are used to benefit all women’s organisations. In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the equality agenda is not the exclusive domain of women; men must also be actively involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Sartori for the excellent work she has done. By a happy coincidence, we find that we are about to approve the roadmap within a few days of 8 March, as Mrs Záborská has said. International Women’s Day on 8 March is celebrated in many countries around the world, though not all. Last year we had news of police baton charges in Turkey; this year we have heard that young women about to celebrate 8 March in Teheran have been arrested.</p>
      <p sl="it">Like Labour Day, International Women’s Day arose out of the Socialist Movement and was international from the start. The eighth of March 1908 was bread and roses day. Fifteen thousand women marched through New York demanding bread, symbolising a wage and work, and also roses, meaning the right to vote, free time, children’s rights, dignity and respect. Two years later in Copenhagen, the Socialist International proposed marking a definite international women’s day in the calendar, in memory of New York.</p>
      <p sl="it">A hundred years on, if we look closely at the six priority action areas in the roadmap, we find a remarkable similarity between them and the demands of the women who marched under the banner of ‘bread and roses’. They were demanding bread, meaning work and a wage, while we are demanding equal economic independence; they were demanding the right to vote, while we are demanding balanced participation in representative bodies; they were demanding respect for children, while we are demanding childcare services; they were demanding roses, meaning quality of life, while we are demanding the eradication of all forms of violence in order to improve the quality and dignity of life.</p>
      <p sl="it">In those days, however, nobody spoke about eliminating sexist stereotypes. Today I think that one of the reasons why we still need to demand ‘bread and roses’ is that sexist stereotypes still exist in everyday life. I believe priority should be given to fighting stereotypes. Achieving this objective will make it easier, or perhaps just less difficult, to promote equality between men and women in every area.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, last spring the British magazine The Economist proclaimed that women’s power was the main engine of the global economy. We want to make the European economy more competitive and more innovative. It is therefore not enough that women should enter the labour market in vast numbers: they should also be getting managerial positions in the public and private sectors, where their skills can be used to full advantage.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Studies show that companies with a lot of women in senior management posts are more profitable than those where there are few female managers. A determined strategy to promote the status of women would give the European economy a new boost and would improve its position in the competition against the United States of America and the Asian countries. This is the sort of determination I require of the EU and hope that it will show.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Women in Western Europe overtook men in levels of education a long time ago. Academic achievements, however, have not led to a greater number of women in managerial positions in society or the business world. The proportion of women on the Boards of Directors of European companies is still in single figures.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The barriers to progress in the careers of educated women in Europe are rooted not in true discrimination but in corporate culture, attitudes, prejudice and stereotypes. There are also barriers which can be reduced through political decisions. Examples include the reconciliation of work and family life and a fair share of the costs of parenthood.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Regrettably, I do have to say that what the EU has done on the road to equality has not been sufficient, nor has it been effective. There is much talk and there are aspirations, but action and the political will have unfortunately been lacking.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Mrs Sartori on the quality of her report. I believe that respect for women’s rights should in principle be regarded as a sine qua non in assessing whether a candidate country should join the European Union or not. I would say that the Copenhagen criteria ought to refer explicitly to respect for women’s rights. We highlighted it in this House last month, when we were debating the status of women in Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the dawn of the third millennium, women in Europe still have to fight for the right to literacy, equal pay, access to high-level public positions, participation in politics and physical safety. In that respect, I fully endorse the demand that the Member States should severely punish any doctors who agree to perform painful, humiliating tribal practices, particularly female genital mutilation, just for the sake of financial gain or because of a dangerous and distorted respect for other cultures.</p>
      <p sl="it">As for the traffic in women for use in prostitution that is carried on by criminal organisations, I staunchly support the demand that the Member States that have not yet done so should ratify the protocol supplementing the so-called ‘Palermo Protocol’ on combating the trafficking of immigrants. In that respect, I suggested to the Council and Commission back in 2004 that we should set up a centre to monitor Mafia-like organised crime in the European Union precisely so as to enhance our understanding of the extent and causes of criminal networks in Europe and to propose measures to combat them.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is pointless to hide the fact, Madam President, that trafficking in human beings is among the most profitable of these gangs’ activities. Three years have gone by since then, but on this front Europe has remained at the good intentions stage rather than moving on to take action. I hope that the equality roadmap at least will have better luck.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union – which, this month, will be celebrating 50 years of its own existence – may well, in the past, have set milestones for equality of opportunity, its ‘Gender Roadmap’ has turned out to be a dead letter. Describing it as a ‘timetable for action’ cannot disguise the fact that it is a hotch-potch of truisms that the women of Europe cannot expect will advance their cause. Unequal pay, discrimination against women in the social security and pensions systems and their lack of representation in decision-making positions are pressing issues, and to them the Commission has no answers to give. Where there should be proposals for further legal initiatives, there are only fine-sounding words, but we in this House want more than fine-sounding words and lofty sentiments; we want real proposals for legislation. It is not acceptable that the Commission should take a break from equality policy. We must not simply take lying down the fact that, despite a great deal of European legislation, women in Europe earn on average 15% less than their male counterparts, and, in Germany, the earnings gap is as much as 26%. The European Union must, at last, say how it proposes to get rid of this inequality in earnings and what it is going to do about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Efforts at balancing work and family life also need a tail wind from Europe; one is long overdue. No proposal has been forthcoming from the Commission as to how it proposes to support women and their families; what we could do with is a European framework directive on the subject, for it is not enough to talk about families or women, and action, rather than empty words, is what is called for.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs Sartori for her constructive work. The Commission communication on the road map concerns a variety of areas in which gender equality is a priority, for example the promotion of women’s and men’s equal participation in decision-making. The Commission considers these matters to be important, then. I venture to suggest, however, that the Commission’s interest in making its own contribution to promoting women’s participation in decision-making is beneath contempt.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I say this because, as recently as on 6 March of this year, the Commission President appointed an advisory group on the important issues surrounding energy and the climate. The group consists of 11 people, of whom just one is a woman. So much for priorities. As long as the EU institutions behave like that, they will, unfortunately, lack credibility. All road maps, resolutions, statements etc will, then, be worth no more than the paper they are written on.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Women’s rights and the work done on equality must give rise to practical measures, as many of us women have become weary of hearing fine words about equal rights. We demand action, not words. I have long maintained that we should make some progress towards gender equality if we had a Commissioner responsible only for issues of that nature and if we were to ensure that decisions and resolutions were actually put into effect. I still believe that this would be a practical step forward. (Applause)</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we could no doubt write tons of documents on human rights and dignity, and produce a great many opinions and reports on equality and equal rights for women and men. The situation will not improve, however, until we apply ourselves to educating every individual in the spirit of respect for ethical principles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We cannot hope to achieve our aims in terms of an ideal moral, individual or social order unless we ensure respect for moral standards and a sound value system. Women’s just struggle for equality and equal rights must not result in the so-called masculinisation of women. When women set out to resemble men they sacrifice their worth, their dignity and their special beauty. All this goes hand in hand with false and humiliating slogans on sexual and reproductive health, self-fulfilment and equal rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a growing tendency to undervalue the family as an institution, along with marriage and procreation. When this is coupled with a contraceptive and abortionist mentality, unrestricted free will, extreme individualism, conflicts between parents and children and a higher retirement age for women it all contributes to women being perceived as mere chattels. Women are being overburdened and this is resulting in the collapse of their physical and mental health and in greater social malaise, which tends to affect women most.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We recently celebrated International Women’s Day. In that connection, I should like to pay tribute to His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who died two years ago, and say how much I appreciated his encyclical Mulieris Dignitatem.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, equality policies have been laid down at the European level for nearly 50 years, yet, despite all our policy-making efforts, both at the European level and in the Member States – to which many speakers have made reference – we have not yet succeeded in reducing the disadvantages under which women labour.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is right, then that the European Union should not stop highlighting where action is needed to address such problems as violence against women, the lower pay they earn for doing the same work, poverty among women, discrimination against women in the pensions field, and so on. All these issues, I believe, need to be addressed and taken up again and again, and it is for that reason that I welcome the Commission’s gender equality roadmap and would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, for her good own-initiative report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would not, however, wish to gloss over the fact that I cannot agree with it in every detail. One criticism made in the report is that the Commission has not submitted any new proposals for legislation, but I have to admit that I am quite happy that it has not done anything about this. It has, admittedly, announced that it will be reviewing, updating and, possibly, revising the existing legislation, but the Commission has done the right thing in taking account of the allocation of powers in this area to the Member States on the one hand and the EU on the other, instead of offering new proposals as part of its timetable straight away. I am very glad to see this, and so I cannot go along with Mrs Breyer’s words of criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report also calls for the introduction of quotas, in research, for example, and that I reject as well, believing as I do that, in research, the criterion of excellence must apply, but nothing else, so that is a demand that I cannot endorse. Time does not permit me to discuss in detail the other provisions in which the prerogatives of the Member States come under attack, for example the demand for mandatory paternity leave throughout Europe, which I find unacceptable.</p>

The report addresses many important areas such as equal wages for equal work, male violence against women, paternity leave etc. – issues in relation to which gender equality really must be given practical expression and be enhanced. In this area, all the Member States have a big responsibility for ensuring that the report is not just stuffed into a desk drawer and forgotten and that, instead, real work is done to bring about a more equal Europe. I should also like, however, to address, in particular, each and every man as, without men’s participation in this important work, we shall never have gender equality in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last Thursday saw the celebration of International Women’s Day. The Swedish newspapers had page after page about gender equality, as, presumably, did newspapers throughout Europe. What I find annoying is how much worse they are at raising this issue on other days of the year. One only has to look at the gap between women’s and men’s wages, with women’s wages still 15% lower than men’s in Europe, and this in spite of the right to equal wages being stated as far back as in the Treaty of Rome. It is remarkable that we have not made more progress on this issue in 50 years. I have great hopes of the Commission communication on this important issue and of the equality road map for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we know that the road on which we are travelling in the fight for equal rights and opportunities is a long one. For Portuguese women, 8 March was a particularly momentous day. The law decriminalising the voluntary termination of pregnancy, if the woman chooses to do so in the first ten weeks of pregnancy, in a legally authorised health establishment, was finally adopted. There remain many inequalities, however, between women and men, in the social field – in terms of access to work, career development and pay – in political life and in family life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission must not restrict itself to a statement of general principles on equality, which will always be undermined when liberal policies are pursued, with the liberalisation and privatisation provided for in the so-called Lisbon Strategy, to which flexicurity – to facilitate groundless dismissals – can now be added. In this context discrimination against women will go on.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Motherhood and fatherhood, which are key social values, must be afforded state protection. Measures must moreover be taken to eradicate discriminatory practices in companies, which still go on in Portugal. Consequently, as on 2 March in Lisbon, women will continue to fight for more jobs with rights, against the closure of maternity wards and for more crèches and nurseries. Their struggle must be met with a positive response.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Through the indispensable role that they play in society, women have a significant involvement in shaping our ever-changing world. They are involved as mothers, wives, owners of family businesses, professionals and managers of large companies. They make successful politicians, artists and sportswomen. They are agents of progress, making the world a better, more worthwhile place.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even though women possess admirable managerial skills and perform remarkably well in the business sector, in Central Europe men are two times more likely to succeed as entrepreneurs than women. To a large extent, this is due to the fact that women in executive positions are forced to face many additional challenges, notably to do with their role in the family. To attain the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, Europe needs to boost the employment of women by ensuring good working conditions. By the same token, in order to stand up to the challenges of a globalising world, Europe must promote demographic recovery through a mix of family policies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A stable family in which the woman plays her unique role as the giver of life is a basic precondition for stability and prosperity in Europe. Recently published statistics suggest that the birth rate has plummeted in an unprecedented way during the past few years. This calls for thorough analysis of the situation and requires solutions that will enable us to escape from the current demographic predicament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The arguments I have mentioned corroborate the importance of this discussion of the own-initiative report by the rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, who I would like to congratulate and thank for her work. The report, however, contains some problematic and sensitive points, such as quota implementation and reproductive health. Unless we manage to muster enough courage and strength to protect human life, to encourage lifestyles based on traditional family values and to protect families with children, in a couple of years we will end up at an impasse.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not think that women need quotas to elevate them to politics, science or business. What they need is for us to put the conditions in place to enable them to enter the labour market and retain their positions there. It is essential to dismantle all remaining forms of discrimination, such as wage gaps and unequal treatment in the implementation of pension schemes. I am convinced that only a roadmap with this vision of gender equality in its sights will ensure prosperity …</p>

В моята страна този процент е по-висок от средния. Това, според мен, е формално и се дължи на няколко причини. Равнопоставеността стои на вниманието на обществото и то има волята въпросът да се реши за използване на потенциала на жените и на мъжете.

      <p sl="hu">I know that many are wary of the current solution of positive discrimination in order to achieve gender equality. But if there is no other solution, then we need to examine this option as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me, as a member of the International Olympic Commission, to draw your attention to the fact that around 40% of the participants in the Olympic Games are women, and yet their participation in the organisation of the Olympic movement was completely negligible. To solve this problem, in the late 1990s the IOC worked out a strict quota system and said that within ten years, the number of women involved in decision-making processes must reach 20%. This is not a large number, but I am nonetheless pleased to report that this effort has already brought fine results.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Returning specifically to the report, allow me to speak of the question of equal opportunity within the field of physical education and sport in schools. The student bodies in Europe’s schools form quite diverse multicultural communities, in which various ethnic and religious minorities are represented. In the case of Muslim girls, it is quite difficult to find a solution for them to participate in physical education. On the one hand, there is the struggle for gender equality and the equal right of girls and women to physical education, and on the other hand the need to respect cultural diversity, or in other words, the right of ethnic groups to maintain their practices of separating the sexes. I nevertheless maintain that it is very important for Muslim girls to take part in physical education at school, even if important considerations arise which hinder this participation, such as for instance specific dress codes; the widespread existence of coeducational schools; the limits on physical exercise during the month of Ramadan, and cultural expectations regarding dance classes and other extra-curricular activities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, gender equality policy must be perceived as a fundamental requirement linked to respect for the individual’s rights. The Commission’s new Roadmap for equality between women and men does not, however, contain a single new legislative measure. In addition, no financial resources are allocated to the implementation of the very important recommendations contained in this document, such as the swift introduction of national regulations to help women be active on the labour market whilst enjoying equal rights and on the principle of equal pay for equal work. No resources are allocated either to the implementation of specific strategies for the promotion of female entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this regard, the European Commission should give priority to undertaking a review of the Council directive aimed at the alignment of national legislation relating to the implementation of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women. Particular attention should be paid to provisions on workplace inspections and to the appeal procedures available for discrimination against women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the equal rights policy to be successfully implemented, the Member States should designate, at national level, a specific body to deal with gender equality issues. This body would be responsible for assistance in creating and reviewing national plans, and would also monitor their implementation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, priority should be given to policy to reconcile working and family life, and to increasing the access to services caring for those who are dependent on others. The Commission should also become involved in research on violence against women and table a suitable draft directive on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, respect for women’s rights must be an essential condition of the European Union’s neighbourhood, foreign and development policies towards third countries. It is well known that the media exert a strong influence on citizens’ outlook. Accordingly, if positive examples of the achievements of female role models in various areas were disseminated, for instance in the framework of the MEDIA 2007 programme, this might prove an effective way of combating the widespread negative stereotyping that still exists.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, thank you for the debate, which clearly demonstrates that the issue of equal opportunities remains one of the most important in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am delighted that virtually all of the proposals put forward are in some way contained in the roadmap for equality between men and women. I also note the fully justified comment that despite 30 years of the directive on equal pay, there is still no equal pay. This is a more complex problem than can be solved by a single directive; it is a problem involving prejudice, education and segregation in the labour market. The Commission has therefore decided to make equal pay one of its key issues. This is moreover why we have had studies carried out and have proposed communications that attempt to take effective action in this area in such a way that we can achieve tangible results. Up to now the results have not been particularly good.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I also welcome the fact that the issue of reconciling family and work life was brought to the fore. I would point out that we have taken the first steps and it is clear that this goes beyond mere technical adjustments to the work environment; it is a broader problem that touches on the fair division of tasks in life between men and women. There remains a great deal to do in this area. I feel, for example, that the Barcelona Strategy has not been implemented as fully as had been planned.</p>
      <p sl="cs">What was also highlighted was the strengthening of the proportion of women in management positions. This is a fundamental issue. The Commission was strongly criticised for the fact that there are very few women in the climate change and energy group. I should just like to point out that the current Commission has eight female Commissioners and the Commission’s Secretary-General is a woman. The female Commissioners are in charge of very important portfolios, so it is incorrect to say that no progress has been made. The situation of women in Turkey was also mentioned. I should like to highlight the fact that I am firmly committed to equal opportunities, which form part of the Copenhagen criteria, being treated with the utmost seriousness. This means that countries in which there is no equality of opportunities should not be allowed accession to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">When it comes to debates on cultural difference, sexual mutilations and particular cultural environments, I should like to point out that human rights and equal opportunities, in my view, take precedence over any cultural considerations. It is up to us to ensure that these rights are upheld in a sensitive manner.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As regards affirmative action, I feel, firstly, that this is permitted under European law, and that secondly, it is inaccurate to think of it as positive discrimination, because rather than giving preferential treatment, joint affirmative action redresses unfair burdens and balances opportunities. Quotas were mentioned a great deal and I am fully aware of the many cases in which women have been barred from a particular position simply on account of being female, having fulfilled all the other conditions. I therefore feel that the question of affirmative action is one on which we should keep a close eye and an open mind.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, I should like once again to thank Mrs Sartori. After all, this own-initiative report is one that contains a wide range of important points, which we will undoubtedly make use of in our joint efforts towards guaranteeing the highest level of equality between men and women.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs for the overwhelming support they have given me. The unanimous support of the Committee on Legal Affairs was a great honour and privilege for me.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by underlining the importance of the copyright sector, which represents 5-7 % of the EU’s GDP. It is therefore important to ensure that copyright and neighbouring rights in this increasingly growing digital domain are managed properly to the benefit of all involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, I have to say that I am not at all happy with the ‘soft law’ approach taken by the Commission, since it failed to involve the European Parliament and the Member States in regulating this area, which is of growing economic importance and therefore absolutely relevant to the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has set a precedent in a very important and sensitive domain: by failing to consult Parliament or the Council, it has bypassed the democratic process. I believe we all agree that the legislative triangle cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am fully committed to the preservation of European cultural diversity. I believe that this issue should be placed in the front line of the debate. Any potential negative effects on cultural diversity in Europe must be avoided.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Committee on Culture and Education has done an excellent job in highlighting the undesirable implications – one could even say negative effects – for cultural diversity of the Commission’s recommendation. As you may have noticed, the Culture Committee’s major concerns and demands, as well as compromise suggestions from all parties, are reflected in my report before you.</p>
      <p sl="en">Summarising my report, I would like to say that my proposal preserves the reciprocal system of collecting societies in Europe, but makes sure that they all respect the principle of good governance. We will encourage and support the introduction of competition among collecting societies in a controlled manner and not the ‘big bang’ approach. We would like to guarantee that individual rights holders can continue to join the collecting society of their choice. We will promote the availability of the world repertoire for all collecting societies – large and small. We will argue for solidarity and equal treatment between authors and publishers affiliated to collecting societies. We will ensure that a few large rights holders cannot place the repertoire they control exclusively in the hands of a few large collecting societies, thereby creating an oligopoly situation in Europe. We would like to ensure that users of music from online and mobile services can obtain a one-stop shop when seeking a licence for the whole of Europe, but prevent them from forcing down the level of remuneration for authors. We would like to ensure that collecting societies can continue to play an indispensable role in promoting new and minority repertoire locally.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to emphasise again that, by calling for a directive that reflects these objectives, we will demonstrate our overall support for strong cultural diversity in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the improvement of the report, I tried to cooperate as closely as possible with all the interested parties – above all, the excellent shadow rapporteurs – to find the best and most balanced solution on this culturally and economically important area. I am very grateful for their precious advice and suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="en">My objective has been to find a good balance of interests, a balance between the necessary introduction of competition and cultural diversity, a balance between rights holders and users of music, a balance between big and small collecting societies, a balance between the big rights holders and niche authors and composers. I have tried to propose a European solution in a very difficult and sensitive domain and I hope that it has been successful for the European Union and that we all shall benefit from it.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, honourable Members, I should like, if I may, to thank Mrs Lévai for her report on the Commission recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services. I should like to point out that the catalyst for the Commission recommendation was originally authors’ fears: authors, composers and music publishers warned the Commission that they are not earning royalties from the use of their works on line.</p>
      <p sl="cs">From our analysis it is clear, however, that it is too complicated for individual countries to manage the use of copyright works on line, particularly in a digital environment. As a result of the complex relationships between the collective management organisations (CRMs) policing these rights in each individual country, it seems that royalties do not reach authors and other right-holders. The purpose of the Commission recommendation is therefore to ensure that authors, composers and music publishers do receive their fair share of online royalties.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Similarly, I believe that it is possible to improve the system of issuing licences in such a way that it facilitates the development of new online services while also protecting and providing genuine support for the interests of copyright-holders. To put it clearly, the recommendation does not propose a concrete model for issuing licences, but puts forward the principle that when it comes to managing their online rights, right-holders should be free to choose the most advantageous and efficient form of management or licensing. The aim therefore is to ensure that right-holders earn royalties from the online use of their music works. This will in turn enable us to ensure complete protection for the value of the right-holders’ works. This is in no way a race to the bottom. This objective serves the interests of rights-holders and is reflected in the recommendation’s regulations relating to administering transparency, resolving disputes, the responsibilities of copyright managers and the balanced representation of all categories of copyright-holders on the boards of CRMs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s overwhelming support for this report. Even though we are still monitoring the impact of the recommendation and gathering the opinions of the interested parties, a number of initiatives have already been put in place with a view to strengthening management. In 2006, for example, the world trade association of music publishers and the umbrella organisation of European associations for the collective rights of authors adopted a joint statement establishing a set of rules for online copyright management.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Various right-holders including smaller CRMs and publishers have expressed enthusiasm for the business opportunities opened up by the recommendation of online music services. In the issuing of online service licences, the Commission sees an opportunity for the entire EU to acknowledge the value of music and to support different cultures and their musical works throughout the EU. The creation of new markets with specific music genres and the discovery of a genuine Internet public will unquestionably help support cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report calls for the Commission to propose a directive on this issue. The Commission would note that the online market is developing and we must be extremely careful not to restrict its potential with an overly rigid approach. What is more, as I have said before, it is only now that we are looking into what the situation will be like after the recommendation has been adopted. I can assure everyone here that our goal is to guarantee right-holders royalties from their works and the users of rights the necessary licences in the simplest and most straightforward way. I believe it is vital to support and preserve Europe’s cultural diversity. The Commission will naturally keep Parliament informed.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lévai, on her excellent cooperation and the outcome of her important work in the report on collective copyright management.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is a fact that the composition of the committee is an important step towards the future convergence of the various practices in the 27 Member States. I consider that close cooperation between right managers must be maintained for the benefit of all sides. In the digital age in which we live, the effective safeguarding of copyright and related rights is exceptionally important in order to limit piracy and ensure that royalties are paid to right-holders.</p>
      <p sl="el">In its opinion, the Committee on Culture and Education approaches the protection and collective management of copyright from the side both of musical authors or lyricists and composers and interpreters.</p>
      <p sl="el">The present regime, as regards on-line services, is considered not to be adequately effective either for right users or for right-holders. Television and radio stations frequently fail to pay the royalties owed for the repertoire they use in their various broadcasts.</p>
      <p sl="el">All right-holders, be they authors or composers, publishers, disc producers or performers need to be treated equally. However, the biggest problem of the music industry today is still piracy. The present system of mutual collective copyright management must, in my opinion, be maintained, so that competition can be established on the basis of the services which can be produced and the commission charged by collective right managers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as we know, music is not a commodity. That is why we all have a duty to protect and reinforce creativity in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am now speaking in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on Legal Affairs. The Commission’s recommendation for the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights throws up a multitude of problems, for it secures neither the rights of the artists nor the diversity of the music on offer in Europe, and there are gaps in the assessment of its potential impact. The chosen legal remedy is unacceptable; recommending three options at the same time does not really do anything to solve the problem that Mrs Lévai has set out so clearly in her report, and which the compromise before you aims to address. What that means in detail is a ‘no’ to territorial restrictions on use, a ‘yes’ to fair and controlled competition in the collective management of rights, ‘yes’ to the modernisation of the online music market, but not at the expense of cultural diversity and the protection of the artists, and ‘yes’ too to transparent rights management companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is worthy of criticism about all this is that the Commission is trying, by means of a recommendation, to circumvent the rights of this House, and so we call upon it to present, through the codecision procedure, a proposal for a suitable legal instrument, founded, of course, on extensive consultation with all the interested parties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thinking forward to the forthcoming ruling on the CISAC case, I would like to appeal to the Commission not to use ‘soft law’ or agreements as means of voiding Parliament’s rights of codecision, and I ask the Members of this House to give their assent to Mrs Lévai’s report.</p>

    <intervention id="1-150" speaker_id="1337" name="Manuel Medina Ortega" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, both the main report by the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mrs Lévai, and the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, by Mr Mavrommatis, as well as the various speeches we have heard so far, demonstrate that there is considerable consensus amongst the Members of this Parliament with regard to the Commission’s recommendation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, we object to the method being used. The use of a recommendation, of the instrument known as ‘soft law’ at European Union level, is always very dangerous, bearing in mind that the European Union has its own legislative instruments, such as the framework directive proposed by Mrs Lévai.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, there is an objection in terms of content. The Commission’s recommendation may already be producing undesirable effects on the shape of the intellectual property market subject to certain oligopolies, that is to say, the so-called ‘majors’, the main organisations that control radio broadcasting.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission’s recommendation may encourage these ‘majors’ to withdraw their repertoires from the current system of collective rights management societies, which makes it possible to safeguard rights. If that happened, the result would be that the ‘minors’, that is to say, the small organisations protecting intellectual property, would not be able to protect intellectual rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">When it comes to culture, to music, the market is not the most important thing. The most important thing is musical production. The culture of each of the peoples of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not a question of creating a great market, because in a great market the Gresham law would end up being applied, according to which bad money takes the place of good money. In other words, we are on the point of reaching a situation of an entirely unified market, in which a few ‘majors’ or very important organisations will end up monopolising the market, imposing their conditions on authors and ultimately preventing intellectual creativity in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore support the report by Mrs Lévai and the opinion of Mr Mavrommatis, and we do not believe that this is a time to approve any amendment to these reports.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am speaking here as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Legal Affairs on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Whilst we support the gist of the Lévai report as it was approved, we would like to add something, because the objective of the recommendation is to break the monopolies of management societies and make them more transparent thanks to the control measures that are to be put in place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The compromise amendments are imperfect in places, lack either clarity or consistency and even restrict the scope. Our amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow complement the approved report and aim to make it easier to break the monopolies, make the market more transparent whilst ensuring that it becomes workable and that the authors and right-holders are proven right and can collect their compensation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Amendment 5, we ask the Member States to put the licences out to public tender every couple of years, just to keep the monopolistic management societies under pressure. Their monopolies are not a problem per se, but there is no form of control at the moment. A study by the Dutch competition authority has shown that every country uses different guiding principles. Since they are monopolies, it is impossible to inspect them, as a result of which it cannot be verified whether the compensation requested is exorbitant or whether the government costs are exorbitant. This should nevertheless be possible. I hope that this will come off thanks to the amendments we tabled.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, we are seeking, by means of our amendments, to broaden the scope, since, for example, broadcasting – when we talk about transmission via the Internet, i-pods and suchlike – falls within the scope of copy broadcasting, which is now being restricted. We should like to reintroduce this in order to come as close to the original Commission proposal as possible. As matters stand, there has been too much in the way of listening to management societies and not enough listening to right-holders and authors.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are today debating a difficult and controversial issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As regards dealing with the common problem of cross-border management of copyright and related rights regulating legitimate services in the field of online music, I note the lack of Parliament’s formal involvement. I believe this is most inappropriate particularly as the issue was already raised in the resolution of 15 January 2004. I also note a lack of consultation regarding future regulatory work in this area. It is difficult to regulate the legal situation of a particular sector without becoming familiar with the stance of those concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission’s recommendation seeks merely to regulate the online sale of music recordings. Owing to its imprecise wording, however, it could also be applied to other online services such as broadcasting services. The aforementioned lack of precision could lead to uncertainty as to the applicability of various systems of issuing reviews. All this could result in a lack of legal certainty and detrimental effects, especially for online broadcasting services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is also a risk that rightholders complying with the aforementioned recommendation in respect of their interactive online rights would deprive local collective management of copyright entities of other rights such as those relating to broadcasting, thus preventing users from acquiring user rights for a broader and more diversified repertoire from the same collective management of copyright entity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Rightholders should have the possibility of benefiting from protection of copyright and related rights wherever those rights are established for the whole period of their validity, regardless of national boundaries or of the way they are used. A multi-territorial licence system should therefore be established. This would ensure greater legal protection for commercial users in relation to their activity and support the development of legitimate online services, at the same time increasing the flow of income for copyright holders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The freedom to provide cross-border collective management services means that rightholders have a Community-wide free choice of collective management of copyright body, which is essential for the provision of legitimate online music services. This right includes the possibility of entrusting rights to another collective management of rights body or transferring all or some of the online rights, regardless of the European Union country concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that increased but also controlled competition in the area of collective management of copyright and related rights in the music sector on the Internet may prove beneficial to all. Pursuant to the Committee on Culture and Education’s stance, it may also serve to support cultural diversity but only on condition that fair principles and transparency are guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just about lofty conceptions of competition or the free choice of artists, or about the inadequacies of the rights management company system; this is quite clearly about diversity, about the reduction of the market to mass production, or about the upholding of the European quality of diversity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, there are inadequacies, and they do have to be done away with, but I do not believe it is at all possible to do that in the way the Commission has tried to. This report has occasioned a great deal of activity on the part of the lobbyists. We got loads of letters; I am sure you got some too, perhaps from ‘Writers and Composers for Choice’, but, if you read that letter and look at the signatures, you cannot be sure that all the artists actually know what they are supposed to have signed. I know people whose names appear on this list, but had not the least idea that their names were being used by an organisation in a letter of this sort. That shows the efforts of a number of rights management companies that want to create a monopoly for themselves in a poor light.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s approach, the result of which is the recommendation on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services, is unfortunately further evidence of the unacceptable, and indeed completely needless, circumvention of the democratic decision-making process as regards the role of the European Parliament. I should like to highlight a number of points in the report before us, which broadly speaking I welcome and on which I congratulate the rapporteur and those who worked with her. In particular, I wish to highlight the need for the equitable treatment of all rights-holders and the protection of the system of agreements and the free choice of licences as well as higher levels of protection for right-holders.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As regards the issue of future competition, attention should be paid to the possible misuse of monopolies when it comes to the collective management of authors’ rights. The more we speak about economic competition across the whole spectrum of intellectual property rights, the more it is vital for that competition to be regulated, controlled and fair. I am highlighting this because provisions aimed at protecting economic competition in the area of intellectual property rights have been extensively applied, and in a number of cases competition is given precedence over the exercise of those rights.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Lévai for her constructive cooperation on the report and the EU observer for its useful conference on creative rights. I should also like to thank Pia Raug who, instead of just giving up, convinced the majority of us.</p>
      <p sl="da">A year ago, the arts were in danger of losing out to the market. People in the Commission were used by multinational companies to implement what is known as a soft-law instrument, which would never have got by elected representatives. Tomorrow, we shall have a large majority in favour of the arts in all their diversity, and the Commission will then withdraw its threats of legal action against copyright managers and shelve its communication on the music market. Writers, composers and users are to be listened to, then. A fresh start should be made with a proposal for a directive that we in the European Parliament too are involved in negotiating.</p>
      <p sl="da">The vast majority of Members of the European Parliament want to ensure an all-round supply of music. We shall never allow the supply to be determined by a handful of multinational companies. We also want to ensure that less visible artists can find their public. As consumers, we will not be satisfied with popular music from only the biggest countries. Nor will we let the multinationals’ friends in the Commission expropriate KODA and other copyright law companies that, every day, make great efforts to ensure the accessibility and equal treatment of music intended for both a broad and a more restricted audience.</p>
      <p sl="da">All users can now be satisfied with one contract with one agency, which then settles up with the others. The system is basically sound but requires more administrative transparency in places. As music users we are happy to pay a fair price to writers and composers, but we want to pay as little as possible to bureaucrats and multinational giants. The Lévai report is a balanced one and does Parliament credit.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I shall begin by saying that I am an associate member of the Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores (Portuguese Authors’ Society), the Portuguese collective rights management society (CRM) in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report by Mrs Levai and Mr Mavrommatis deserves to be adopted. The freedom for authors and composers to be represented by the CRM of their choice is as fundamental a principle as the ban on major publishers entering into exclusive agreements with CRMs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The mandate granted by a major publisher to a given CRM should also be able to be granted to any other CRM. That mandate should, moreover, only be able to include the centralisation of licensing for multinational companies, with the licences for national companies remaining the responsibility of local CRMs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The availability of the global repertoire should be preserved for all collective management societies through licences issued to users. For this reason, as the report says, it is vital to prohibit any form of exclusive mandate between the major right-holders and the collective management societies for the direct collection of royalties in all Member States, given that this would lead to the rapid extinction of national societies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The network of national societies should be preserved so that they all have access to the global repertoire and everything possible must be done to safeguard cultural diversity, in view of the indispensable contribution made by these national societies via what they do in their respective countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That being said, it is at least bizarre that a recommendation by the Commission has been deemed to be the right way to address the issue of CRMs, not least because, according to the Commissioner, the Commission is not yet au fait with the current state of affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission will hopefully welcome the call, in one of the recitals in the report, for it to draw up a proposal for a directive. After all, it is clear that given what is at stake this proposal must be implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

I want to add my voice to the choir of those who have already complained about the process, about the choice of method. The Commission has the right to choose a recommendation, but it is a political choice and it has two effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, in an area like this a soft law instrument may unfortunately give rise to uncertainty, to a lack of legal clarity, but more importantly it avoids this House. It avoids democracy. That cannot be acceptable and I think this is our biggest complaint, not so much about the content, but the way in which this has been done in an attempt avoid the legislator. It seems to me even more startling, having participated in the last mandate of this Parliament, when we had a colleague, Mercedes Echerer, who spent months, even years, working on an own-initiative report in this area. Parliament’s interest in and commitment to this issue were well known, so to find ourselves coming back and being faced with a mere recommendation, with all its difficulties, faults and inconsistencies, is just not good enough. I apologise for not having addressed the substance, but it is the process which concerns me most.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Lévai and Mr Mavrommatis for their excellent proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is timely because intellectual and artistic property is now being called into question in the European Union. On the undoubtedly legitimate grounds of the technology revolution, which is profoundly changing the way in which we access artistic creations and cultural assets, the Commission has been proposing for some months to reduce the pay of authors, composers, performers and all rightholders in general. It fully supports the view shared by manufacturers and consumers that online distribution can be free of charge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I condemn this deadlock, this illusion of free online services. If creators and performers are no longer paid by copyright and related rights, one day there will no longer be any creation, any new music, or any new films. What will we put on the network then?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were able to stop the draft Commission recommendation, which attacked the system of compensation for private copying, but it is still on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In each of our countries, we have transposed the 2001 Directive and safeguarded the status of rightholders. The Commissioner for Competition has decided to put a stop to the territorial scope of national collective rights management societies. The recommendation on the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for online music comes under the same dangerous concept. It has also had a harmful impact, since the German and British societies have created one joint society to which a very important record producer has entrusted the exclusive rights to its international catalogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Levai is therefore right to challenge the Commission option, which relies more on an inadequate consultation process. Her proposal, which safeguards local repertoires, does seem to us, however, to be a little too favourable to distributors and thus carries the risk of dumping, to the detriment of rightholders. However, I hope that this report, in its current form, is adopted so that the Commission knows that, where very sensitive areas are concerned, the European Parliament refuses to see European law escape the legislator and wants all points of view to be taken into consideration without bias. This is also what is meant by cultural diversity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too – just like Mrs Wallis – remember the last mandate of this Parliament, for this House has always had its problems with the rights management companies; I would refer the House back to the Echerer report, in which we demanded of the Commission a specific piece of legislation on their transparency and the regulation of them, to the Zimmerling report, in which this featured, and to the deliberations on the directive on copyright and related rights in the information society.</p>
      <p sl="de">For those reasons alone it is perfectly right and proper that the Commission should be giving thought to how this problem should be handled, for it is not tolerable, in the long run, that there should be twenty-seven monopolies in this field and no internal market, but nor do we want these twenty-seven monopolies to be replaced by a few oligopolies, and that much became abundantly clear from the deliberations we had in committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want, though, to take this opportunity to make it clear that rights management companies do not exist for their own sake alone; they are a sort of necessary evil, existing where they are needed, as mediators between those who create the product and those who use it. Where that is not required – and such a situation is indeed conceivable – no rights management company is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I have learned, though, from many discussions and hearings – and not least from these companies lobbying activities – is that this business is much more complicated than we had originally thought. In the course of the process, a lot of stakeholders changed their minds; the big management companies suddenly decided that they were all for liberalisation, because they worked out that the market would give them the chance to form an oligopoly, while many users suddenly changed their minds and decided against all-out liberalisation, in which they saw more drawbacks than benefits for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is needed here, quite simply, is the very careful drafting of any proposal for legislation; it is self-evident that we have to do something about this, and that things cannot carry on the way they are, but our expectation is that the Commission should actually produce that proposal, and that we should then be able to get to grips with it with all the ways and means afforded by parliamentary debate. That is the crucial message that this report carries, and that is also what we expect of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As far as boosting the growth of online music services within Europe is concerned, we agree with the Commission on the fact that the development of these services hinges on a change in the systems of collective management and of the granting of copyright licences at Community level. Indeed, these improvements have become necessary as a result of the emergence of new services such as Internet radio, streaming and downloading services for which a fee must be paid. The absence of a copyright licence in the EU has been one of the obstacles preventing new Web-based music services from reaching their full potential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the European institutions must legislate with caution on collective management systems, which are highly complex. In particular, they should keep a very close eye on the excesses of a system in which the freedom of rightholders to freely choose a management society within the EU would result in a concentration of rights and would undermine cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, we endorse the majority of the rapporteur’s comments, together with the idea that a rights manager must be authorised to supply commercial users with a pan-European, multi-repertoire licence for the online use of musical repertoires, throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Lévai, and congratulating her on her work on the European Parliament resolution before us today. Technical progress and the development of our civilisation have resulted in the emergence of a new generation of cross-border commercial copyright users. They are the suppliers of Internet music services. This shows how the market in copyright and related rights is evolving and developing, which further confirms the need for the initiatives taken in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proper development of the European music market calls for a study to be undertaken on the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences for online music services and of the effects related to the socio-economic situation of the rightholders. It is also important to ensure that the European market in online music services is able to develop freely without detriment to European cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament resolution before us today deserves our support. Nonetheless, it is essential for the Commission to undertake an in depth study of this problem. The results of the study should be submitted to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, I should like to point out that as we engage in this debate we should also bear in mind how we might respond to future needs resulting from the nature of collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/49/EEC and Directives 2002/83/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2005/68/EC and 2006/48/EC as regards procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector (COM(2006)0507 C6-0298/2006 2006/0166(COD)) (A6-0027/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-165" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular Mr Klinz for his excellent report on prudential assessments in the financial sector and for the amount of effort that has gone into achieving a common position between the three institutions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We share Mr Klinz’s view that this proposed directive will make the whole approach to acquisitions in the financial sector more effective. We must clearly ensure that commercial decisions on acquisitions in the financial sector are clearly and transparently vetted by the relevant body. Legitimate commercial decision-making must not be frustrated by overzealous bodies or by political interference. Where both the acquirer and his target are under inspection, the bodies responsible must work together, exchange information and help each other out. This will serve to speed up the assessments process.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is frequently said that we should not indiscriminately open our doors to the invasion of capital from third countries or to the takeover of our institutions by big business. I firmly believe that even though we have to protect the interests of our markets, our institutions and our consumers, we must continue to honour our commitments in international forums such as the WTO. We must also ensure that our trading partners also honour their commitments. The current state of affairs is most encouraging. Several institutions based in the EU have successfully penetrated third countries where they have concluded mergers and takeovers in the financial sector. At the same time, however, we should not overlook problems in the EU, where organisations from some Member States have faced problems relating to the acquisition of firms in other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The purpose of this directive is neither to encourage nor to discourage acquisitions in the financial sector. Our objective must not be to disturb the normal functioning of the market. We must ensure, however, that there is a solid framework in place leading to the assessment, and then the approval or rejection, of potential acquisitions. The key point here is that prudential assessments must not become the mere exercise of discretionary powers, as this would result in delays and obstructions and would be ineffective and uneconomic. Also covered in the report are issues of hostile as opposed to friendly takeovers. Hostile takeovers are part and parcel of the normal functioning of the market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission believes that the authorities should adopt a position in favour of such initiatives or against them. Irrespective of whether an initiative is friendly or hostile, the decision rests with the shareholders. There need to be willing sellers in any acquisition. If, according to the directive, the prudential criteria have been met, there is no reason to query the value of agreements between willing purchasers and sellers.</p>
      <p sl="cs">To summarise: clear, fair and predictable approaches and processes are of vital importance to the proper functioning of the internal market. I believe that with this directive we will remove the current ambiguity. Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="1-166" speaker_id="28244" name="Wolf Klinz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after a mere six months, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have come to an agreement on the revision of the directive on the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is thanks to the prompt work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and to the purposeful trilogue negotiations that it will be possible to complete this dossier before spring is out, on the assumption that ECOFIN, on 27 March, agrees to it. That is visible evidence to the public that Europe, even with twenty-seven Member States, is capable of taking action and capable of taking important decisions quickly, even – as the Commissioner has just described – with a complex dossier such as this one.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for that reason that I should like, at the beginning of my speech, to briefly thank all those concerned for their good cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs Mr Purvis and Mr Muscat, the chairman of the Committee Mrs Berès, and all those Members who have helped to make it a matter of probability that the directive will, tomorrow, be adopted by all of us, from whatever political grouping, in a block vote.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to highlight the constructive cooperation with the representatives of the Mediterranean states, whom we have been able to convince that their concerns about the fragmented shareholder structure that is so widespread in their countries have been taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last of all, I extend warm thanks to the Finnish and German Presidencies of the Council and to the Commission, which have competently accompanied our project and ensured smooth cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need this revised directive. In the past, on more than one occasion, individual enterprises have failed to acquire shareholdings in other countries or to take over whole companies in them, simply for lack of an unambiguous legal framework that would have laid down uniform assessment criteria and hence a uniform procedure for the supervisory authorities. That will now change.</p>
      <p sl="de">The object of the draft directive put forward by the Commission last autumn is greater legal certainty, undoubted reliability and clearly-demarcated decision-making processes, and, since all the interested parties are agreed on these, we have therefore supported it. All three institutions – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – believe that this is the direction in which we must go and that the highest possible degree of harmonisation is needed if people in all the Member States of the European Union are to be able to participate in the market under what really are equal conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, there were, inevitably, differences of opinion on one point or another, particularly as regards the test period or what alternative courses of action might be available if the decision turned out to be negative, that is to say if the application for the acquisition of a shareholding or for the takeover of a whole business were to be turned down. It did, however, eventually prove possible, through negotiations, for these problems to be resolved and for us to reach a consensus.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, then, cross-border mergers of credit institutions, insurance companies and investment firms will be made increasingly easier, and there are four reasons why this is the case. Firstly, the supervisory authorities will, in future, have at most sixty days in which to rule on an increase in a holding. That period will be able to be interrupted only once, and for a period of twenty days, for the purpose of obtaining further information when the potential acquirer is from another EU Member State, or for thirty days if from a third country.</p>
      <p sl="de">Distinguishing in this way between companies from the EU and those from third countries takes account of the fact that the latter’s supervisory and market structures are often not identical with those in the European Union, and that European authorities are therefore not always fully informed about circumstances in those countries. It follows that the supervisory authorities must be allowed more time in which to obtain and evaluate specific information, while the companies from third states also need more time in which to prepare, translate and submit such information. The different suspension periods make both these things possible without breaking WTO rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the five test criteria are unambiguous and final, and they enable the Member States to use them to define the list of specific information that the potential acquirer must submit, which must include the mode of acquisition of the shareholding and the nature of the potential acquirer, so that less information will need to be sought in the event of straightforward and clearly understandable increases in holdings than in the case of those that are more complex and may involve more than one sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">The intention is that, two years following the entry into force of this directive, the Commission will conduct a review to establish whether the requests for information are relatively similar across the Member States or whether a divergence is becoming apparent, and it may well be that the Commission will have to intervene and ensure that no such divergences occur.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, the supervisory authorities are required to cooperate closely, although it is specifically laid down that the final decision rests with the authority with jurisdiction over the targeted company, and it is this authority that must also give the reasons for any adverse decision. It is not planned that the publication of those reasons be made mandatory, but the company whose plans for acquisition were thus turned down will be able to demand it. It is equally possible that individual Member States will publish the reasons in accordance with their own laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, the Commission wanted, for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with the directives, to have direct access to the documentation, but that we refused. Our reason for doing so is that the directive will, in future, make for greater legal certainty and clarity. I am firmly persuaded that this will amount to a further step closer to more cross-border consolidations and hence to an increasing integrated internal market.</p>

    <intervention id="1-167" speaker_id="729" name="John Purvis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Klinz for all his valiant work in getting this agreed. Although we support the compromise with the Council, it does water down the Commission’s original intent and, frankly, the Commission’s original text would have been better in our view. Mr Klinz, as I say, strove valiantly to keep as close as possible to the original intent and to improve on it. My group would have been happy to have tightened it, with more transparency and less wriggle room for protectionists.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s original deadline of 30 days for a prudential assessment has been extended up to a possible 90 days for non-EU acquirers, but the crucial point here is that at least there will be an absolute deadline. Thus, we can hope to avoid situations where a protectionist regulator can block a takeover by delaying tactics. In the interests of transparency, we would have preferred disclosure of the reasons for a supervisor’s decision, and this would have helped to develop a body of precedent and common practice around the EU. Sadly, there is a continuing preference in some Member States for secrecy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, the threat of hedge funds was raised in the context of amendments tabled by my group, which were designed to avoid difficulties for investment managers. We must get away from this knee-jerk reaction to hedge funds and private equity funds. They are helping to improve our economy just because they are active and demanding shareholders.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope now that supervisors will be persuaded to work more and more closely together, exchanging information and building up relationships of trust. It is in their own interest and, more importantly, it is in the interests of the financial services industry and of the whole EU economy. We are working towards a more open and competitive European market in financial services. This particular result is not all that I and my group would have wished. The fault for this lies mostly with the Council of Ministers, but we will be watching to see that it is operated in a proper spirit, rather than using every possible loophole and ambiguity to obstruct it. We must turn lip-service to the Lisbon Agenda into action, and this is one small step in that direction.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-168" speaker_id="28121" name="Joseph Muscat" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="mt">The obvious result of this work is that we now have a clear timetable for how long regulators will take to carry out a procedure in the field of takeovers, and I believe that the remarkable result we have achieved is due to the excellent work of Mr Klinz and to the work we did together. As with any compromise, we would obviously have all liked some things to have happened differently. However, I feel that we have achieved a very good result. I wholly agree with Mr Purvis that we now have a specific number of days at the end of which a decision will be taken regarding takeovers, and this is the greatest achievement that has taken place during these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I also believe we have improved on the work of the Commission because we are giving the regulators the time needed to do their work. It is futile to try to exert pressure in order to shorten the amount of time required to take a decision if this ultimately leads to a situation of more haste, less speed. In this field, I believe that regulators, especially the small ones with fewest resources, must be given all the time they need in order properly to come to considered decisions on important matters such as this. I believe that this is an extremely judicious step towards achieving a transparent and European perspective in this field. Finally, although it is, unfortunately, technically impossible to include them in this legislation, the aspects we must take into consideration in advance include the social and corporate governance perspective in the field of takeovers. This is not strictly related to the field of legislation, but it is an area that our citizens are asking us to consider in depth.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and support the ideas expressed by many colleagues. However, I would also like to mention another aspect, quite often forgotten, especially by members of our Commission; namely, that we are talking about a process that is not new. Financial groups are already operating in the European Union, and we know that for the uniform development of each country's market we have to ensure that these major groups do not crowd smaller enterprises out of the market, as these are the innovators and they are not in a position to trample the interests of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I can give you an example of my own country, where the major financial groups are so well established that they make profits of 90%, which clearly demonstrates that customers are suffering. In other words, when making decisions about company acquisitions and takeovers and the formation of new financial groups, we must let the supervising bodies assess the structure of these groups and the extent to which these new financial groups will be amenable to innovation and will manage to respect their clients' needs.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We surely cannot overlook the fact that, while we are currently occupied with the activities of financial groups, they have still not clearly specified what would happen if one of their subsidiary firms in one country or another were not operating effectively, and, let us say, it were to go bankrupt. We still have no reply as to who would compensate the clients.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I think this is a complex problem, one that has to do with organising better supervision. Therefore, an essential part of the process is the supervision of mergers and capital enlargement in the financial market in such a way that it would be possible to defend the interests of small enterprises and consumers.</p>

    <intervention id="1-170" speaker_id="4292" name="Alexander Radwan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for today’s outcome is a very positive one, in that it was achieved rapidly through the good cooperation of the Commission, Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">The reason why a speedy result was necessary was that at the nation state level, there is an increase in protectionism, not only in the financial sector but also in others, for any Member State will be pleased if a company based there can invest in another country and take over businesses in it, but heaven help a company from another country that tries to do likewise; that is when they pull out all the stops and get tough, not only in the financial sector, but also in energy, as we have seen, for example, with Endesa and E.ON.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why action to deal with this became necessary. I am glad that it was possible to agree on criteria and deadlines, but I have my misgivings about the role played in the debate by the supervisory bodies, who, back in the days of the ‘Basel II’ debate, had not done very much to clarify how they were supposed to monitor the integration of financial markets. In saying this, I am certainly not advocating a European supervisory body, but, given the way the supervisory bodies in Europe have organised things, their primary interest is in staking out their national boundaries, and so the first move should come from us at the European level, and from the Commission, with an invitation being extended to the supervisors to engage in dialogue on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to say something about hedge funds, which Mr Purvis has already mentioned; although I agree with him wholeheartedly that these should not be demonised, I would like to see discussions – which I believe should include other parts of the world in particular – about the need for the Commission to act in this area, to conduct a one-off evaluation – of the kind that has become a permanent feature in other areas – of how hedge funds should be handled, of how the utterances from the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank on the stability of the financial markets should be understood, and to make a presentation on the subject. Having heard what this House has had to say to the Commission, I get the impression that someone is now refusing to put in the work, and I would be delighted if someone were to pick up this ball and make progress in this area. Commissioner Špidla, there seem to be a lot of proposals being made in your area of responsibility, so perhaps you can fire up Commissioner McCreevy with the ambition to do likewise.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, cross-border issues and the acquisition of shares in banks, insurance and investment companies are less than in other sectors. One barrier is the uncertainty in the procedures for prudential assessments before national supervisors, given the lack of criteria on the unity of the acquirer and the detailed regulation of the procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposed directive deals with these problems and harmonises their treatment. The amendments approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs make the requirements clearer, facilitate supervisory action, protect confidentiality and improve control. Their result in general is positive and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Klinz.</p>
      <p sl="es">One sensitive issue is that, in cases of great dilution of property with low participation, great influence can be achieved. We have therefore defended the obligation to notify any significant participation and we support the idea of the Member States being able to set a transparency threshold of less than 10% for receiving information and determining its existence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like all my colleagues before me, I too would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Klinz. All in all, we can be satisfied with the outcome of this directive. It supports a valuable aim: facilitating consolidation of the financial sector in Europe. Without fluid financial markets, other forms of market integration will fail. The financial world must show the way; it cannot be prevented from making decisions about investments and mergers by arbitrary restrictions, as has been the case until now.</p>
      <p sl="en">From now on, the rules for national authorities will have to be transparent and strictly prudential in nature, and I am hopeful that they will stick to the letter of what has been agreed. No more pseudo-prudential protectionism, please! The decision by the competent authority on approval or rejection of the action should be as swift and as expedient as possible. Just as has now been agreed in the directive, we are in favour of very tight deadlines for decisions. Furthermore, actions which target investment gains first and foremost, and which do not alter ownership structures, need not arouse the kind of national fears we are seeing in the market. Consolidation in the financial sector should, as far as possible, be about market incentives and conditions, not political considerations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the aggregation of holdings, let us also remain faithful to what has been agreed. If the decisions on holdings are made by independent investment entities, there is no need to aggregate holdings inside one group of companies. We have conglomerates in this market and we need to guarantee that independent actors can act freely. This also concerns the hedge funds mentioned by my colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much welcome this debate and the progress that is going to be made following the ECJ judgments, and I know that the Commission has this in its sights.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I was in Potsdam in January for the German Presidency’s first health conference, I very much welcomed the German Government’s encouragement and its determination to see progress on the issue of patient mobility. We now look forward to the Commission taking that ship into the seas and bringing it safely to harbour for the benefit of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Potsdam, I quoted Jean Giraudoux, because we have a problem, and his quotation, I thought, symbolised it. He said ‘</p>
      <p sl="en">Jamais poète n'a interprété la nature aussi librement qu'un juriste la réalité’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, no poet ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth. And, with apologies to any lawyers who may be listening, it is a fact that the lawyers of Europe are deciding policy on patient mobility. Why? Because the politicians of Europe have failed to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you are happy with unelected lawyers deciding national and European Union health policy, then you do not need to do anything. Just wait and the bills will come in. But if, like me, you believe that it should be the job of parliamentarians, then we need to get on and give legal certainty and guidance without further delay in this whole area for patients.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we need not panic. We are not talking about vast numbers. Most of our citizens prefer local options and, of course, language may be a deterrent to travelling very far. Only if we have waited too long are most of us interested in cross-border healthcare. Our preference is that local provision will improve and make patient mobility unnecessary and that, in a way, would be a good outcome of the ECJ judgments in itself. But we want to know how the new system will work in practice in case we need it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not talking about a pan-European health service. We are talking about new powers for the patient to bypass sluggish and inadequate services locally and nationally. But, without clarity, without systems, without guidance, we are going to see major concerns as patients and their medical advisers seek to find their way through the complexities of the system, and health budget holders are in chaos as they try to cope with totally unpredictable demand for service funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as patients, as doctors, as managers, we need answers to some basic questions. The questions the patient asks are: Do I qualify? What is undue delay? Are there differences between conditions and between individuals, including the age of the individual? How do I apply if I need to? How do I or my GP decide what my options are? What country, what hospital, what specialist? What aftercare? Can I top up if the price is higher than in my home Member State? Who decides if the type of treatment complies with the new criteria? And I need to know before I go, not find out later. And how do I appeal if I disagree with the decision? Or do I have to go to court each time? Who will have access to checks on professionals? How will patient records be exchanged? Who pays for my travel, and for that of an accompanying person if I am a child? What channel for complaints is there if something goes wrong? How will reimbursement be affected? What will be the international interface between different systems, Beveridge/Bismarck, euro/non-euro zones? Do we need a central clearing house for claims and payments, nationally or for Europe? And lastly, is my mental illness also covered?</p>
      <p sl="en">We shall need European legislation for some of these answers and national legislation for others. But above all we shall need guidance to provide clarity for patient and practitioner alike. We shall need to test the water and adapt to experience, such as with centres of excellence. We need to speed ahead with our frameworks for health professionals and patient safety and sort out the E121 system for people retiring abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have voted with their challenges to the courts and the ECJ has responded and confirmed their rights. Now we need political action to put in place a system which will be welcomed by people as a benefit coming from Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not sure whether I can say that we have come a long way since we first discussed this issue, but I can certainly say that we are on the right track. You will remember that our first discussion on this issue was even before the final outcome of the Services Directive. Parliament requested that a proposal on healthcare and health services should be brought forward and I promised that, as soon as the Services Directive was sorted out, I would do so. That is what I did last September in bringing forward this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many issues have been described already and I will try not to repeat them. However, we tried to maintain, firstly, the special character of health, healthcare and health services in the European Union and to meet the challenge not only of achieving the social objectives, but also of benefiting from the internal market. It is true that the Court set out the parameters and the rights in its judgment, but I believe that those rights should be seen not as a problem, but as an opportunity and I tend to agree with that part of the motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have the realities before us, as described by the European Court of Justice. The point now is how to make them work for the benefit of patients, the Member States, national health systems and providers. We can do this not only for patient mobility, but also for all other aspects of cross-border healthcare.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that the ultimate target must be that a European citizen should be able to receive the best healthcare where he or she lives. We should meet our aim of ensuring equality of health in the European Union. However, we know that this is a long-term objective and also that, under certain circumstances, it may not be possible, feasible or even desirable, depending on the financial, as well as – most importantly – the scientific aspects. Sometimes, we will still need to make use of the cross-border possibilities of healthcare.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said, we launched the initiative in September 2006. The idea was to have a broad consultation, which ended on 31 January 2007. In the communication we described and analysed all the problems and issues, which are complicated. We have to follow a step-by-step approach. We will need a package to sort out and deal with all the aspects of cross-border healthcare, but that does not mean that we have to wait until they are all resolved before we present a proposal: we can do that in phases.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now in the process of analysing the contributions. We have had more than 270 from the Member States, from regional and local authorities, and from European national and regional organisations, representing patients, healthcare providers, health professionals, social security institutions, health insurance, universities, and hospitals, and even from individual citizens. Although I do not want to prejudice the results of the in-depth analysis, it must be said that the first assessment confirms the need for Community action to address the range of issues set out in the consultation paper, for example, legal certainty and support for cooperation between health systems. In addition, even though there are many different views on the details of specific aspects, the overall picture is clear: there seems to be potential added value for patients, professionals and health systems overall from some form of Community action on health services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is in the process of analysing a summary of the report on all the contributions already published on our website. A summary report of the contributions will be drafted to provide an idea of the views and ideas sent in and should be available this spring.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the views and the input of the European Parliament are extremely important to us and will be a determining factor.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will ensure that any future proposals on health services under this initiative are consistent with ongoing work on services of general interest and, of course, on the ongoing modernisation of the regulations on the coordination of social security systems. There has to be coherence and coordination among all these initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of the consultation and its outcome, the Commission plans to bring forward practical proposals later in 2007. Our aim is to find a solution which provides real added value without creating more red tape and which respects the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we remember all of the debates that we had in our Parliament, during the debate on the Services Directive, to exclude health services. We felt that health was not a service like any other and that it was absolutely crucial to talk about it in a different way and, above all, not to regard health services merely as being an internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Through its policies, the European Union is encouraging people to move around, and that inevitably has consequences for healthcare. It obviously has consequences for health professionals, who have demands in relation to legal certainty, and, of course, for patients, who are anxious to receive quality care. Hence there are a number of problems, as my colleague, Mr Bowis, has pointed out: language problems, the problem of monitoring care, the problem of the accountability of health professionals and of the quality of care. I think it important to say that patient mobility must not under any circumstances lead to the dumping of health systems, or make health care less secure. That is absolutely crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nor must the mobility of patients and health professionals create two categories of patient: those who can access other types of health care on the other side of the border and those who cannot. It would therefore be interesting to further develop harmonised health indicators at European level. The same goes for the completion of more exhaustive studies, which would enable us to better understand local needs and to do more to target those members of the public who are likely to seek treatment in another Member State, so that we can provide the most suitable legislative solution. To do that, we need a mechanism for gathering data and for exchanging information among national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we need to keep a close eye on the current excesses with regard to self-diagnosis and self-medication via the Internet, which knows no bounds. It is vital that we concern ourselves with patient information and have a genuine European label so that patients using the Internet can be provided with a viable form of security and information. Commissioner, rest assured that you will have our full support and trust for the proposal that you will submit to us shortly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, you know from our discussion in committee that this issue is extremely important for myself and for the PSE Group. We see health services as one of the pillars of the European social model, and the underlying values of that model – universality, access to good quality care, equity and solidarity, to ensure that services are provided on the basis of need and not the ability to pay — are fundamental to us and to that model. We feel that any initiative you take on cross-border healthcare should be built on these principles. It should be about healthcare for all and not about market opportunity for some providers. I think many other colleagues from different groups have already said this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Bowis talked about the legal certainty that is needed in a range of areas. These are the questions that people write and ask me about. They have heard about their rights, they are not sure how they can exercise them, so yes, we want a clear legal framework for patient mobility and for the movement of professionals, not just to give them rights, but so that citizens know that those healthcare professionals are properly qualified, are fit to practise and that information is shared between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Commissioner, you said that you recognised that healthcare has a special character. The health ministers agreed a set of values and principles in June last year, and I wonder whether you will be taking that on board when you draw up your proposals later this year?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we strongly support the Commission’s consultation efforts and the European Parliament resolution outlining the main priorities for public health in the future Community framework. But we should think and plan more broadly: the final goal of future legislation should be better health for European citizens, not only when they cross the border, because by then it might be too late.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to the resolution, I would like to call for your support on the following: basic standards for healthcare should be agreed in order to guarantee patients’ safety and the quality of healthcare; the introduction of a common classification of health services, without interfering with Member States’ competences on organisation, will create transparency for both patients and the financial institutions; and the ‘one-stop shop’ approach to be introduced in the Member States’ health administrations will facilitate patients’ choice and the right to complain.</p>
      <p sl="de">The last issue I wish to emphasise is crucial for the full functioning of any new legislative framework on patients’ rights: a common charter on patients’ rights should be included in the future Community framework. Patients should be able to exercise their rights in the European Union regardless of the ownership of medical facilities, national social security schemes, organisational management of the national health systems or whether medical treatment is provided in the home country or in another Member State. All this is needed for a new European regulatory healthcare framework that would contribute to improving access to the best quality healthcare and to ensuring the safety and rights of all public and private patients in Europe, with particular consideration given to ethnic minorities – for example the Roma population – as well as refugees, migrants and the homeless.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, the fact that thought is being given to cross-border patient mobility is, in itself, a good thing, but patient mobility, however, is entirely different from the mobility of commercial health services. These terms are too often mixed up.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Discussion of patient mobility should not in any event lead to the national healthcare systems being undermined or to Member States passing the buck in an attempt to make their own health care systems reliable, whether in terms of quality or quantity. Nor should it lead to the liberalisation of the healthcare market or force patients out of their own countries to seek care.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Patient mobility is a patient right and should certainly not become the excuse for applying the Services Directive to healthcare services. This House has taken a clear stand against this and would be robbed of its credibility if it were now to take a different line.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as I have only been allocated one minute’s speaking time on the subject of cross-border healthcare, I shall be brief. I simply wanted to point out that, although this brings real benefits to a specific group of patients who are in a position to choose treatment in different Union countries, there are also unfortunately very negative consequences for certain healthcare systems, as well as for many patients from the poorer Member States. These patients’ access to health services is restricted because of doctors’ migration or for financial reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the wealthy old Member States of the Union, the priority is to improve the development, competitiveness and security of their own healthcare systems, which are described as European. The aforementioned countries take no account of the resulting costs to be borne by other far poorer countries. One cannot fail to notice in particular that the rich are becoming richer and safer, whilst the poor are becoming ever poorer. In addition, all this is being described in terms of sustainable development, equal rights and opportunities or as part of the principle of subsidiarity. The latter has had a regrettable consequence for European citizens, namely that the lot of the rich and strong is improving at the expense of the poor and weak.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I regret to say that I regard the Commission’s communication on healthcare services as unsatisfactory. The Commission has failed to come up with adequate and specific proposals for coordinating healthcare provision, since such service provision falls under the purview of national authorities. Furthermore, the communication unequivocally defends the notion that healthcare services should be regulated by the principle of free movement of goods.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this regard I would like to emphasise that patients are not goods and healthcare professionals are not the same as other service providers. The European Parliament subscribed to that principle some time ago, as it excluded healthcare provision from the Services Directive. Despite the fact that cross-border health services only account for about 1% of healthcare provision, the Commission’s communication focuses on patient mobility, cost refunds, etc. One should realise, however, that patients are not small-time traders and that patients do not seek healthcare abroad in order to generate savings but because such care is not available at home. It is therefore, quite unacceptable that Article 95, which regulates the free movement of goods, should be the sole legal basis of the future directive.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission should focus on other pressing problems in the European Union. For instance, on why the mortality rate due to colon cancer is 40% higher in Slovakia than in Sweden or on how the EU could contribute to improving healthcare quality, for example through the use of structural fund allocations more efficiently for healthcare purposes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I only wish patients could join forces with health professionals to bring about change as effectively as farmers can. Perhaps then we would see benefits going not only to farmers and cattle but also to human beings – in other words patients.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission also draws our attention to recipient countries. In this respect I would like to highlight the countries of departure. In Eastern Europe we are beginning to see so-called white holes, or areas where there is a shortage of healthcare professionals.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I want firstly to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for having put this excellent question to the Commission and providing the opportunity to hear the Commission’s reaction to important questions put to it. It also gives those of us in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection the chance to put forward what we think is important. Health is an area in which the Member States have competence and in which the principle of subsidiarity applies. That does not, however, mean that people should not be entitled to health care and medical treatment in other Member States. We cannot maintain that we defend the patient’s right to safe, high-quality care if we do not allow those who need, for one reason or another, to seek health care in another Member State actually to do so. We must do our utmost to preserve these rights, in spite of the various problems of which all Members are so well aware – problems, yes, but also positive aspects, especially on the information side.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also obvious – or, in any case, it should be – that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice cannot be weakened by secondary legislation. There is such a thing as established practice, and the Treaty gives everyone who wants to do so the right to make services available in another Member State, in full accordance, mind you, with the laws of that Member State. As I see it, the Commission should withdraw all legislation in which the Member States and the governments try to limit existing primary law for patients or service providers. It is important that the proposal produced by the Commission should be a step forward, rather than backward, and we have high hopes of Commissioner Kyprianou in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health knows no frontiers, or at least, one hopes that that is the case. In exactly the same way health services should not stop at borders either, in other words, they should be of high quality and available to every citizen of the EU wherever he or she may be. We are now at the beginning of a debate rather than the end of one, so a vigorous debate is desirable and will get us where we want to go; health is not a commodity, and the internal market is, after all, no more than the space within which these services are provided.</p>
      <p sl="de">These services need to be subject to special rules, with questions relating to the guarantee of quality provided, patients’ safety, the safety of medicines and of medical products, to redress in the event of faulty or failed procedures, and to centres of excellence being examined in depth. The patient, who is to be protected, is the subject of particular concern, being, in cases of doubt, the weaker party, and often, indeed, the one who is at the mercy of others.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are, as matter of principle, in favour of patient mobility and of the mobility of service providers, but reimbursement, which is a quite essential element in the cross-border trade in medical services, is subsidiary, and this has to be made plain right now, even though things are only at an early stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not, at present, see any chance of a European health insurance fund, and do not indeed think one is germane to our purpose, on the grounds that all the 27 national systems have their own problems, and, here too, where reimbursement is concerned, we are talking not about an open market, but rather about state-run and dirigiste systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my own country, which has an extraordinarily complex system of payment to beneficiaries, such an opening-up would raise at once the discrimination against the country’s own nationals, since the benefits paid are capped rather than open-ended.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate, which will be very useful and will provide guidance for us in the next steps of drafting a proposal, along with the outcome of contributions from the other stakeholders, from consultations and from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to cover a few issues: first of all, we will certainly be taking into account the health objectives and social values adopted by the health ministers last June, and this will be one of the considerations in our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we will also be looking at the important issue of patients’ rights, which is part of our consultation on Community action. It is clear that we will look at these issues; what tools will be used will, of course, be decided after proper analysis of the consultation and based on the responses provided.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to confirm that what we plan to do is to take a step forward and not to reduce or undermine patients’ rights as recognised by the Court, but to improve them and make them work, make them more concrete, and to make it possible to apply them equally among all European citizens. Information is an important factor in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have already stated, we will take subsidiarity into account. However, I have to remind you first of all that we do not propose harmonisation of national health assistance – this is not the intention. But, at the same time, I have to remind you of the European Court of Justice judgment on the Watts case, which provided that there are situations where Member States, based on other Treaty provisions, will have to apply to amend and adjust their national healthcare systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think there is a misunderstanding here. First of all, there are no proposals in the communication because it is precisely a consultation document. We did not want to pre-empt the positions of Parliament, the Member States and the stakeholders, so it is intentional that there is no proposal at this stage. It is just a description of the problems. Freedom of movement and patient mobility is not something which is being introduced by the European Commission – I think we discussed that in the past as well – it is something which has been recognised, whether we like it or not – and I hope we like it! – by the European Court of Justice, which has established that the internal market rules apply also to health, even if this is publicly funded.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is not a question of a Commission initiative introducing a new concept but how we in the Commission, together with Parliament and the Member States, can make this concept, this reality, work for the benefit of patients without being to the detriment of the national healthcare systems, their viability and their operation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a big challenge for us but I think it is a big opportunity as well, and we can make it work for the benefit of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thank you for allowing this debate to be organised on the ‘One share, one vote’ oral question. On 26 September 2006, a joint press communiqué from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI) informed us that they had won the contract to compile a study on the ‘one share, one vote’ principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a point which our Parliament, during a previous parliamentary term, debated at length, not least at the time of the report on takeover bids. At the end of that long, well-argued and transparent debate, it was decided that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States would be allowed a certain amount of freedom regarding the ‘one share, one vote’ strategies, so as to define the way in which these strategies would work. The importance of management and of the other players as parties to corporate governance, whether they be employees, creditors, customers or suppliers, was also greatly emphasised on that occasion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, as far back as October 2005, Mr McCreevy was confirming his determination to undermine the balance that had been reached at the time of the debate on the Directive on takeover bids, even before the workings of that directive had been evaluated and, what is more, even before that directive had been completely transposed into the Member States’ domestic law. At the same time, when considering the issue of shareholders’ status within companies and of seeing which shareholder strategy would be most conducive to an industrial strategy and to the development of Europe’s strengths as a business location, we see day after day that it would be beneficial, at times, to open a debate on the issue of building loyalty among one branch of shareholders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we are aware of the importance that the current Commission, under Mr Barroso, attaches to impact studies, especially when it comes to defining the right strategy to be followed. At the time when this debate was launched, I said, ‘tell me whom you propose to have carry out the impact study, and I will tell you what their conclusions will be’. It seems to me that, in this instance, it is very likely that I will be able to predict those conclusions, insofar as those who have won the contract to carry out the study on the ‘one share, one vote’ principle are well known for having on many occasions advocated this very principle. We are therefore obliged to ask some questions, and that is the subject of the debate that we are going to initiate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why fund a study to the tune of EUR 450 000 when we already know what its outcome will be? What is the advantage of giving lobbies the means to fund their arguments, which are glorified by the results of a study backed by the European Commission?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I very much doubt that the joint contractors selected to carry out the study will really meet the general criteria of independence and objectivity that are required. It is also important to point out in this regard that, at the same time, in the United States, ISS’s activities are coming under more intense scrutiny from the financial markets supervisor, the SEC, and from the New York Stock Exchange, suspecting, as they do, a high risk of conflict of interest. Like the SECSI and the New York Stock Exchange, we should be alert to the disproportionate accumulation of information and influence by some large players in the chain of intermediaries and advisors involved in the exercise of shareholders’ voting rights in companies, and not react impulsively by giving added weight to those very shareholders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us remember that, when our Parliament had the opportunity in July to give its verdict on the recent developments in, and prospects for, company law, it requested an objective analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence regarding the effects of the different ownership models in the Member States on economic efficiency, owner-control of businesses and the possibilities for cross-border transactions. At the time, however, we also requested a sound analysis of corporate law as regards the wider economic and legal context in the Member States and the different models of corporate governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not have the impression that what the Commission has started by endorsing the proposal for a study by these two institutes provides us with the conditions for a debate that is equal to the challenge represented by the ‘one share, one vote’ issue. I hope, Mr Kyprianou, that you will be able to convey the concerns of this House to the Commissioner responsible, Mr McCreevy, and that, once the conclusions of the study are on the table, these concerns will be firmly established in people’s minds so that we can hold a responsible and effective debate on this issue.</p>

    <intervention id="1-194" speaker_id="2224" name="Klaus-Heiner Lehne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">deputy author. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mrs Berès has just said, for the subject matter of both oral questions is, in principle, quite similar.</p>
      <p sl="de">The reason why the Takeovers Directive is the way it is is that the ‘one share – one vote’ principle does not exist in Europe, and that has to be spelled out plainly. Another reason why it is the way it is is that, back when the Takeovers Directive was being hammered out, it was not possible to secure the acceptance of the ‘one share, one vote’ principle. I was prepared to accept it at the time, but neither here in this House nor in the Council could the necessary majorities be found to support it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that those who speak in public debate read too much into the report that the Commission has now put forward on the implementation of the Takeovers Directive, for the report, in fact, says nothing more or less than that the directive has, by and large, been properly implemented by the Member States, which have availed themselves of the option provided by it, which is precisely the intention behind the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Things will get interesting, though, only when the Commission does as the Takeovers Directive itself requires and, in 2011/2012, produces its first report on the use to which the Directive is put, for then we will have reached the point at which we will be able to arrive at conclusions as to whether what we have done with it – that is to say, setting a benchmark and leaving things to market forces – has or has not been successful, or whether it will then be necessary to consider further legislation, but that point will be reached only in 2011 or 2012, when we have the first definite report on the application of the directive; it has not been reached now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I might add that we – by which I mean this House and the Council as legislator – laid down, by a large majority, certain things on a wide variety of issues currently under discussion, including, back then, the Takeovers Directive, insisting, for example, that the so-called ‘break-through rule’ – which is, of course, the decisive benchmark – should apply to all pre-bid and post-bid defences, although there would, of course, be certain exceptions to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We did not include those aspects that present no obstacles to takeovers, and we did this on the basis of simple accounting examples and the results of simple mathematical procedures, one of these being the so-called preference shares, which were exempted from the ‘breakthrough rule’ from the very outset. Why was this so? One reason why was that the owners of preference shares are paid more than are others; a second was that company law limits them to a maximum of 50% of capital, so that they can never, in fact, tie down more of the capital than can the actual ordinary shares, which carry with them an entitlement to vote.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was for similar reasons that we, at that time, exempted French shares with double voting rights from the breakthrough rule, one reason for this being that these were not voting shares of a particular class, that might be said to be guaranteed in the long term, but rather intended to reward long-term investment, with these voting rights being converted, after a certain period of time, into normal voting rights; the second being that, with the breakthrough rule, the reaching of 75% – which is, as a rule, the quorum at which the breakthrough can kick in – no longer raises the issue as to whether the shares are double-vote or ordinary. If I hold them, I always have a majority in the general meeting. That is the reason why we made an exception for these voting rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">We did, however, include multiple voting rights and limitations on voting rights in the breakthrough rule, since these are real obstacles to takeovers. Here, too, one finds the peculiar situation that there is a disparity between ownership on the one hand and control – that is to say, majority by number of votes – on the other, and we took the view that the application of the breakthrough rule to these would be justified in so far as companies or Member States avail themselves of this option.</p>
      <p sl="de">I just want to reiterate something to which Mrs Berès has referred, namely that we, in the Szejna report, forcefully put forward the view that market forces should, in the first instance, be allowed free rein, so that we could see how this directive proved itself in practice, and that we would decide whether further steps were needed when the Commission, in 2011/2012, had brought out the first report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having now heard that the Commission is mulling over the idea of producing a recommendation on this subject, let me be quite frank in saying that I am less than enthusiastic about this, and that for two reasons, the first of which is that we, in this House, take an increasing sceptical view of recourse to this sort of ‘soft law’. Moreover, the Commission is also running the risk of this House adopting such a recommendation in the form of an own-initiative report, into which it would put something quite different to what the Commission, in its recommendation, has envisaged, and if that happens, the recommendation will be rendered worthless, for a recommendation is effective only if it can be taken as read that the legislator will be prepared, in subsequent proceedings, to support such a regulation, but if the legislator says ‘no’ to it, the recommendation is of no value.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second reason is that I am not wholly clear in my own mind as to what such a recommendation would be meant to accomplish. In Article 10 of the Takeovers Directive, we laid down comprehensive rules on transparency according to which all enterprises have to set out openly all the existing obstacles to a takeover. Those transparency rules are stringent, and I wonder just what the recommendation is meant to achieve over and above that.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is yet another reason for this question, and the wording of the Committee on Legal Affairs’ question alludes to it. We are of course interested to know what view the Commission takes of the development ushered in by the Advocate-General’s summing up in the Volkswagen case, when he, for the first time, had to deal, not with traditional golden shares, but with restrictions on voting and other rules, and he saw these as being contrary to the Treaty in much the same way as golden shares are. Do we actually need to legislate if the ECJ follows this ruling? Does it not mean that all obstacles fall away of themselves? It would be interesting to hear the Commission’s view of this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their questions. My colleague, Mr McCreevy, regrets that he cannot be here this evening, but I can assure you that he will be informed of the results and content of the debate this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that a study was launched in September, and its intention is to cover the various aspects of proportionality between capital and control, how this is applied or not applied in the Member States, how it affects the deviation from the principle and how it affects institutional investors. The study was also designed to analyse the relevant regulatory national frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The contractors were chosen in the usual simple way. There was a public invitation to tender and the choice was simple. The best author was chosen and the specific contractors made and presented the best offer. However, I have to clarify two things: there will not be an impact study, so research will be carried out in a factual way on the current situation in the Member States, and no proposals or recommendations will be brought forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the contractors and the subcontractors have a strong record of original, independent, high-quality research in areas of company law and corporate governance, and their European presence constitutes a significant advantage in terms of providing comparative analysis covering different legal traditions. The subcontractors are of high standing and specialise in corporate law and securities regulation, and the study team provided the best offer based on scientific competence, professional reputation and integrity.</p>
      <p sl="en">As already mentioned, the study will cover multiple voting rights, non-voting preferential shares, company pyramids and other instruments which fulfil the same function of protecting controlling shareholders, and the study will include golden shares and the attribution of special rights for public authorities, as already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, the Commission has noted at this stage the Advocate-General’s opinion on the Volkswagen law. The Advocate-General considers this to be as an unjustifiable restriction that infringes EU law. The Commission awaits the Court’s judgment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the directive on takeover bids is concerned, we know it aims at eliminating certain defences applied by companies in takeover situations. One such defence for companies is to leverage voting rights vis-à-vis capital, but experience shows that, faced with potential takeovers, the vast majority of Member States are reluctant to neutralise their companies’ disproportionate voting rights. Nevertheless, it is still early days for the implementation of a directive. The Commission does not intend to reopen a debate on the takeover directive at this stage. Whatever the policy indications the Commission draws from the proportionality study are, they will not apply to takeover bids. The Commission believes that these two should be considered as two separate initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to emphasise that a decision on any future steps on the issue under discussion on the proportionality issue will be taken in the light of the outcome of the study. Whether we present a proposal, and what the content of this proposal will be, will depend on the outcome of the study and of the impact assessment that is currently being carried out in parallel. We are therefore still at the study and first procedural phase. We will, as always, take very seriously the position and the views of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we must thank Mr Kyprianou for being with us until so late, although the discussion would probably have been much more interesting if Commissioner McCreevy had been with us, since we hold a constant dialogue with him on this kind of issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that this discussion has hardly begun. Parliament and the Council adopted the directive on concentrations of capital. We have recently adopted a directive on the rights of shareholders, and it is clear that fundamental problems are emerging with regard to the structure of companies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The democratic principle of ‘one vote, one share’ is not currently functioning throughout the European Union and, as Mrs Berès pointed out, we are now facing the possibility of great market manipulations by means of certain operators.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that impact studies can be useful, but impact studies are only useful if they are carried out properly. This Parliament’s concern is that wolves should be put in charge of the sheep, so to speak. In other words, if impact studies are carried out by big companies that specialise in market manipulation, then those companies’ recommendations are naturally going to move in the direction of greater market manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Mr Lehne has pointed out, the Court of Justice’s virtual decision on the Volkswagen affair is going to have an impact on the future development of European Union law, but this Parliament does not want the Commission to take the recommendation route, the so-called European Union 'soft law' route, under any circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="es">A more appropriate route is legislation, although it may not yet be the time to legislate, bearing in mind that we have not yet had an assessment of what is happening in the field of concentrations of capital.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is currently a kind of great revolution going on in Europe in relation to concentrations of capital, with great political involvement and great uncertainty in cross-border operations, given the co-existence, for example, of public protection systems and private systems. This issue is of very great significance politically speaking, but it also has certain legal aspects.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that it is important that we point out, firstly, that Parliament does not take a positive view of what is known as ‘soft law’, which requires legislative status, that Parliament welcomes impact studies, but that they must be carried out objectively and not be left in the hands of sectors that may carry them out in a way that benefits themselves, and that there may not be any need to rush into any kind of legislative measure without having studied the situation first.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, however, as I said before, that we are at a time of great change throughout the European Union’s system, and the consolidation of a European law in the field of concentrations and shareholders’ rights requires much more study and above all much more cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that Mr Kyprianou will communicate to Mr McCreevy our interest in this issue, our concern and our desire for Parliament and the Commission to carry on discussing it as we should do.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the principle of ‘one share equals one vote’ is a very attractive one in what is termed ‘shareholder democracy’, and Commissioner McCreevy – who is responsible for these things – fears that any deviation from it might diminish transparency and curtail the shareholders’ rights, but modifications do not necessarily have to be damaging in their effects, for they can bring with them more competition and innovation, while at the same time taking account of the different types of shareholders, who have differing interests and behave in different ways.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission is now planning to publish, in the autumn, a recommendation on the principle of proportionality between capital and control, which will be based on the results of an extensive study. Mr Lehne has already referred to the problematic aspects of this recommendation, and Mrs Berès has – I think rightly – surmised that a survey entrusted to ISS, the European Corporate Government Institute, and Sherman &amp; Sterling might well not be as objective as the matter in hand might require, and so I appeal to the Commission to delay its practical proposals until after extensive and objective consideration of how things stand in Europe and after a critical and all-embracing assessment of our experience with the Takeovers Directive. What is important in this is that consideration be given to the advantages and disadvantages of all systems deviating from the ‘one share, one vote’ norm, whether pyramid structures in Italy, preferential shares in Germany, double voting in France or the ‘A’ and ‘B’ shares found in the Nordic countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to carefully distinguish between, and balance against each other, the desire to make the shareholder’s control proportionate to the shares he owns and the company’s desire for contractual freedom, between stable shareholding structures on the one hand and sufficient discretion on the other, with it being guaranteed in each instance that any deviation from the ‘one share – one vote’ standard will be transparent, and that the shareholders are entitled to know whether or not the shares they own or acquire limit their ability to play a part in determining the business’s direction and their control over the way it is managed.</p>

    <intervention id="1-198" speaker_id="4483" name="Ieke van den Burg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">According to this morning’s Dutch papers, ISS, the company we are talking about, is advising its customers to thwart the plan to pay out an extra loyalty dividend to the shareholders who leave their shares in that company for three years or more at the forthcoming shareholders’ meeting of DSM, a major Dutch multinational. I think this plan by DSM is, in fact, a fantastic idea to promote responsible shareholdership. Extra dividends could be a means to achieve this, but so could higher vote weighting, which could be another legitimate form. This is why I have always opposed those who persistently advocate what they call shareholder democracy on the ‘one share, one vote’ principle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This was broached for the first time when we discussed the Take-Over Directive. The original intention of the thirteenth directive was certainly not to create the kingdom of corporate control by shareholders on earth, but simply to protect minority shareholders and allow for a decent buy-out. A handful of fanatic interested parties, however, managed to make this one share, one vote idea absolute, the key advocate being ISS. Not only based on ideological motives, but also because their trade simply consists in collecting voting rights and granting proxy services to shareholders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With all due respect for the Commission’s statement, I consider it highly unusual that an inquiry should be launched within a party that is so outspokenly prejudiced and implicated. I have just been familiarising myself with the way the inquiry was conducted; I have seen the questionnaires that are still being circulated among investment companies on the one hand and companies on the other, in which companies are simply being asked whether they use certain Control Enhancing Mechanisms (CEMs), including pyramid structures, certification, gold shares, and suchlike, while investors are approached in a totally different way, being presented with a number of leading questions that gauge their views about all these bad measures. I can probably predict the outcome of this inquiry.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In a nutshell, I already have major reservations about the outcome of the inquiry and do not think it can be a sound basis for further conclusions and intentions, such as drafting recommendations. We should first of all look into the reasons why companies have these CEMs and why, in this day and age, in which shareholder activism on the part of hedge funds is rife, there is a renewed need for protection against short-term investment activity. A fundamental debate with this House will be needed before the Commission is ready to develop any measures or any further activity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for the debate. I will be very brief.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like to say to Mr Medina Ortega that I am sorry that I could not stimulate a more interesting debate, since I am not the Commissioner responsible. However, it was very interesting for me because it reminds me of my previous life as a lawyer. I find these issues extremely interesting. Let me assure you first of all that I will of course brief and inform my colleague. However, I understand that you will all have the opportunity to discuss these issues further with the Commissioner responsible because he will be attending both the ECON and JURI committees sometime in March and all these issues will be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to repeat that what the Commission does will depend on the study and the impact assessment. With regard to the study, the choice of contractors was made on the basis of our rules and regulations, taking into account the requirement of the European Community. Again, I would like to remind you that it is a factual study that will not put forward recommendations. This will be done by the Commission itself. So, I am sure that the outcome will be a balanced and proportional view, depending of course on the results of the study.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have listened carefully to the Commissioner’s reply. Nevertheless, the message that needs to be conveyed to Mr McCreevy is as follows: we certainly cannot tell what the Commissioner will make of the results of the study, but our concern stems from the study itself, even before the results are known, given the issues that have been outlined by the authors of this study.</p>
