      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was reviewed in June 2009 in order to extend its scope to cover crisis situations. At that time, cofinancing of the fund was increased from 50% to 65% and the number of redundancies was cut from 1 000 to 500 to facilitate the use of that instrument. These provisions and this extension, in a way, will end on 31 December of this year, when it is clear that, as the Commission President told us in no uncertain terms yesterday, and as everyone pointed out in the debate that followed on the State of the Union, the crisis situations are not over – anything but.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being the case, we believe it is absolutely vital to extend this arrangement as it stands, in other words, to allow the fund to be used if 500 employees are made redundant, either in a labour market area or in a company, and to permit cofinancing. This is the main message that this House wants to send out, particularly to the Council, to which we are making urgent calls to resolve this situation – and I find it somewhat regrettable that it is not present to hear our message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would be rather paradoxical if, in the case of Greece, one of the proposed tools, namely, mobilisation of the Structural Funds to deal with the crisis situations that exist – where we have already adapted the arrangement to that end – were not extended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In our resolution, we offer some guidance on the future reform that the Commission will be proposing to us, and this is the subject of the debate that we are due to have this morning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of this future reform, Parliament is proposing, for example, that restructuring situations and situations involving multinationals, which may be able to take advantage of this arrangement to compensate for their relocation strategies, should be examined. However, we also offer guidance and, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as you know, I can tell you that we examine each mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are aware of just how valuable this tool is in terms of bringing to life a concept that lies at the heart of the EU strategy, of the EU 2020 strategy; of bringing social innovation to life so that, when a situation associated with the effects of globalisation and of the crisis comes to be examined, a social dialogue is launched, and so that everyone’s situation is examined according to his or her ability to enter a phase of transition or training, in order to be able to start a new job or find work again in the future. From the point of view of European legislation, it is a truly exemplary tool. Of course there are things that will probably have to be re-examined, refined and corrected, but now is not the time for that. We will have that debate when we discuss the financial perspective and the new proposals to be tabled by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The priority today is not to stop this arrangement on 31 December this year but to allow it to be extended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that this House will see fit to support us. Then we will have the debate both on the conditions under which this fund may be applied to multinationals as well as on the conditions for making it permanent in budgetary terms, to verify exactly where these resources should be entered to enable this action to be financed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank Mrs Berès, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for taking over without amendments the Commission proposal to extend from 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2013 the crisis-related derogations set out in the regulation on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the current worsening of prospects for the economy, I think the only acceptable message that you can send people and, in particular, the workers, is that the EU will continue showing solidarity and offering support to workers who lose their jobs as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis. In these times of alarming budget deficits and public debt, keeping the cofinancing rate for actions supported by the fund at 65%, rather than reverting to the pre-crisis rate of 50%, will also bring some relief to Member States’ budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since it was set up in 2007, the fund has helped nearly 76 000 redundant workers in 19 Member States to find new jobs. It has provided cofinancing amounting to EUR 358 million for active labour market measures to cover such actions as job-search assistance, training and entrepreneurship promotion. Over the last two years, two-thirds of that amount was granted, or has been applied for, following redundancies that stemmed directly from the economic crisis. I can therefore say that the fund has been, and still is, a key component of the EU response to the employment impact of the crisis. I sincerely hope that the Polish Presidency will succeed in winning the Council’s approval for our proposal to extend the crisis derogation to the end of 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Evidence from the national authorities and the workers who have benefited shows that the Member States have provided assistance of a better quality to a large number of workers and for a longer duration than they would have done without the fund’s help.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, let me briefly touch on the fund’s place in the future. It is a flexible fund that falls outside the financial framework. The amounts that are needed vary from year to year. That is why the Commission is proposing in the multiannual financial framework a package to keep the Globalisation Adjustment Fund outside the financial framework with a maximum of EUR 3 billion over the next programming period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EU will continue to assist the Member States in providing tailor-made support for workers made redundant as a consequence of increasing globalisation. The Commission is also proposing that its scope be extended to providing transitory support to farmers in order to facilitate their adaptation to a new market situation resulting from the indirect effect of globalisation. The Commission is also contemplating support for start-ups and entrepreneurship promotion in the form of investments in capital. We are considering possibilities to use this tool up to a maximum of EUR 35 000.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s debate is timely as we are in the final phase of the preparation of our proposal. I look forward to the discussion and to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Ms Berès, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question in my mind that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is an important instrument of proven merit. Parliament has always played a vital role in mobilising this instrument to help those in the European Union who are victims of the phenomenon of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On a personal note, while we are discussing this matter, I should like to applaud the truly outstanding role played by my colleague, Barbara Matera, in the individual mobilisations of the fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are glad that it is being maintained, just as we are glad that it is functioning better and becoming more effective. Ideally, we will be able to mobilise it more quickly, but the problems associated with rapid mobilisation are, incidentally, often problems inherent in the Member States rather than problems in the design of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also need to concentrate more closely on the contribution the fund makes to innovation and to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Above all, Commissioner, in future, we need to prevent, as far as possible, the abuses we are seeing in certain individual instances of mobilisation, where it really does seem as though some multinational companies are not victims of globalisation at all. Companies that do very well out of globalisation are using these additional funds to be able to relocate throughout the world, and are receiving EU support to lay off their employees to boot.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Commissioner, I fully share the view – as does my group – that the fund must remain a flexible instrument that is kept separate from the financial perspective and the official EU budget. Flexibility is one of the main assets of this fund, and it must be maintained.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, on this subject of a fund to help workers who have been made redundant, we obviously cannot welcome the fact that it is needed or the fact that it is a growing success. However, these are facts that we must acknowledge and which require an effective and permanent response mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased, therefore, with the Commission’s proposal to make the fund a permanent fixture in the future EU financial perspective, as we requested in the report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Resources for a Sustainable European Union after 2013, and to extend the criterion for awarding funds on account of the crisis until 2013, as we requested in the Committee on Budgets’ report on the future of the fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we must not stop there because, since the adoption of these reports during the mobilisation procedures, we have observed the need for other changes that are mentioned in the motion for a resolution and which should be included in a forthcoming review of the fund’s operation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must highlight three in particular. In order to prevent the mobilisation procedures from being too lengthy, as at present, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) must have enough appropriations so that unused funds do not have to be transferred from other programmes. We need to involve both sides of industry and the authorities, and finally, the EGF must form a coherent part of a comprehensive European policy on restructuring.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I fully support the derogation to 2013 whereby the numbers would decrease from 1 000 to 500. It is very clear, if you look at the applications coming in from Member States, that more and more Member States are using this basis, Article 2b. If we look even at the applications in 2009 and 2010, we can see that this is the situation and I, like Madam Berès, will call on the Council to support this. I believe Parliament will fully support this today and the Council should be here today to listen to the strong views of the Parliament on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2010, 10% of all redundant workers accessed funding under the EGF. As far as I am concerned, that is a direct connection between redundant workers and the EU institutions, and workers understand that the EU institutions are responding and putting in place a personalised package of services for them. If you read the Commission reports, you will see that workers benefit from accessing the funds in many different ways. Central to that, of course, are measures that improve their employability opportunities but there are other benefits, too, and I agree with you, Commissioner; it is an expression of solidarity, but the good thing is that that solidarity is very closely linked to the EU 2020 objectives. So we have a win-win situation where we have a connection to citizens that helps to ensure the EU 2020 objectives are achieved. I believe that we do need to continue with this derogation, where 500 workers can access the fund, because, if we do not, then we are saying to citizens: we are not responding to your in times of austerity. I believe the Council needs to listen to what Parliament is saying on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group will not support the proposal regarding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). The EGF is a redistribution tool, the essence of which is that we take money from the successful, spend some of it, and allocate the rest to failures, in accordance with our rules. Success and failure are natural in the market and, as politicians, we are understandably tempted to give money to people. However, we often forget that we take this money from others. Therefore, instead of the successful ones developing their businesses, they are handing over some of their money to failures. This is not about solidarity between the strong and the weak or disadvantaged; experience shows that the beneficiaries are mostly very powerful market players. From the very beginning of the fund, there have been doubts as to where these resources are being directed. Instead of globalisation, the fund often addresses transfers between Member States, and supports planned restructuring instead of the consequences of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my fellow Members are right: the redundant workers are bearing the brunt of the crisis. That is why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have so far voted in favour of all the applications from the Member States. The EU funds measures that are intended to prevent long-term unemployment. In our opinion, however, applications in which these measures do not form part of a social dialogue should not be approved in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the Verts/ALE Group are also critical of the fact that this financial instrument is being used to support workers so that they accept employment contracts that are below their previous pay level. This especially applies to older workers. Although they may feel that a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush, as far as I am concerned, that is not in the spirit of a social Europe – because at the end of the day, they are worse off and receive lower wages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, there are repeated cases in which companies’ redundancy programmes are practically adopted by the EU, particularly in the traditional automotive industry. It is this industry that is profiting most from this indirect EU assistance. In our view, this instrument should be organised differently. It should not be used to plug financial gaps, but should instead be used strategically to work towards sustainability. It should invest in green jobs and in the transition to a green economy if it is to be a genuinely long-term investment.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also do not believe that this fire-fighting intervention by the European Union is really of any benefit for investing EU funds for the long term. In our view, it is a fire-fighting measure for competition losers, including in terms of the transformation into a green economy. That is why we need much greater intervention by the European Social Fund towards future-oriented further education and training, so that redundancies do not take place in the first place and our economy can be reshaped along ecological lines, making us global competition winners as a result.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015-000" speaker_id="28406" name="Miguel Portas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, there are two discussions taking place here that are completely unrelated. The first is whether or not this fund, in the context of the ongoing economic and financial crisis and the likelihood of a new global recession, should be extended to the end of 2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My answer is: yes, it should be. It should be extended because, although it does not actually avert the evils of global capitalism or of the economic and financial crisis, it at least has the virtue of supporting those who are the worst affected – the victims of mass redundancies. Moreover, this is not an insignificant matter in a Europe that focuses much more on capital than it does on work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is precisely because this is a redistribution fund that it is so important. It is because it provides an opportunity for those who have far fewer opportunities. However, our Conservative colleague, by contrast, believes that we are supporting those who have not been successful. Well, it is precisely the fact that we are supporting those who have not been successful and giving them a new opportunity that justifies this fund’s existence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nonetheless, it is true that it needs to be changed. It needs to be reformed. In view of this, I should like to support the resolution adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because it reaffirms each of the points that were adopted by Parliament a year ago and raises another extremely important point: the financing for this fund needs to be aligned with the cofinancing rate for the Structural Funds. This has not been achieved, however. This fund cannot offer more support for those from rich countries who are made redundant than for those from countries that are suffering more under policies of recession and austerity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was invented to persuade Member States to adopt Lisbon without national referendums, but this expensive project has insufficient checks. In Antwerp, General Motors claimed EUR 9.5 million from the EGAF. Their redundant workers received EUR 150 000 each and then some found work with Volvo nearby. Of the five countries with negative growth, three have put in no claims, while stronger economies have, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria leading the way, and several more this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many firms are closing due to trade moving to the Far East. Glasfiber in Denmark closed because their manufacturer of wind turbines moved to China. This does not happen just because Chinese workers are on low pay; indeed, on Tuesday in this House, the Commissioner discounted that. More to the point, what he said was that China’s central bank sets its own interest rates, while the exchange rates make Chinese products more attractive on world markets. EU manufacturers will struggle on world markets if euro membership makes their products too expensive – ask Greece!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are two problems with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: firstly, that it provides the European Union with a responsibility that Member States could much more appropriately fulfil themselves; and secondly, that it recognises that globalisation wreaks havoc with peoples’ livelihoods, but the EU does nothing to address the cause of the problem – which is globalisation itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Globalisation moves manufacturing from high labour-cost countries to low labour-cost countries, and floods the West with goods from those countries, destroying our manufacturing bases and taking the jobs of our workers. It would be very difficult to compete with low-wage economies without reducing our wage rates to the levels in those countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We might hope to use technology in an attempt to compete, but our technology is often exported to countries that compete with us, or is bought and copied – infringing the western manufacturers’ patent rights. The countries of Europe must individually or collectively – I would prefer individually – protect their industries and peoples from ruin and impoverishment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some 23 million people in Europe are unemployed today, and more than 113 million people are living under the threat of poverty and exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having worked as the permanent rapporteur on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for Parliament’s Committee on Budgets for over two years now, I have been closely involved in the operation of one of the EU’s newest and most effective instruments for supporting the labour market. Since its creation in 2006, the EGF has assisted more than 75 million redundant workers in Europe and has alone retrained over 10% of those unemployed in the period 2009-2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">Its success is exemplified by the constant increase in the number of applications for assistance, by the desire to extend the derogation on account of the economic crisis, and by the confirmation that the EGF will feature in the next financial framework. As it is very new, however, the fund has room for improvement, especially where simplifying procedures and speeding up the allocation of funds are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore hope that Parliament and the Commission will work closely together to define as best they can the new sectors, such as the agricultural sector, the public sector and the casual labour sector, that could be eligible for assistance from the fund.</p>
      <p sl="it">My group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), therefore welcomes the resolution by Ms Berès, whom I congratulate, and I hope, especially at the end of the vote, that the vote will be a united and unified one, because the people of Europe need this united and unified Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides money from Europe for the people affected. This support makes the European Union a visible presence in the Member States. People see funds being used to provide financial support to the victims of globalisation and of the economic and financial crisis. In this regard, all the Commission’s proposals for speeding up the procedure deserve our unqualified support. After all, a procedure that takes up to 18 months is a particularly long time for a campaign that is all about fire-fighting – far too long.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention one aspect that is a particular concern of mine, and it concerns the future development of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The Commission, in considering opening up the fund in future to farmers, is missing the point. In so doing, it would be directly taking away money from workers affected by restructurings and by the crisis – that much is crystal clear. It would be a redeployment of funds. I wanted to mention this at this point because the next financial framework will be upon us very soon.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was created to counter the consequences of globalisation and its negative impacts. Perhaps we should point out once more, however, that globalisation is here to stay and it is irreversible. That being the case, it is much smarter to bring about structural changes in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, the fund has also since been used to balance out business relocations within Europe, and now it has been expanded – as a basic exception – to include the crisis situation in which we find ourselves. The proposals contained in the resolution tabled, which we broadly support – and I am looking at it mainly from a budgetary point of view, not from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – move us in a sensible direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">In all seriousness, however, when I see an amendment that is aimed at lowering the Member States’ cofinancing rate to 5%, I have to ask myself whether there will remain any incentive whatsoever for the Member States to bring about adjustments in their own labour markets if they can benefit from this. The same applies to the call for companies to create jobs. I do not believe in all seriousness that anyone assumes that companies are merrily making workers redundant so that they can then get money from the fund to employ them again. We are not Europe’s employment agency where this is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one last point that I feel I must address once again. The multiannual financial framework sets out that in future, funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund can and should also be used for the agricultural sector. This leads me to ask: if the agricultural sector can be one of the largest budget lines in Chapter 1, is there anything that could not be there? Moreover, this should not form part of the regular budget. I believe we need further discussions on this as part of the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, crisis is an opportunity for evaluation and effective change, not an excuse to plough forward perpetuating more of the same. I do not support this resolution. I do not think the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is effective. Why? It does not go to those Member States most in need. We have already heard that Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands accounted for over 30% of applications, and they have good growth. In 2010, many countries with no growth made no applications – including Greece. Why?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it targets the wrong people. Those newly redundant are not those most in need; they are usually skilled and experienced and they are advantaged in the job market. We should be helping the young. This is where resources should go. This fund is entirely badly focused. Rather than act now, we should wait for a full evaluation of the fund. I hope we change our emphasis to the long-term unemployed and youth. We must also include this fund in the next financial perspective; it must not be allowed to continue as a de facto off-balance-sheet item.</p>

      <p sl="fr">More fundamentally, however, I should like Europe not simply to put money into dealing with the social effects of globalisation but to establish mechanisms to prevent redundancies and relocations, with the introduction of financial penalties for large multinational companies that lay people off purely to increase their profits, as true agents of capitalist globalisation as we know it.</p>

The EU is falling behind on the global economic stage. We are hearing today what the EU’s response to this problem is: it is redistribution. It is State aid. Ladies and gentlemen, I need to draw attention to the fact that it was State aid and redistribution that led the EU out into the mire and to the collapse that it is experiencing today. Nevertheless, the only answer that the bureaucrats in Brussels and in Strasbourg and also the vast majority in the European Parliament, who enjoy spending other people’s money, can give is more of the same. More of what led the EU on the wrong path. This will not resolve the problem; it will make the problem worse.</p>

It directly supports workers who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation. Solidarity? Yes, of course. In its current form, however, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has obvious shortcomings. It absolves companies of their social obligations and responsibilities. In the everyday implementation of the fund, it has emerged that companies are including it in their calculations as a social add-on, because the funding is paid for solely by European taxpayers. We need to make the fund more socially balanced and fairer to European taxpayers. The companies therefore must be made to contribute to the payments made by the fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I should like to add one thing. If we were now also to make payments in the agricultural sector, then the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would really be living up to its aim and its purpose.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I agree with those who, above all, emphasise the symbolic significance of this fund. It is indeed a good system for the European Union to show its citizens that it understands people, and the problems of people, who are faced with unexpectedly great difficulties with a shock-like suddenness.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let us recall that we originally created this fund – which we also called a delocalisation fund during the debates when the current scheme was being elaborated – with the aim of showing, in the event of sudden, massive, simultaneous instances of unemployment resulting from decisions taken due to commercial globalisation, that the EU is ready to lend assistance if necessary when rapid response is beyond the capabilities of a national service. However, I would warn everyone against seeing this fund as a correction for globalisation and the crisis. These resources are insufficient for that and, besides, this would neither be appropriate nor justified. Employment and social policies generally fall within national competence, so the fund is much more of a supplementary nature, but as such, it is extremely useful.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As for ourselves, we, too, support the idea that the fund be extended, but we do not support that the scheme change as a separate line of the budget. We do not consider it appropriate to give the impression that the EU is taking over the competences of individual Member States. As for the need to make modifications within the Structural Funds and to better coordinate the Structural Funds and the Globalisation Fund, it is an interesting idea and should be given thought. We suggest that the Commission consider this, prepare some form of analysis, and then we can come back to it if and when appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is being extended until 2014. I am absolutely certain that all of those who have lost their jobs on account of the global crisis have been glad of the contribution that this fund has made. It is never nice to lose your job, and if it does happen, it is important to get started with some targeted training or retraining as quickly as possible so as to increase your chances of finding a new job. In this regard, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has helped a lot of people, and that is good. Unfortunately, the handling time is far too long, and work ought to be done to reduce it. The average handling time is almost 300 days, and then it is another couple of months before the money is paid out. This means that it actually takes almost a year. It also means that the time in which the money can be spent is actually reduced to a year. This needs to be looked at more closely. Improvements can be made here.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, for a politician, it is very difficult to be against a fund such as this globalisation fund because, let us be honest, it helps people who need it, who are in a difficult position. That does not, however, release us from our duty to examine critically whether this is the right way to spend public money. I have my doubts about that. I do not think that it is up to Europe to apply sticking plasters throughout the European Union. It is up to Europe to do much more to strengthen the European economy structurally. This is why I do not support this fund.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I do support – and this is the course we really should follow – is making the European budget much more flexible within the new multiannual financial framework. That is what is ultimately at issue. Then we, as Europe, will be able to react to crises in the world and not continuously set up one fund after another which we then find difficult to abolish.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not support the European Commission’s proposal. It appears that the Member States worst affected by the crisis have not drawn on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Whilst the Member States with unemployment rates well above the EU average during the crisis have basically failed to submit any applications, countries that had no significant problems in their labour markets have benefited greatly from this fund. We should also bear in mind that interest in drawing on this fund has decreased significantly. Whilst 23 applications were discussed last year, this year, only seven had been received by the summer break. This suggests that the financial crisis has subsided, and that the current economic difficulties are no longer a consequence of the initial crisis of 2008 and 2009, but are instead a consequence of the debt crisis, which the EGF is not focused on solving. We should also concede that the EGF is associated with a high degree of bureaucracy. If we really want to carry on tackling problems of this type through European resources, which I am personally not in favour of, we should make use of the European Social Fund.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, how often have the people of Europe been promised that they will be led out of difficult social situations, out of poverty and exclusion. Since 2006, there has been concrete assistance – the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which supports people made redundant in their search for a new job. Originally, it intervened if at least 1 000 employees of a company and its supply chain were made redundant, for a maximum period of 12 months. Due to enduring economic problems, the criteria were expanded in 2009. The fund now steps in if 500 workers are affected, the term of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund projects has been extended to 24 months – rightly so – and the maximum rate of cofinancing has been increased from 50% to 65%, all effective until the end of this year. Since the labour markets in many Member States have not yet recovered, we want to extend the period until the end of 2013 – not for fire-fighting purposes, but for the sake of sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund only provides support for the workers, not for the companies – as is a common misinterpretation. Workers are assisted with reintegration into the labour market, through retraining, through further education – I would describe it as a European added value. One thing, however, is not acceptable: the fact that money for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is constantly being taken from the European Social Fund. The European Social Fund is indispensable for securing the livelihood of local job creation companies, for the fight against early school leaving and for the achievement of qualifications. Let us ensure that the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are not played off against one another.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the few years that it has been around, the fund has proven to be a useful and effective instrument. The last few months in particular have confirmed this beyond any shadow of a doubt, if you compare the number of applications that were made between 2007 and 2009 with those that were made between 2009 and 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, it is clear that the nature of the fund has changed somewhat. It was set up to help the workers of companies that were being restructured as a result of globalisation, whereas today, it mainly assists companies that have been hit by the crisis. The crisis is also affecting the workers of small and medium-sized enterprises. We should think about them, too, but this requirement in no way detracts from the value and usefulness of the fund. What we need to do quickly is to review some of the fund’s rules so that its funding is more consistent and, above all, so that it can be accessed much more quickly than is the case today. That is what we must do.</p>

It has actually been functioning at the expense of those taxpayers who, despite the economic and financial crisis, survived within fierce global competition.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has proved itself as an instrument for supporting workers, the victims of mass redundancies, who need help in retraining and finding alternative employment. This is confirmed by data showing an increase in the number of applications from people to whom that help has been directly given and the size of the funds committed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The enlargement of the scope of applying this fund to include those people who have lost work as a result of the economic crisis has been a step in the right direction. This has meant that alongside measures taken at national level to combat the crisis, the fund has become an effective instrument which supplements the efforts of Member States intended to counteract the deteriorating situation in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is these two arguments, that is, the rising interest in obtaining support from this fund evidenced by the growing number of applications and the perception of the fund as an effective tool in combating the effects of the crisis, which are the strongest arguments for extending the crisis-related derogations until December 2013.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, amongst the criticisms made by those who receive support from this fund is that the European Commission takes too long to review applications. This results in delays to the usefulness of measures which are taken, and sometimes reduces their effectiveness. Therefore, consideration should be given to introducing changes in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one of the social policy success stories for Europe which leverages individualised retraining for unemployed men and women of all ages and all skill sets. At this time of crisis, when the Commission and the Council are taking what I consider to be lopsided steps to address the debt crisis, giving rise to growing EU criticism, this successful fund needs to be continued.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first fund allocation for Ireland, for instance, for the Dell workers in Limerick, has not only retrained the workers but has also succeeded in creating 240 new jobs. However, some of the money has remained unspent because of the inflexibility in the expenditure deadlines and because the clock starts ticking from the date of application, rather than the date of approval. I believe this should change.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would make the point that this is not intended to be a total response to the crisis, nor is it intended to be a total response to unemployment. Of course we need to address youth unemployment specifically, but one does not cancel out the other.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, if we were to ask ourselves the question ‘is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund useful?’, the only reply can be ‘yes’. However, what if we take this notion one step further and ask ‘is it useful enough, is it used enough, is it adapted enough to the current needs of the economy?’ …</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the statistics, with assistance being provided to 40% of those made redundant, more than one-third of workers given assistance between 2009 and 2010 successfully found employment. This means that four in every hundred workers made redundant successfully found employment. This is not enough, especially if we consider that the current crisis is far from being over.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why we need the measures which have been proposed: extending the exemption allowing the fund to be used to support redundant workers until the end of 2013 and extending the fund’s activity even after the current multiannual financial framework has expired, not to mention introducing quicker intervention procedures, identifying the reasons why some Member States have never used the fund (which is a worrying aspect), and then resolving the problems identified.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The solutions we need are greater efficiency, less red tape, easier access to information, the exchange of good practices between Member States and including more people in the activities supported by the fund.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is about to celebrate its fifth birthday and every child’s character is apparent by five years old. The fund’s basic character is also apparent. However, we can still intervene and make improvements. One improvement which I think should be made is to encourage our ‘baby’ Globalisation Fund to walk faster and to serve the purpose for which it was established more quickly. That is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also maintain that the operation of the fund, which was originally planned to end on 31 December 2011, should be extended to 2013. I believe that the fund is a very important mechanism, especially in times of crisis. As I have heard my colleagues expressing an interest in Greece, I have here an article – one of many – which says that the Commission intends to propose that Greece be granted aid of EUR 2.9 million to support persons made redundant by the company Aldi.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I wish to ask a question to which, I fear, an answer cannot be given in this Chamber. Where is the Council? Does it not consider this debate important?

      <p sl="pt">My country, Portugal, is an example of a country which has benefited from this fund; it has applied to it four times for assistance. We are aware, however, that access to the fund could be improved, especially in the countries worst affected by the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, having evaluated the current economic situation in the labour market, who would even question the need to extend the application of exceptional provisions until 2013. The answer is unambiguous – it is essential. However, we really should also assess the fund’s current operational procedures, which are too bureaucratic. The length of time involved – a year, sometimes even more – is unsatisfactory, and therefore, as stated in our resolution, it really should not take longer than six months for a country to receive the necessary assistance. Secondly, we really should examine thoroughly and assess whether Member States applying for such assistance should have the opportunity to receive an early payment, i.e. an advance, within a slightly shorter period, so that they can help those made redundant tangibly and swiftly. Indeed, I agree with and will stand alongside those colleagues who have said that it is also necessary to involve social partners in this work. Commissioner, perhaps you could explain why those countries in which there is a high rate of unemployment are not applying for assistance from the EGF? Perhaps this might help them?</p>

      <p sl="ro">However, the Commission should consider maintaining a high rate of cofinancing so that Member States with budget austerity programmes, like Romania, can also have access. With an unemployment rate of more than 7%, but below the European Union average, Romania must adopt an effective professional retraining strategy.

I think the experience gained from implementing the EGF is extremely valuable – the negative as well as the positive aspects of that experience, because both either were or still are in evidence.

      <p sl="de">I believe that this is absolutely the wrong time to be starting a debate based on envy. This redistribution policy should be seen as a very important task of European policy. It is of great importance that we establish once and for all that redistributed money is not money that has been lost or given away, but that instead redistributed money contributes to people who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation – I am talking, for example, about people in the haulage sector, delivery people; more than 3 000 have been made redundant in Austria – now hopefully being able to draw on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">This money creates value. This money creates purchasing power. This money allows those enterprises that have paid the money into this fund as taxpayers to have customers again. In other words, I would really urge that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be seen as an economic motor and not simply as something that is distributed in Europe as a kind of giving of alms.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in this debate, there are three issues that need to be clarified concerning the existence of this fund. First, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has emerged as a merely palliative measure in a time of worsening employment, as a result of EU structural policies that jeopardise Europe’s industry and make life easier for multinationals, which do not accept any social responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the EGF uses funding criteria that are deeply unfair and lead to situations like the ones we have already experienced in this week’s plenary session, in which, for a similar number of workers, we have approved about EUR 4.4 million in EGF aid to Germany, almost EUR 3.8 million to Denmark and only EUR 1.4 million to Portugal, despite the fact that Portugal is in the worst state.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The last issue is the high cofinancing rate required of the Member States, which is 35% of the total amount provided. In order to mitigate this situation, we hope our proposal for reducing the cofinancing rate required of Member States to only 5% is approved, especially for countries that are in a fragile state financially, like Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is a genuine belief that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund has a role to play in the future as a rapid crisis intervention instrument for showing solidarity with the most vulnerable workers in society. To add value, the fund’s support should encourage measures to correct skill mismatches in difficult labour market situations. Special attention will need to be paid to the social responsibility of large companies, particularly as regards collective dismissals. Many of you raised this issue during the debate, and the Commission will, of course, take your contributions into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you raised some doubts about the inclusion of farmers in the future Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The Commission considers that farmers are also exposed to the risks of globalisation, particularly where forthcoming trade agreements are concerned. We consider that there is a strong necessity to include farmers in the scope of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. In the proposal on the multiannual financial framework, you can see that we proposed a limit of up to EUR 2.5 billion to be used for farmers, also trying to ensure that at least part of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to workers in other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the Member States and the European institutions involved in the decision-making process should do their utmost to speed up delivery of support from the fund. On this point, we also have some ideas on which we are currently finalising our work. For example, we are considering the introduction of electronic application forms and the standardisation of questions in order to reduce the time needed to apply for funding. We are also looking at other initiatives which could streamline the process. We fully agree that we have to streamline the process and to make the procedures much faster.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Ms Berès for her report once again. It will provide a valuable contribution to the Commission’s work on the future of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to thank all of my fellow Members who have spoken during this debate, because I believe they have helped to shed light on the discussion. The Council is not here, but I hope that it will hear the powerful message that this European Parliament is about to send. We are calling for a decision to be reached quickly in the Council and for the arrangement permitting the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in connection with the crisis to be extended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, we have listened to you and we recognise that you are sensitive to the deep concerns that have been expressed throughout this debate on the subject of the strategies of multinationals, which should feature in the Commission’s work programme and on which we hope to receive some proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moving on, a number of groups have been mentioned. Should we focus on young people in particular? My colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, said that we should not neglect the situation of workers just because we are focusing on young people. Similarly, you mention the situation of farmers, who may be eligible to use the fund in the future. Fair enough but, once again, let us not create a situation in which we have the poor showing solidarity with the poor, or the victims of the crisis showing solidarity with the victims of trade agreements. If we go down that road, everyone will have to shoulder his or her responsibilities, and the resources allocated to the fund will have to be adapted accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I want to reiterate the fact that we in Parliament believe that the ability to use this fund based on the administrative arrangements that exist in each of the Member States and based on the quality of social dialogue is absolutely crucial. Many of my fellow Members have wondered why there have been no applications to mobilise the fund in such and such a country. Well, I believe that if Europe wants to be a vehicle for improving the Member States’ administrative capacity, then mobilisation of the fund is a very good test; once again, it is a good tool and one that Europe needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If, tomorrow, the Council were to decide against extending this fund, and against allowing it to be mobilised in connection with the crisis, then it would bear a heavy responsibility, because it would be sending the message that, just when the crisis is having an even greater impact than before, Europe is cutting the means of support that it provides to its workers. That would be to pave the way for Euroscepticism. We call on the Council to listen to this Parliament’s message.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The closure of Waterford Crystal in Waterford, Ireland was a hard blow for hundreds of workers and households. It is estimated that personal spend has reduced by EUR 40 million annually in Waterford City and in the surrounding area as a result. The EU’s decision to allocate money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the region some years ago was welcomed after the hard blow of the closing of Waterford Crystal. I am still receiving questions and complaints from former employees in relation to the problems they have accessing basic information about the fund, information in relation to access to training and education, and in relation to receiving funding from the fund to pay for those training courses. Even though the administration of the fund comes under the authority of the Member States, I think that a review should take place into the management of the fund at national level. Has the Commission done a review into the effectiveness of the fund in terms of the employees? I praise the aims and the objectives of the fund, but to achieve those good objectives, the fund must be implemented effectively and transparently and there must be direct relations with the former employees. Without that, there would only be another cause of distress to them.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EGF was designed as a tool for rapid intervention in the event of mass redundancies, with a view to preventing long-term unemployment in difficult labour market conditions; whereas the original aim of the EGF as an instrument was to alleviate, within a short timeframe, acute and unforeseen labour market problems caused by the dismissal of a large number of workers either from big companies or from SMEs operating in a particular sector and in a particular region. The long-term Europe 2020 objectives aimed at increasing employment and employability rates are supported by the European Social Fund.

      <p sl="pl">The adoption of a resolution on the commissioning of a special budgetary line for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for combating the effects of the economic crisis is a very good step taken by the European Parliament, not only for Poland, which has already used its funds on three occasions, but also for the remaining EU Member States which would like to make recourse to it. Thanks to the EGF, support was given to 10% of the workers who were made redundant in the EU during 2009-2010, of which 40% have successfully found other jobs. Extending the operation of the fund until December 2013 will be an effective instrument which will make it easier for workers who have been made redundant to go through the often long and difficult process of requalifying and vocational training in situations of unpredictable sector and enterprise restructuring, particularly as a result of the crisis or the effects of globalisation. I also hope that the European Commission will administer the procedure of approving applications efficiently, since the speed at which procedures are completed is a factor which makes citizens feel that these measures are successful. This is especially important, as the number of people who need this help is very high, as is confirmed by data showing an increasing number of applicants who have received help from the EGF and the size of the funds involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the many Members who have signed this oral question.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU’s objectives in terms of the fight against climate change have resulted in the implementation of what are very demanding EU policies and measures for European industry. The target of reducing CO2 emissions is, at present, a unilateral commitment that is exposing a large proportion of Europe’s industrial system and, in particular, its energy-intensive industries to a high risk of carbon leakage.</p>
      <p sl="it">The emission reduction targets, while worthy in their aims, should be pursued in a realistic and practical way. We are calling on the Commission to adjust the tools for applying the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the financial compensation measures envisaged as carefully and as accurately as possible, in order to prevent any imbalances in the EU internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Under Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended in 2009, thermal power companies will be obliged, from 2013, to purchase allowances for all of their CO2 emissions, which means that the increased costs will be passed on in electricity prices and hence, that production costs will rise significantly.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to Eurostat data, the ETS will cost European industry an estimated EUR 8.5 billion more each year in increased electricity prices. Indirect emissions, as opposed to direct emissions, do not benefit from a compensation system to prevent differences in treatment between industries in the same sector that have different production processes and which face obvious distortions of competition within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">If an equivalent compensation system is not established for indirect emissions, there is a very great risk that companies will relocate. Choosing sectors exposed to carbon leakage on the basis of the NACE code classification system is simplistic and restrictive, since it does not allow for the specific type of energy-intensive production to be identified, with the result that compensation cannot be granted to subsectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the case of steel production, there are two production processes: the electric furnace and the full cycle, which uses fossil fuels and a small amount of electricity; it will receive almost all of the free allocation of allowances for direct emissions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The electric furnace process, on the other hand, will receive only 30% of the free allowances due to the lack of a compensation system for the electricity portion, even though it emits a fifth of the CO2 produced by the full cycle. Therefore, because of the type of production process used, the same product will see its price increase in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fears of such a market imbalance have been voiced by many parties, by many industrial sectors, as can be seen from the responses to the public consultation launched by the Directorate General for Competition. How does the Commission intend to proceed with regard to State aid for energy-intensive industries, in order to ensure the continuation of European industry and to guarantee jobs and prosperity? Could the revenues from the sale of allowances not be used to offset the imbalances that will be created from 2013? Are we certain that the sale of allowances will not lead to speculation? How does the Commission intend to rectify competitive disadvantages?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission is aware of the importance of electricity costs for the production of steel, and of the influence that European climate change measures can have on electricity costs. The Commission is also mindful of the present difficult economic situation and of the importance of sustaining the economic recovery with smart measures, taking into account the move towards less polluting as well as less risky sources of energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission aims to maintain a viable energy-intensive industry in the EU that can compete worldwide on its merits. State aid can help in this context, if it helps to structurally improve the competitiveness of the industry in a sustainable way, but it cannot serve to guarantee lower electricity costs for certain users in the long term. We therefore focus our efforts on measures that have the potential to structurally improve the situation of industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the ETS Directive, which was part of the 2008 climate change package, Member States may grant compensation for CO2 costs of electricity for companies at risk of carbon leakage due to these costs – aid for indirect emission costs – in accordance with State aid rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Financial compensation for indirect emissions can create major distortions in the internal market and may undermine the price signals created by the EU ETS if it is not properly targeted to sectors that are at real risk of carbon leakage due to indirect CO2 costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its statement submitted to the Council during the climate change package negotiations, the Commission established the guiding principles for granting financial support for indirect emission costs. According to these principles, financial compensation should be limited to those electricity-intensive sectors which are unable to pass on the electricity cost increase stemming from CO2 to their customers through product prices without significant loss of market share, and would thus move to less carbon-efficient installations outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In defining the rules for compensation for ‘indirect’ carbon leakage, the Commission will have to pay careful consideration to the effective need and justification for aid in view of the need to preserve the internal market, avoid ‘subsidy races’ between Member States at a time of tight budget constraints, and ensure equitable conditions for competition between firms in the same sectors.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed comments. However, these detailed statements do not answer the questions that were put. The point of the questions was to ask whether it has been ensured that results will be achieved quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The industries that we want to exclude from these additional burdens, or in which we want to bring about fair conditions, need planning certainty. That is why we need decisions to be made soon. We need rapid decisions that can be relied on and we also need clear statements from the Commission. This process has already been extremely drawn out. We were all aware that it is a highly complex process that we have embarked upon, but when we accepted the compromise on the Emissions Trading Directive, we said that a condition of our acceptance was that relief would be provided for those European industries that were excessively burdened as a result, because otherwise they would not be able to compete with other areas of the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">I expect the basis upon which we acted at the time, the grounds for the decision in Parliament, with the Council and the Commission, to be realised as intended. I am slightly worried that, along the way, the group of industries concerned is getting smaller and smaller, that – if I may say so – our perspective is getting meaner and meaner, that more and more areas are being excluded. We are not just talking about steel; the aluminium industry is also affected – you know that – along with many other areas, such as chemicals and so on, and we are talking about the fact that what was the political basis for the decision at the time is not being implemented in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you rightly pointed out, Commissioner, the situation of industries in Europe has not got any easier since this decision; rather, it has got more difficult. We are in a completely new situation and competition is much fiercer. We all struggling with it and giving fine speeches here about how these industries are very important for the future development of Europe. There were more smart speeches given here yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="de">I expect – Parliament expects – that what was agreed then will now be implemented, for the benefit of the industries – no, not the industries, but rather the people who work in these enterprises, for jobs and thus for Europe’s future opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, industry is vital for jobs and development in Europe. Without a competitive industry, the service sector will not grow either. Against this background, it is clear that the Commission must be very strict, observant and active when there is competition or a risk of competition that is based on lower climate and environmental objectives that result in carbon leakage.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Of course, we must also stand up for the principle of making exceptions for sectors that are indeed exposed to carbon leakage, and apply the principle wisely. However, this must not be taken to mean that European industry should be able to avoid its responsibility for climate policy in general.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the one hand, the Commission must keep an eye on carbon leakage, leakage of jobs and leakage of competitiveness, and take action. On the other hand, faced with the lobbyists who sometimes tend to exaggerate the leakage risk, the Commission must respond to the demands from these lobbyists with substantiated facts and sometimes also with a certain mistrust.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thus, it is the Commission’s job to deal with both of these challenges and not to set them against each other.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we all acknowledge the need to set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we can combat climate change, and we are proud that the European Union is the global leader in this important battle. At the same time, I believe that we need to adopt a pragmatic approach and examine closely the impact of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Stopping the free allocation of allowances to electricity producers will naturally have repercussions for the price of energy, which will have an impact on the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, such as the steel industry. Member States and the sector are obviously affected in different ways, depending on the method used to produce electricity and the type of furnace, powered either by fuel or electricity, as also mentioned by Mr Pirillo. In my country, Romania, for example, half of the total amount of steel is produced in electric furnaces, which means that there will be a far-reaching impact. I firmly believe that similar situations are encountered in other Member States as well. I would like to stress that the steel market is a global market and that the emission reduction targets are likely to distort competition between producers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At a time when a global agreement has not been reached on emission reduction targets, European Union industry is subject to pressure to which companies in countries that have not set such ambitious targets are not subject. This is why the risk of leakage is very real and must be tackled as such. To eliminate this risk, the Commission should clearly stipulate in future State aid guidelines that all the industries on the list adopted by the decision of 24 December 2009 are eligible to receive compensation for the costs incurred by indirect emissions. These compensatory measures also have to be proportionate to the level of indirect costs generated by the Emissions Trading System.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Failing this principle, only a partial solution is provided to the problem, which will pose a threat to the industry’s competitiveness and, therefore, to several thousand jobs in the European Union, and will mean failure in terms of the global reduction in carbon emissions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in relation to the climate policy of the European Union, and only because of this, energy-intensive industry is under huge competitive pressure from countries outside of Europe, where discipline regarding CO2 emissions just does not exist.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of the chemical, paper, cement and steel industries, this means reducing investment in Europe, it means reducing innovations in these areas, and it also means moving jobs outside of Europe. In many European Union Member States, these industries pay disproportionate amounts for electricity just because the energy sector is dominated by high-emission technology, as is the case in Poland. This interferes with competition in the EU market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we do not wish to lose competitiveness, we must provide energy-intensive industries with tax relief and public aid and we must suspend transmission fees, so that it will not be too difficult for these industries to make the transition to a low-emission economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have denounced the risk, both in the Commission and in Parliament, of Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances being turned into instruments of financial speculation forcing many companies to relocate to third countries because they can no longer compete in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Passing on the cost of CO2 emissions in electricity prices will affect the industrial system in various ways, and will penalise more energy-intensive industries such as steel and aluminium manufacturing. Does the Commission believe that compensation should reflect the actual price increase sustained by companies in various Member States and that it should be guaranteed until the risk of relocation has passed?</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, should financial compensation not be guaranteed for energy that is consumed and not just for energy that is bought in from abroad? The bureaucratic procedures enabling companies to take advantage of State aid encourage unfair competition on the part of companies located outside the EU. Does the Commission have any plans to simplify these overly burdensome procedures?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Pirillo for having put this issue on the agenda because, after all, we have no direct powers here; however, we have to push the Commission on this. As Mr Reul pointed out, however, it is not just about electric furnace steel; a whole range of industries is at risk of carbon leakage. By way of example, I would mention the aluminium industry and the chemicals industry, which must also benefit from this aid. I emphasise ‘must’ because it says so in the directive. Our problem is not the Emissions Trading Directive and particularly not the amended directive, for the existing directive – which is effective until 2012 – does not contain this provision. We have now expressly laid down in the new Emissions Trading Directive that enterprises that are at risk of carbon leakage will receive support for direct and indirect emissions. The Commission must therefore implement this. The problem is not the text of the directive – that has actually been improved, because we now have this possibility of compensation which we did not have previously – but rather that the Commission must now get down to work.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need a clear aid framework that is transparent, otherwise there will be hidden subsidies in different Member States and competition will really be distorted. I would like to make it quite clear that some enterprises are urgently awaiting this. They are already making losses or at least are not making a profit, because the certificates – even if they are given out free of charge – have been priced in by the energy companies. If there is no light at the end of the tunnel for these enterprises from 2013 onwards in the form of aid that they will receive, then they may make decisions that can only be bad for Europe as a centre of enterprise.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need differentiation depending on the electricity mix in the Member States. We must not over-compensate, but we must not under-compensate either, and we need to keep pointing out that we do have benchmarks. We are only talking about compensating the best 10% of enterprises. That is sufficient incentive to be efficient and the Commission now needs to implement this.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the steel industry is the foundation on which the European Union was created and one of its key economic pillars. Without the steel industry, it is not possible to maintain future growth and development in a global market which does not have any compulsory common rules. Steel and aluminium production requires large volumes of electricity. Regardless of the short- and medium-term improvements which will be made in the future to cut carbon emissions deriving from electricity production, the price of this energy will obviously rise due to additional costs incurred with emission certificates. I think that the production of steel and aluminium in electric furnaces must be quickly included among the industrial sectors eligible for financial compensatory measures, with the aim of safeguarding the European Union’s industrial competitiveness. This can eliminate the disadvantages in competing with steel and aluminium producers from countries that grant subsidies or do not promote policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions.</p>

      <p sl="it">I should like to point out that the additional costs involved in making the system more efficient will be able to generate investment for financing research and development activities. I believe that this can benefit companies and the sector as a whole, both in terms of increased productivity and in terms of innovation. The significant impact on employment should also be emphasised. We must ensure that discrimination between processes and sectors does not result in companies relocating outside Europe and, therefore, in a loss of companies that make a vital contribution in terms of production, distribution and consumption of resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">The labour market and productivity, characterised by investment in new technologies, are two pillars that are crucial to Europe’s economic and sustainable growth.

I would like to underline that the role of the EU ETC is to induce a positive change in the energy-intensive and emission-intensive industries towards more efficient technology. The ETC does not consider the competitiveness of the industries mentioned, which are caught in the middle between making investments to reduce emissions, thus internalising the debt service at their cost, and using market mechanisms to maintain existing technologies, i.e. internalising the cost of emissions certificates.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to note that the timeline for technological change in these industries is rather long, in contrast to market dynamics. The effects on the competitiveness of these sectors induce the risk of lost production cells and emissions reallocation, leading to job losses and to serious social effects. For example, Romania is highly exposed to carbon leakage as it is located at EU borders. We call on the Commission to take all the necessary measures.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, CO2 policy in the European Union is crystal clear, including the policy for vulnerable sectors. What is at issue is the fact that the costs which the electricity sector is able to pass on to energy-intensive sectors – such as steel, chemicals and aluminium – are a genuine threat to the competitive position of the companies concerned. The problem therefore lies with the passing on of the indirect costs associated with the electricity sector to high users.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we need, Commissioner, is good information, information that covers the whole of Europe, so that you will also be able to apply Article 10 – which we have not introduced for nothing – right across Europe, because we cannot again damage the level playing field for companies in Europe. Quick action is required.</p>

The use of binding commitments will require proper measures in order to implement them and to shift our industry to a green and sustainable path. However, we will also have to carefully consider the possible negative impacts on certain industry sectors which are dependent on higher consumption of electricity and which, without certain compensatory mechanisms, risk losing their competitiveness both inside and outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">China, for example, has the fastest-growing steel sector in the world and the EU has become its biggest export market. I believe that the Commission has to carefully and responsibly address those issues in the upcoming State aid guidelines and to find a sound compromise between the EU’s commitments and the viability and competitiveness of our industry sector, which are inseparable from the overall growth and prosperity of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I am from Galaţi, a city which has both a steel industry and shipbuilding. My county is extremely reliant upon the jobs provided by these industrial sectors and, by extension, on the European framework enabling these industries to be developed. Therefore, the competitiveness of European industry and preserving jobs in the European Union depend on the way in which we are going to manage to modernise our energy-intensive industries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that, during the debates we have on emission certificates for these industries, we should lay down clear conditions so that we oblige and, at the same time, help companies in these sectors to invest in technologies which are cleaner and more efficient in terms of resource consumption. I think that our ability to keep jobs and production in these sectors within the European Union in the long term depends on the measures we take now to modernise and make companies in energy-intensive industries more eco-efficient, including the steel industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would again like to thank Mr Pirillo for his question. The Commission is certainly not washing its hands of this very important subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">The impact assessment on State aid guidelines concerning energy-intensive industries is ongoing. This impact assessment includes the steel industry as well as other industries which could be exposed to this problem. We cannot reach a firm conclusion on the specific sectors that will be the subject of these guidelines until the impact assessment is finished.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the timing is concerned, the Commission’s intention is to have the new guidelines adopted by the end of the year, after a public consultation. Its services, namely the Directorate General for Competition, launched a public consultation via a questionnaire on the controversial issues of sectoral eligibility and calculation of the aid level. We received more than 140 submissions from Member States, industry associations and environmental NGOs. The services are currently analysing the replies, after which the Commission will present draft State aid guidelines. Member States and stakeholders will be consulted another time, before their adoption by the Commission, and, at the same time, Parliament will also be informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you can see, the process is fully transparent. We are working on the guidelines and we will come forward with those guidelines by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, ten years after the events of 9/11, the risk of terrorist attacks remains real and aviation is still a preferred target. Airport security scanners are a valid alternative to existing screening methods because they have good detection performance, in particular to deal with the major risk from non-metallic threat items.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s draft measure does not impose the deployment of security scanners at EU airports, but allows Member States and airports wishing to do so to deploy security scanners at EU airports under strict minimum EU operational safeguards and detection performance conditions. It only allows the use of non X-ray security scanners. Failure to adopt the rules at European level will mean unilateral actions, and very possibly the US standards being imposed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where privacy and data protection are concerned, the use of security scanners raises important issues of privacy and data protection. The Commission fully agrees with Parliament’s objectives in this regard. Our draft measure imposes strict conditions for the use of scanners. These conditions are in line with the advice given by the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and provide all the necessary safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights, privacy and data protection. Passengers must be fully informed about the technology and of the conditions of the security scanning.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hand searches, which are performed today to detect threat items, are perceived by many to be quite intrusive. The Commission’s draft measure aims to offer passengers and staff an alternative, by going through a security scanner. Two types of scanners currently exist. Both systems ensure compliance with security standards and respect fundamental rights. For example, security scanners shall not store, retain, copy, print or retrieve images.</p>
      <p sl="en">One type of scanner, which is currently more common, makes use of a human reviewer to determine where possible threat items are to be found. To protect personal data in the use of such scanners, our proposal stipulates that no image can be seen at the security screening point, but is instead remotely analysed by a security officer located elsewhere. In addition, the image cannot be linked to the screened person and must be blurred or obscured to prevent the identification of the face of the passenger. The human reviewers analysing the image cannot see the screened passenger, nor do they have any access to personal data identifying the person. These safeguards address fundamental rights concerns by protecting the person’s dignity and privacy, and guarantee the protection of personal data. Moreover, these are minimum conditions and Member States can impose stricter ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second type of scanner is able to recognise threats automatically. These machines do not produce a real image, but a stick figure which is marked with possible threat items. The Commission shares the view that automated threat detection is the preferred method. It is therefore committed to working closely with the industry and Member States to make sure that, as soon as possible, only such scanners are used. However, if today’s scanners were limited to models using stick figures, the market would be severely restricted, giving undue advantage to a few manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regardless of the type of scanner used, the draft measure gives passengers the possibility to choose not to go through a scanner. No passenger will be forced to use the scanner, as Parliament requested.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the procedure, while we understand your interest, the Commission does not believe that this draft measure should be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure. Amendments to the methods of screening fall within the scope of the comitology procedure as established in the existing framework regulation on aviation security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me recall that before presenting this draft, an open and transparent consultation process with all parties involved was conducted, including a public consultation and an impact assessment. The Commission exchanged views regularly with Parliament. We waited for Parliament’s resolution on aviation security of last July before finalising this draft. The current draft measures reflect Parliament’s opinion to the greatest extent possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, in a field like aviation security, decisions need to be taken quickly to respond to a security threat. This is in the passengers’ interest. The ordinary legislative procedure would not be appropriate to achieve this objective. The result would be that Member States would take national measures. The role of the European Union in aviation security, and the ability to set common EU standards, would be diminished.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important now to move forward on this file. Parliament, passengers, Member States and the aviation industry have been waiting for a clear position for a long time. A common EU approach to the use of this equipment is the only way to ensure both the highest level of aviation security and the best possible protection of EU citizens’ fundamental rights and health. Common EU rules also overcome the existing fragmented situation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in 2008, Parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it. Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above.</p>
      <p sl="es">True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred.</p>
      <p sl="es">We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation. Commissioner, you said that in this case, this proposal largely meets all Parliament’s demands. In my opinion, that is not the case, and also in my opinion, it is not the case either that all the privacy rights of passengers have been safeguarded. That is why we have just tabled an oral question on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, as Mr de Grandes Pascual stated, we had a report in which we discussed and set out what form scanners should take where these are permitted to be deployed as an additional security measure at airports. In this report, we also said that people must have a free choice as to whether or not they go through them. Health and human dignity must be protected; data and privacy must also be safeguarded.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, what has now been proposed is exactly what we did not want. We did not want to have scanners that show real images – whether or not these are blurred. I am familiar with these images; I have been to the US and have seen such scanners. I do not want something like that placed in Europe’s airports. These scanners do, in fact, allow quite a lot of a person’s body to be seen. To me it makes no difference whether or not the person looking at them is in another room and does not see the people in real life. It is a violation of privacy and intimacy, and we expressly discussed the fact that that is exactly what we do not want.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite this, the Commission’s proposal now states that something along these lines is to be permitted in order to implement our decision. Naturally, we are upset about it. That is why we are asking you to reconsider. There is the option of having simple stick figures, as they are known – in other words, schematic illustrations; either a green OK or a stick figure with red dots – showing, for example, that an arm should be investigated because something suspicious is indicated there. That really is something that we would like, without images being stored. That would protect people’s privacy as well as protecting data.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are astonished, and we are not happy that something different is now being proposed. If the installation of something that is actually quite different is being considered, then we need a legislative process. We are talking about the citizens of Europe and that is why the representatives of these citizens need to be involved in a proper procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Commission for its statement today. It was very interesting.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no disagreement between the Commission and Parliament on the inclusion of body scanners as an additional security measure in the fight against terrorism. However, I still have some concerns about the way we are moving forward. We know that technology is already available which addresses the health, privacy and data protection concerns of screened passengers and would avoid passenger exemptions, yet the implementing measures produced by the Commission have failed to specify that the body image must be in the form of a stick figure, which colleagues have already raised, nor does it specify that backscatter radiation equipment is unacceptable to this Parliament, especially when there are effective alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, Commissioner, we need to raise our game in the areas of cross-border intelligence, counter-terrorism measures, the use of central reservation systems and, not least, passenger profiling in order to identify potential terrorists before they even reach our airports.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential that we find a more sophisticated way forward in the fight against terrorism. To achieve one-stop security, we must have uniform rules applied in a harmonised and coherent manner across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, thank you for your flexibility in allowing me to speak later than expected. I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its statement and for the solid progress made on this matter. You will be aware that, three years ago, Parliament staunchly opposed the introduction of rules relating to the use of body scanners because, at that time, you were actually asking for a carte blanche in order to do what the Member States wanted without going into detail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Much has happened in the meantime. Tests and trials have taken place at a number of airports. The technology has evolved enormously, and discussions have also taken place between the Parliament and your departments. You will be aware that we adopted a resolution a few months ago in which we summed up our conditions. You have taken them almost entirely on board.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important that the introduction of body scanners in airports should not be compulsory. It is to remain optional. It is still possible for people to refuse to be scanned and to opt for an alternative screening method. Account has been taken of our demands concerning public health: scanners with ionising radiation are being prohibited. Strict conditions regarding privacy are also being attached. I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that security personnel are not allowed to make eye contact with a person going through the scanner, that images may not be stored, and that they are blurred. We would have preferred stick figures – that is a small nuance that does make a difference – but overall, we feel that we are able to support these proposals and that we, Parliament, must be consistent. You have taken account of our viewpoint. Let us now move ahead.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I represent the freedoms of passengers, of Europeans. It is thanks to the European Parliament that X-rays have been banned from body scanners and that passengers have a free choice of whether to pass through a body scanner or not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yet we also clearly argued against the use of photographs and against there being security staff, male or female, sitting further up the chain looking at photographs of naked passengers. These arguments were not accepted. Why were they not accepted? The reason is that commercial interests come before private interests, before privacy. It is a little strange to know that the technology exists to use this equipment entirely without photographs but that privacy has been sacrificed because we apparently do not want to price certain companies out of the market. It cannot be right that our privacy and our freedoms should have to give way to companies which apparently are not innovating enough.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would very much like to hear from the European Commission as to why it has chosen to bow to these companies. As I see it, the world has turned upside down. We could still do something about it, but no, the European Commission has decided in all its wisdom that these are merely technical measures and that legislation on this matter is not needed. Body scanners at airports is just the beginning. There are already body scanners at the Supreme Court in Paris. Who can tell us that companies or institutions, such as large museums, will not introduce such equipment in the future? How do we guarantee that citizens, visitors to museums, passengers at airports and train passengers will not be stared at by somebody further down the line? It is not necessary, we should not be doing it, and I would appreciate it if you would respect our wishes in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, body scanners are placebos. If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, body scanners that use X-rays and microwaves enable us to see liquid, non-solid and plastic explosive materials that metal detectors overlook. However, they not only reveal what is hidden beneath a person’s clothes, but their whole body. I believe that body scanners can only be added to the list of authorised screening methods if, and I stress if, an independent body carries out a comprehensive, scientifically based impact assessment. This assessment should take into account immediate and delayed effects and the long-term cumulative impact on human health, as well as risks to personal data, individual dignity and privacy. I propose that we should once again seriously consider alternatives to the use of body scanners. We must use less invasive technologies which are completely reliable and do not infringe fundamental rights or pose a danger to human health. Specific rules should be laid down for especially sensitive or vulnerable passengers, such as pregnant women, children, people with disabilities or with specific illnesses making this type of check unadvisable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a debate that raises many emotive issues to do with human rights and, most importantly, security. One of the points I would make is that when anyone uses airports, they do so of their own free will, they do not have to do so; so they do actually voluntarily give up part of their liberties. It has been said that, to protect us all, some of us have to give up part of our liberties. I do, however, support the view that alternatives – such as searches – should be available.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue has flummoxed this Parliament and the Commission for some time. In 2005, while this Parliament was completely opposed to body scanners, the European Union spent EUR 725 000 on six body scanners that have never been used and are sitting in a car park in Brussels. They are now obsolete, but you pay a yearly maintenance. This is another example of you saying one thing and asking people to do another. This should be a matter for Member States. For Christ’s sake, spend money wisely, do not just throw it away! We have a shortage of money.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this is a debate that has already taken place, but I shall make some comments with reference to new scenarios.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, clearly from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and our group, the S&amp;D, there were many serious civil liberty concerns. The Commission proposal has, in fairness, taken into account much of the Parliament’s position, apart from the point which was our insistence that stick images be used. The Commission proposal does allow for body image technology to be used, but the image is to be blurred and obscured and, of course, the images will be remote. I have seen for myself in UK airports such as Manchester how that remote image technology works.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, when passengers are given the choice to refuse to go through a security scanner, they will be subject to alternative security procedures. These must be proportionate and must also fall within what is deemed to be proportionate measures. The proposal does give us, however, an EU-wide framework; it does set minimum standards. It will also prevent situations such as passengers being told that they cannot fly if they do not go through a security scanner at all, and it will ban the use of X-ray security due to serious health concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the S&amp;D reiterate the request made in July that common rules on the use of security scanners must be revised on a regular basis and, when necessary, adapted to improve the protection of fundamental rights, health, privacy and personal data in line with technological progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am glad to say that, within the ALDE Group, our representatives on the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are united in our dissatisfaction with the Commission’s implementing regulation, unlike in the two biggest groups where I seem to see some sort of discordance between their TRAN and LIBE arms. But we are united. I thoroughly agree with what Ms Meissner has said and agree with some other people, like Ms Foster, for instance, from the ECR Group. It does seem to be a major missed opportunity that the Commission has failed to advance best available technology. It may well be that, at the moment, there is only one supplier of stick images but, as has been said, once the regulations are set, you can be absolutely sure that other suppliers will pile into the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I find the Commission decision frankly incomprehensible on both privacy and, indeed, technological grounds. We can have effective and more sophisticated security scanners that fully meet the privacy concerns, not only of the Parliament but the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Fundamental Rights Agency and so on. You are still going to capture a naked body image. Whatever is said about blurring or the reviewer being distant and so on, that is the fundamental problem and potential assault on both privacy and dignity. You have got the possibility of stick images with no human intervention. Why has the Commission missed this big opportunity to secure both technological advance and privacy?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the Commission for its statement. I want to start by saying that I do not want to be seen as somebody who upsets Liberal unity, but I would remind Ms Ludford that these proposals have actually come from a Liberal Commissioner. Members will be aware of the positions taken by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, both in its decision to agree with the Commission’s recommendations in regard to security scanners, and in the excellent work done by Mr de Grandes Pascual in his much wider report on aviation security.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe there is a need for a harmonised system – that is EU-wide – to put an end to different security measures being taken at Member State level, leading to anomalies that are confusing, inefficient and discriminatory. If you look at both the de Grandes Pascual report and the Commission’s proposal, you will see that 90% of what this Parliament demanded has been incorporated into those Commission proposals. The one outstanding issue is the one relating to the image shown by the machine and this issue, in my opinion, has detracted from the fundamental issue, which is that of aviation security. Yes, Parliament would prefer stick figures; but the question we have to ask is: are we as a Parliament prepared to throw out all the good things that are in that report purely on this issue? In my view, that would be wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members from other committees may feel that individual liberties should take priority over security – and that is their right. But for me, there is no greater civil liberty than for people to fly safely and securely without fear of being blown up, without fear of terrorist attack, which is why I am happy to agree with the Commission’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Simpson, you trot out that old canard that those of us who are concerned about privacy are somehow not interested in security. But what I think many of us in this debate are saying is that it is not necessary to choose between the two. We know that there is available technology – which the Commission has failed to support – that would better ensure privacy, in the shape of stick-figure machines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Do you accept that it is possible to reconcile security and privacy? In your capacity as Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, will you try and advance that, instead of trying to trade off security against privacy and saying that those of us who are perhaps on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs do not care about security? Because, believe me, we do care about security, and we fly as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I am not sure what a canard is, but I will say this: as far as I am concerned, we all share the need for security and we all share the need for civil liberties to be protected. But what we have to get is a balance and what I think we have sometimes is a debate that focuses on the civil liberties issue rather than on the issue of aviation security.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I must admit that I feel rather sad that we are having this debate. This is because it is a perfect example of a parliamentary debate that loses sight of the general picture when it becomes bogged down in technical issues or minor detail.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have just heard Mr Simpson make a point of exceptional demagogy: ‘there is no greater civil liberty than for people to fly safely and securely’. Mr Simpson, there are various civil liberties and it is not just up to the Committee on Transport and Tourism to decide which of these actually matter and are of greater importance than the others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Like the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I also believe that there are concerns about privacy and health issues here, but they are unlikely to be the last word on the question of body scanners because ultimately, even once these privacy issues have been successfully dealt with, there will remain yet another problem: these body scanners are expensive. It is going to be expensive to introduce these body scanners into airports throughout Europe and, despite what Mr Simpson says, that will not overcome people’s security concerns because, in five or six years from now, there will be new security threats and new types of equipment. In addition, there will always be terrorist threats outside planes, and we have the right to feel safe on trains, in shopping centres and in schools as well.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What I am trying to say with this is that there is no cost-benefit analysis in this debate (neither in the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) that will tell us: is it the citizens of Europe who are asking for this? The answer to this is no. The citizens of Europe are asking for jobs, education and health care. They are not asking for millions to be spent on body scanners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is something we are forgetting. We are forgetting all about this cost-benefit analysis and we are forgetting all about this part of the debate concerning the real world. That is why this debate is making me sad.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Ms Ernst, I have not actually been able to find a single example. However, there may be more and better examples of public investment in engineering technology to be found for things that are really necessary, such as, for example, in the case of European civil protection services, the development of equipment for locating people buried beneath rubble following earthquakes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I recall that at the time of the attack in Detroit, which was the attack that began this whole debate about body scanners, we also had an earthquake in Haiti. There were hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble. We did not have the equipment to locate them. Every day, however, lobbyists from the scanner industry were knocking on the doors of Members of the European Parliament to tell us: our scanner meets your concerns about privacy very well, but each one costs EUR 150 000 and we are going to fill every airport in Europe with them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, without doubt, terrorism is still – and will be for a very long time – a threat to in-flight security and, of course, there is no easy way to address it. However, I fail to see the purpose of this unprecedented rush to adopt body scanners when their effectiveness is disputed and, at the same time, the time required for passengers to go through security controls will certainly increase. Moreover, in addition to the high price that will doubtless need to be paid, they do not resolve the problem of how to protect passengers’ dignity and, more importantly, their health.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the health issue, it is encouraging that the Commission has sought the opinion of the special scientific committee on new health risks. This was something that we proposed back in March. However, it is a pity that this opinion only relates to one type of scanner, rather than forming part of a more detailed study into the safety and suitability of scanners.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, on the question of fundamental rights, if the Commission’s decision to give passengers the right to opt out translates into an obligatory body search, as has happened in the United States, then I fear that this provision will prove to be even more problematic than the operation of scanners themselves.</p>

Also, the question of whether scanners are appropriate and effective has not been answered; I consider this to be a crucial issue because, if we are not certain that scanners are sufficiently effective, then why are we embarking on this entire process? I think that this decision to integrate body scanners into airport security systems is extremely premature and extremely rushed. There are still a lot of unanswered questions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the use of body scanners has undoubted benefits and may contribute to greater aviation safety. One of the positive factors is that they detect more than just metal items. This is an advantage at the moment, when potential weapons consist of components made from different materials.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The scanning method must, however, be acceptable in terms of protecting the privacy of the travelling public. Only schematic views should be available, and any data obtained in this way must be destroyed immediately after the person has passed through the security check. It is also important to exclude any form of radiation or effects threatening passenger health. The scanning itself should take the form of random selection, and any refusal should not automatically lead to suspicion. However, any passenger refusing a check must be subjected to an alternative form of security check ensuring an equal level of security.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I think that, at least at their current stage of technological development, security scanners do not offer sufficient guarantees to be able to be used at airports in the European Union. Apart from some of these scanners infringing the right to privacy by producing body images, they also pose a genuine danger to human health. It is said that they produce a permissible quantity of harmful emissions. I want to highlight that this minimum amount of radiation does not disappear from the human body, but accumulates until it reaches a limit at which it has a devastating effect. This is especially dangerous for frequent airline passengers who might need to be subjected to radiation from scanners hundreds of times each year. This is why, as long as the studies and technologies available do not clearly prove …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, this debate shows that the issue of security scanners is not without controversy, but on balance, the advantages prevail in terms of increasing security for our passengers and aircraft in non-intrusive ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal carefully balances considerations of privacy, health and public security. I recall once more that scanners are voluntary; they are voluntary for the airports that use them and, what is of particular importance, they will be voluntary for passengers. This means that if a passenger does not want to be scanned, he can opt for another form of screening.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a question as to whether we put much thought into this issue; I think in this proposal – which was developed after very careful analyses and attempts to find a balance between privacy issues and security issues – that the right balance has been found.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider it particularly important to have harmonised EU rules in this field, because if we do not have harmonisation, then Member States or airports will start doing this on their own. We could have a much more chaotic situation without harmonisation, as each Member State and each airport could take any decision they like. I think that harmonisation is key in this particular area.</p>
      <p sl="en">As it will be approved under comitology, adjustments that would better preserve passenger rights can easily be made following, for example, technological developments. In my introduction, I said that the Commission is also in favour of moving as fast as possible from the present situation to that of stick figures, but it takes time and we have to preserve competition on the market. By having comitology procedures, action could be taken very fast. When we look at developments in this area, changes in the rules could be made rather quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">To summarise, we consider that the proposal is well-balanced, carefully thought through and I think that with this proposal, we will ensure both the privacy of passengers and – what is also extremely important – security. I would like to thank you once again for giving me the possibility to explain the Commission’s position in this House.</p>

      <p sl="lt">As one of the possible technical solutions for guaranteeing safe air transport, the issue of body scanners is very serious as it concerns the safety of citizens through the use of innovative technologies, and I am therefore glad that today, the Commission is providing an assessment of the impact of body scanners on an individual’s health and fundamental human rights. It is undoubtedly very important and essential to guarantee aviation security, but we must ascertain the impact that measures created to ensure this security have on our health, fundamental rights, privacy, dignity and data protection. In the resolution it adopted on the impact of body scanners, and several times during discussions, the European Parliament has expressed concern over the possible infringement of the human right to privacy, the impact of radiation on health and the reasonableness of the cost of acquiring special equipment. Thus, before using body scanners, we must know exactly whether these technical security measures will guarantee effective protection of individuals travelling by air and whether they really will be safe, effective and sound. Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, when applying new technical measures aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also crucial to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, because those measures are not just about protecting citizens, but also about the impact on their health, rights and freedoms.</p>

My first comment is this: I am an enthusiastic supporter of this European fund because when we have problems adjusting to globalisation, it can be used to provide help where it is needed and can also serve to restore people’s faith in globalisation by evening out economic disadvantages that arise as a result of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second comment, however, is as follows: on the other hand, I am not among the sceptics when it comes to adding a specific budget line for this fund because, in my opinion, disasters cannot be planned. I see a very great risk that if we have planned a budget line and the funds have not been exhausted, then money will be distributed and the disaster will more or less be self-organised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Two questions immediately arise. First of all, who is going to stand as a guarantor to such a loan? Ultimately, the loan is supposed to be guaranteed by the European Central Bank, but the ECB has been buying what is normally classified as junk debt from various eurozone countries to the extent that it is, in effect, already a bad bank. So when we talk about the guarantors, we really mean the taxpayers, including the taxpayers of Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second question: From whom are we going to borrow? If somebody had two trillion euros lying around, do you not think they would have used it by now, given the circumstances of the past three years? The truth is we are borrowing from future generations. As the poet said, ‘God omnipotent is mustering (…) in his clouds armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot’. We are freighting future generations with an unprecedented level of debt. Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, lest child, child’s children cry against you woe!</p>

I noticed that I was not the only one who voted against this resolution: there were so many here who want to support democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We all know that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and, for that reason, it should also deserve the broad support of the European Union. We should be true to our own values, our own foundations. In this respect, it is regrettable that the signal going out from here, albeit by a small majority, was otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In any case, I was pleased that there were so many who voted with me against this unsatisfactory resolution, who want to stand by Israel and who also understand that Jerusalem is Israel’s indivisible capital city.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We must work together with democratic countries like Israel, and try to take democracy to Israel’s neighbouring countries, to those states that still do not have it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I feel that most members of the European Parliament are somewhere in the middle on this issue, which means that they are on the side of the people. Naturally, one can dispute whether it is beneficial that Palestine has applied to the UN to be recognised as an independent nation at precisely this point in time.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, I can understand the prevailing concern there that negotiations have been going on for years with no result. The main thing we need now is confidence-building measures, and those are never one-sided; rather, they must come from both sides. In my view, we are also awaiting clear signals from Israel itself. Let us not be under any illusions: the present settlement policy in Israel is neither helpful nor expedient in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Middle East peace process has progressed far too slowly, and that is why I supported the resolution. The Palestinians’ right to autonomy and right to their own state are incontestable, just as Israel, too, obviously has a right to an existence within secure borders. President Abbas’ sense of frustration is understandable: 20 years of peace negotiations is a long, long time. In international politics, however, timeliness is always of the essence.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The ability of the EU to speak with one voice on foreign policy, however, seems once again to be hanging in the balance, which is unfortunate. I hope that the European Union and its Member States will find a common position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and a peaceful solution to it. That is what is required of us.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The only way to achieve lasting peace in the region is through proper political dialogue. The negotiating parties must therefore get round the table and talk. It is now time to cast a glance at what is going to happen after this UN process.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I am unable to support this resolution. I cannot support the way it is worded because, although it urges the parties concerned to return to the negotiating table, which, in itself, is a positive move, it has already started to determine the borders of the states involved and, for example, the status of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have to remember that a precondition for lasting peace and an increase in trust between the parties is that the terms of the peace agreement are not dictated externally: that is to say, the parties should agree on them among themselves. Consequently, the resolution has failed in this respect. If the Member States of the EU recognise a Palestinian state not built on agreement between Israel and the Palestinian administration, it will be a particularly irresponsible and biased act and will not lead to constructive development in the region.</p>

I do feel for the Palestinian people who have been very badly treated; I do believe that they need a state living in peace with Israel, side by side.

As we do this, our Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, is still pushing ahead for a Mercosur deal including the implications of the significant amounts of beef imported into the EU and the deforestation of the Amazon will simply exacerbate that problem.</p>

It is a major issue, Rio+20, and the issues facing the world globally are probably more severe than ever: deforestation, desertification, overfishing, clean water supply and climate change. But they need to be tackled globally and it is no use that the European Union is playing its part, and probably disadvantaging itself, turning more people into poverty, while the rest of the world goes about its merry way.</p>

I am particularly pleased that, in paragraph 46, it was possible to tone down the position on the complete rejection of nuclear energy. Such calls do not reflect the capacities of many Member States, and I am pleased that the European Parliament understands this. We all want a cleaner environment, but if we rejected nuclear energy entirely, it goes without saying that CO2 emissions would increase, along with the threat to energy independence. The energy mix is a matter for the Member States themselves; it is just important to ensure high safety standards since we are also talking about nuclear energy in this case. Of course, sources of renewable energy are very important and they must be developed not just for today, but for the future, and it is disappointing that the European Parliament has been rather critical of the development of unusual sources of energy.</p>

Yes, the resolution also says that we need to make changes and we can improve the functioning of the fund. We certainly can improve its timeliness and look at its cofinancing rates. We also need to ensure that the fund responds properly to the needs of workers, but also deals with issues like skill mismatches.</p>

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 in order to demonstrate solidarity with workers made redundant as a result of changes in world trade patterns and to provide them with assistance. By cofinancing active labour market policy measures, the EGF aimed to facilitate the re-integration into employment of workers in areas, sectors, territories, or labour market regions suffering the shock of serious economic disruption. In light of the scale and speed of development of the financial and economic crisis in 2008, the Commission, in its European Economic Recovery Plan, provided for the revision of the EGF Regulation to widen the scope of the EGF as part of Europe’s crisis response and to turn it into an early, more effective crisis intervention instrument. The amendments to the regulation included the reduction from 1 000 to 500 of the required number of redundancies to trigger an application for EGF support and an extension from 12 to 24 months of the implementation period for EGF supported measures.

It was extended in 2009, via the recovery plan, to cover redundancies caused by the economic and financial crisis as well.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although the fund is criticised for its fairly slow response, one thing for certain is that 10% of all workers made redundant in the EU in 2009 and 2010 received support from it, while 40% of these were successfully reintegrated into the labour market, in spite of the economic crisis. Extending the life of the fund would certainly help at a time when there are signs of the economic crisis returning. However, the EGF’s focus should shift towards effectively supporting the provision of training and retraining for those affected by mass redundancies so that they can be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The main challenge during an extremely tough economic climate is to introduce intervention procedures to enable the EGF to be mobilised quickly and efficiently.

In response to the extent and rapid development of the financial and economic crisis, the Commission planned a revision of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 in its European Economic Recovery Plan. Within the framework of the European response to the crisis, the aim of this revision was to broaden the scope of the fund and make it a more effective intervention instrument in a time of crisis, in accordance with the basic principles of solidarity and social justice. In view of the expected continuing impact of the crisis, leading to the closure of businesses and to the need for fiscal consolidation in the Member States, there is clearly a case for extending the validity of the crisis-related exemption under Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. The proposal is therefore to extend the validity of the temporary crisis-related exemption from 30 December 2011 until 31 December 2013, in other words, up to the end of the implementation period for Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. This will allow the Member States to continue submitting applications for support from the EGF to help workers who are still being laid off as a result of the financial and economic crisis.

I therefore voted in favour of extending the EGF until the end of 2013. I also endorsed the creation of its own specific budget line. Lastly, I supported the alignment of the EGF cofinancing rate with the rate applicable to the Structural Funds. The EGF is one of the best examples of social solidarity that Europe can use to combat the global crisis, and it is therefore essential to make it permanent.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because the Commission is proposing to extend until the end of 2013 the temporary derogation allowing the EGF to be used to support workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. In light of the scale and speed of development of the financial and economic crisis in 2008, the Commission, in its European Economic Recovery Plan, envisaged the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. The aim of this revision was to extend the scope of the EGF as part of Europe’s crisis response and to turn it into an early, more effective crisis intervention instrument. Amendments include the reduction from 1 000 to 500 of the required number of redundancies to trigger an application for EGF support and an extension from 12 to 24 months of the implementation period for EGF supported measures. A temporary derogation was introduced in order (1) to widen the scope of the EGF to cover support in favour of workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the financial and economic crisis and (2) to increase the rate of EGF cofinancing from 50 to 65%. The temporary derogation expires on 30 December 2011.</p>

Adapting to change to maintain a competitive pace in the European economic environment is the main challenge currently facing European companies. Objectives such as employability and equipping with skills and expertise aimed at supporting those made redundant following company relocations or changes in the structure of the global economy must be a priority at the moment and in the future programming period.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to keep pace with globalisation, companies have been obliged to set up in regions that are attractive for the labour market. However, the advantage that these regions enjoy lasts for a limited period. Their development entails making them less attractive, which then means future relocations. While there are currently regions which fully benefit from investors, according to the forecasts, once the basic infrastructure has been developed, these investors will continue their move east towards more attractive third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support extending the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and the increase in the level of cofinancing up to 2013 and even in the future programming period.

If companies are to be helped in difficult times, and that question is a separate debate, let that be done by national or regional authorities.

There is also another reason not to support the extension of the fund: it represents the circulation of money between the capitals and Brussels and thus the expansion of European bureaucracy. Bringing the fund to an end is the only correct course. Moreover, many in the European Parliament are hypocritically granting requests for funds. Many of my fellow Dutch Members did not support these requests in previous votes but, at the beginning of September, when several requests from the Netherlands were being voted on, many of them nonetheless voted in favour. Clearly, they did so in order to appease voters in their own country or region. Moreover, the fund does not help; in fact, the opposite is true.

However, without constructive negotiations, the horrific human rights situation in the West Bank and particularly the Gaza Strip will persist. The EU-backed state-building efforts of Palestinian President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad have been largely successful, thus laying the keystone of a Palestinian state. I would urge Israel to support these initiatives and to halt the settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A peaceful two-state solution is in the long-term interest of both Israelis and Palestinians. Finally, I call on High Representative Ashton and the Member States to reach a common, unified position to help facilitate negotiations and move towards resolving this most protracted of conflicts.</p>

Faced with this confusion, I decided to vote in favour of this resolution, which recognises the legitimacy of Palestine’s request to be recognised as a state in its own right. At the same time, the resolution reaffirms the right of Israel to exist within safe borders and calls for a cessation of rocket attacks. Furthermore, even though the negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis have been at a standstill for several months following the resumption of the illegal settlement building by the State of Israel, we call for direct negotiations between the two sides to be resumed without delay, because the conflict will not be resolved without a negotiated solution.</p>

Whereas Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU stipulates that the choice of ‘energy mix’ is a national competence, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted the EU suddenly to call on the entire world to phase out nuclear power … even though some EU countries produce it and others consume large quantities of it! What right does the European Parliament have to preach in this way? Let us not forget that nuclear energy directly contributes to sustainable development by emitting very little CO2. I am therefore delighted that the amendment that we tabled calling for ‘the highest level of nuclear safety’ and for this requirement to be promoted at international level has been adopted by a very large majority, and that the idea of a general phasing out of nuclear energy has, on the contrary, been rejected.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the Rio+20 Summit because the European Union needs to come up with a united stance on sustainable development. I think that sustainable development policies do not need to be restricted to environmental aspects. Environmental, economic and social policies are interdependent. We are facing a number of challenges to which we need to find solutions: global warming, food insecurity, the ever-rising global unemployment rate and a high level of poverty. The responsibility for this is shared: industrialised and developing countries must adopt specific objectives as part of the UN conference to be held in June 2012. By adopting this resolution today, we are sending a powerful message in this regard. The European Parliament would like the Rio Summit to result in global measures promoting sustainable development, not in political declarations of intent.</p>

It is time that the governments took strong measures to enable the world’s growing population to share its natural resources in a fair and sustainable way. We need a ‘Green Economy Road Map’ with new measures and quantified objectives to achieve sustainable growth. Industrialised countries also have a responsibility to promote sustainable development and the preservation of biodiversity in developing countries.

Rio+20 will be built on the foundations of the previous global summits: the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm (1972), the Conference on Environment and Development (the Earth Summit) in Rio de Janeiro (1992) and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg (2002). It offers a unique opportunity to confirm political commitments in the area of sustainable development. It may be the start of an accelerated, profound and worldwide transition to an environmentally sustainable economy – an economy generating growth, creating jobs and eliminating poverty by investing in and protecting the natural capital on which the long-term survival of our planet depends. At the same time, it could kick off a necessary reform of international governance of sustainable development. We still face global environmental, economic and social challenges on a massive scale. Rio+20 is an important opportunity to promote sustainable development throughout the world. The conference should not only bring about declarations of good intent – only through concrete steps will Rio+20 become a significant milestone in the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy and to better governance.

Despite the progress made in the field of sustainable development, considerable implementation gaps and challenges still remain, and many of the international community’s undertakings have still not been fully met. The Rio Summit will be an excellent opportunity to strengthen political commitment to sustainable development at global level and consolidate the partnership between industrialised and developing countries. The Rio+20 Summit should not only result in statements of good intent but also concrete action and measurable goals and the means of assessing them. Equity is the basis for the fundamental changes that are needed, and they should be implemented at global level, allowing less and the least developed countries, with the help of developed countries, to shorten the normal road to development and achieve a higher level of human wellbeing. The Rio+20 Summit should also discuss an integrated approach to resolving various issues, for example, the eradication of poverty, health, food, employment, gender equality and energy supply. These problems cannot be solved separately, and cooperation is therefore even more important. There is an urgent need to achieve rapid progress in ensuring that the existing international legal framework relating to environmental protection is effective.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The Rio+20 resolution that we have just voted on is an important element in the development of a common EU position ahead of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held in Rio in June 2012. It is, however, a pity that when the resolution was being drafted, many of us succumbed to the temptation to confuse issues that are part of EU internal policy, and regarding which there is no common EU position.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Perhaps the most glaring example of this was Article 46, which reminds people of the risks related to nuclear energy, mentioning the accident at the nuclear power plant in Fukushima in March as an example. There is nothing wrong in this: the facts have to be acknowledged. The text, however, then called for the phasing out of existing nuclear power plants and opposed the building of new nuclear power stations around the world generally. Such statements are likely to reduce the European Parliament’s credibility dramatically. Fortunately, Parliament did not accept this sort of total ban, and my thanks go to my fellow Members for that.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although the accident at Fukushima was very regrettable, I would like to point out that, with modern technology and know-how, nuclear power is of enormous help in the fight against climate change. If nuclear power were now to be banned entirely, in a hurry and with enormous fuss, the effects of using fossil fuels would increase exponentially, since there would still be no credible, fossil-free form of energy that would compete with nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The actual number of victims of the accident at Fukushima will only be seen after many years have passed, when estimates will be made of how the increase in fossil fuels that resulted from abandoning the use of nuclear power in such a hurry has impacted on such phenomena as increased air pollution and deaths from fine particles.</p>

Countries such as the US, France and Japan have made good use of the benefits of the atom, developing this sector within their own countries.

This is happening because demand for energy is increasing quickly, and discoveries of more gas, oil or coal deposits cannot keep up with this demand.

As well as making many observations, the European Parliament mentions a number of proposals that I unreservedly support, such as taking action on a global and local scale; linking sustainable development with the reduction of inequalities and respect for fundamental rights as a matter of importance; and public ownership, without which the policy shift towards a proper environmental policy is not possible. While the European Parliament has once again called for a tax on financial transactions, a large majority has also voted in favour of the requirement to ensure the highest level of nuclear safety as a positive development in this area. Let us be under no illusions, however: grand statements, useful as they are, are not always translated into the action that they recommend. Many governments and MEPs forget their green pledges when a decision displeases the financial sector and major economic decision makers.

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to support measures for those workers who are most affected by massive job losses due to globalisation or the economic and financial crisis in the European Union and to help them reintegrate into the labour market. The EGF was intended to be a measure for rapid intervention in the event of mass redundancy in order to prevent long-term unemployment in difficult labour market conditions. Under the 2009 Economic Recovery Plan, its scope was extended to cover layoffs resulting from the financial and economic crisis. The greatest added value of the renewed EGF would be effective assistance for the training and retraining of workers with a view to helping them find work again in the difficult labour market situation resulting from the unforeseen restructuring of companies or sectors, resulting in or exacerbating a mismatch in vocational skills. Such an instrument would be a useful supplement to the measures funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) aimed primarily at helping with the adjustment to global challenges, and would contribute to sustainable economic growth. This instrument would ensure EU solidarity with workers affected by the negative consequences of restructuring and, on the other hand, would also enable all Member States to take advantage of timely, targeted and tailored help so as to avoid long-term unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has proven, since its creation in 2006, and particularly since the revision and relaxation of its rules in 2009, that it is both useful and relevant in the economic and social crisis that we are currently experiencing. By assisting workers who are suffering as a result of the crisis, it is the expression of European solidarity. True, it is a crisis management instrument that can be rather slow, but its added value is plain to see. We must therefore maintain it, and that is why we are in favour of extending the derogation until the end of 2013.</p>

However, I do not share the Commission’s desire to continue the EGF beyond the current multiannual financial framework. The EGF should be closely linked to the European framework for restructuring, in order to increase its contribution to effective support for the training and retraining of workers, with a view to reintegrating them into employment in the difficult labour market situations that result from unexpected company or sectoral restructuring, which creates or aggravates skills mismatches. Such an instrument would provide a valuable complement to those measures financed by the European Social Fund which are aimed predominantly at adapting to global challenges, with a view to sustainable economic growth. On the one hand, this instrument would ensure EU solidarity with workers adversely affected by restructuring and, on the other, all Member States could benefit from its timely, targeted and tailored intervention, the aim of which is to prevent long-term unemployment.</p>

The continuation of the crisis calls for this broadening of the fund to be maintained and for the procedures for mobilising it to be tailored to the actual predicament of the workers and regions concerned. I hope that the recommended changes will fulfil their purpose of bringing help to those who need it most and reacting quickly to the instances of deprivation that affect them.

It was designed as a rapid intervention instrument for cases of mass redundancy, with the aim of avoiding long-term unemployment in difficult labour market conditions. Its original aim as an instrument was to mitigate as quickly as possible the pressing and unforeseen problems on the labour market caused by the laying off of large numbers of workers, whether from big firms or from small enterprises operating in a specific sector and a specific region. I also consider it important to emphasise that, in future, most of the attention should go to sustainable labour market measures, and that we should endeavour to create the conditions for Member States to make use of the EGF to fulfil European objectives and promote new skills, including skills connected with new, sustainable and high-quality ‘green’ jobs. The EGF should also continue to finance only those active labour market measures which supplement the measures under national legislation for cases of mass redundancy, and it would be a good idea, in my opinion, for the Commission to follow the implementation process more closely, in order to ensure that the measures are equally useful to all workers.</p>

While, in 2009, the EGF was able to help some 40% of the workers concerned to re-enter the labour market, in a difficult economic climate, we should consider the fact that it is, in a way, a very convenient remedy for the lack of a European industrial strategy and for the social damage caused by the relocation of large multinationals which, in the end, often emerge from the difficulties they encounter in a very strong position. That being the case, we must insist that the social partners and the local authorities be closely involved in the application procedure and play a part in monitoring the implementation and assessment of the results on behalf of workers. Lastly, in the future, the EGF should be integrated into a European framework for anticipating and managing restructuring exercises and should emphasise the social responsibility of multinational companies, which seldom fail to exploit this type of instrument in order to reduce the costs of a restructuring exercise that they alone have decided.</p>

The European Globalisation Fund has been essential to assist European workers who found themselves on the losing side of globalisation, especially since the behaviour of market speculators triggered the severe financial and economic crisis we find ourselves in. There is a need to address serious issues, such as the slow and cumbersome nature of the EGF procedures and the problems we face to secure national funding to match the EU’s share. The deadline for availing of EGF funds must not count from the start of such complex and lengthy procedures, as this results in lost funding opportunities for workers in need of assistance. In the Dell workers’ case in Ireland, the EGF fund helped contribute to start new enterprises which created 240 jobs and retrained or up-skilled many hundreds more.

However, some Member States, like the UK, have not yet used the EGAF and I welcome the position taken today in the resolution to urge the Commission to investigate the reasons for this. Finally, I agree that the Commission needs to clarify its plans for extending the scope of the EGAF to agricultural sectors before any decisions can be taken.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained from the vote on this report, which amends the criteria of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This fund is used to finance a number of social plans, with the specific aim of helping to train workers who have been made redundant and of facilitating their return to work. It is therefore difficult to vote against, but the very name of the fund already covers an entire programme, and I refuse to back a scheme that encourages social dumping, among other things, within the European Union. Worse, it is the redundancies made from large multinationals as a result of stock market developments that are the specific targets of this fund, when multinationals are the ones who should be paying for the reintegration of their employees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European peoples hit hard by this crisis do not expect the European Union to give them handouts or to replace the Member States in their role as guarantors of national solidarity. Rather, they expect it to finally build a social Europe that ensures that workers’ rights are put before shareholders’ interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note, however, that the European Parliament is seeking further guarantees to ensure that the appropriations cannot be used indirectly to benefit multinationals that lay people off, as it has already done in the past with Unilever in particular. The Fralib workers expect better.</p>

Nevertheless, efforts will have to be made in the coming weeks to improve these agreements and the agreement on agriculture in particular. Our Parliament must demand that the future agreement be balanced and protect both small farmers in Morocco and fruit and vegetable producers in Europe.

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 90(2) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, concerns an opinion requested from the Court of Justice on the compatibility with the Treaties of the Protocol to the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement. The EU has maintained trade relations with Morocco for several years now, particularly in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean region and, on 7 March 2010, the first EU-Morocco Summit was held. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and as far as codecision is concerned, no agreement can be concluded without first being approved by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Taking account of the fact that this protocol is extending its scope to cover the waters of the Western Sahara, the population of which, despite retaliation from the Moroccan Government, is calling for the right to self-determination, the EU, as a community of values standing for democracy and respect for human rights, cannot sign protocols that violate international law, as is the case with this new Protocol as regards the socio-economic interests of the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Western Sahara and the exploitation of its natural resources.

The application of the new Protocol extends, however, to the waters off the coast of Western Sahara, which has been on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories since 1963. In order to comply with international law, however, economic activities relating to the natural resources of a Non-Self-Governing Territory must be carried out for the benefit of the people of such a territory, and in accordance with their wishes. Since it has not been demonstrated that the Union’s financial contribution is used for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara, there is legal uncertainty as to whether the new Protocol complies with international law as regards the socio-economic interests of the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Western Sahara and the exploitation of its natural resources.

In order to prevent Parliament, which unfortunately has been consulted far too late, from having its decision-making powers blocked, I chose to abstain by taking the view that the debate should focus not on this resolution but on the Protocol. Furthermore, since the fishermen are already fishing off the Moroccan coast, Parliament’s vote will only have a retroactive effect. If we want to obtain proper guarantees from the Commission and the Moroccan Government regarding the benefits of these activities for all the populations concerned and regarding the economic importance that they represent for the EU, then it is on the future agreement, which will replace the previous agreement from February onwards, that we will have to focus all our efforts.

This request was futile on more than one account: • it undermined the previous legal opinions issued by the European institutions and the United Nations; • it risked setting a precedent; • it involved the Court of Justice of the European Union in an issue concerning the Member States’ sovereignty; • it represented insensitive political interference when we know that the dispute between Morocco and Western Sahara is still not over; • it concerned a one-year agreement, with the risk that the Court would address the issue even though the agreement was no longer in force; • it involved the suspension of all discussions within the European Parliament.</p>

Fishing boats from the EU have been active for years off the coast of Western Sahara, to which the new agreement is to be extended; something that was clearly ruled out until now. According to an opinion issued by the European Parliament’s legal service published in 2010, the fisheries activities off the coast of Western Sahara are illegal – particularly in view of the status of Western Sahara as a Non-Self-Governing Territory under Article 73 of the UN Charter. I did not vote in favour of the report because the Moroccan Government – ignoring numerous UN Security Council decisions and an opinion issued by the International Court of Justice – regards Western Sahara as its territory, but actually has no sovereign rights over it. Consequently, by extending the agreement, the EU would be endorsing Morocco’s illegal territorial claims.</p>

It will also have drastic economic and social consequences for the respective local communities because, for the time being, there are no alternative fishing grounds with identical characteristics, either in terms of their geographical proximity to Portugal or in terms of the type of fishing gear authorised for use and the target species (demersal species).

The European Parliament fears that international law will be infringed by the new fisheries protocol due to the exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Western Sahara. I feel that the European Court of Justice could create legal certainty here and that this could also provide an opportunity to get a step closer to resolving the Western Sahara issue.

The status of the region under international law must be clarified. A court ruling on the territory of Western Sahara would bring about clarity in respect of relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. Nonetheless, this resolution comes at the wrong time. Had it been passed, the resolution would have de facto blocked the EU’s fisheries agreement with Morocco, since this expires on 28 February 2012, and it is unlikely that the European Court of Justice would have passed a ruling by this date.
