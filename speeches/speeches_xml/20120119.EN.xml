      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, whom I particularly welcome, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, those of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), whom I thank for the support and cooperation they have provided from the very outset for my initiative of an oral question with a resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain. I would also thank all the political groups that have supported this oral question and worked determinedly on drafting the final text of this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This resolution is in response to the expectations of farmers, which have been put off for a long time, of reversing the growing imbalances in the food supply chain, in terms of both negotiating power between the parties and of income distribution. This has been provoked by the high concentration of Europe’s largest retailers and threatens the survival of farmers and suppliers in general, severely damaging the agricultural economy and rural societies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The means proposed to this end are unequivocal identification of the bad practices in the food supply chain, support for its self-regulation through joint action by all stakeholders, demand for adequate legislation by the European Commission, not forgetting the commitment needed from Member States in this area, supervision and penalties. The Union legislation needed should take into account previous decisions of the European Parliament, both those that were implemented and those that have not been realised, to which will be added the responses considered here to be suited to the present situation as regards contractual relationships between producers, suppliers and retailers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This resolution is not being set up against any of the partners in the food supply chain, but to give them closer relations and implement dialogue, so everyone’s contribution is required. This resolution is being set up against the unfair and abusive practices that have started to become established and is intended to introduce appropriate EU and national legislation, where necessary, without distorting the smooth running of the markets. As such, it is hoped it will encourage producers to have greater capacity for organising amongst themselves, and retailers to abandon dominating practices, such as the unilateral imposition of contractual conditions or practices relating to discounts, without increasing the price to the consumer but rather contributing to their having a real choice that is wider and of higher quality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are now awaiting the required initiative from the European Commission.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="28311" name="Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know it is increasingly hard to be a farmer in Europe. The figures speak for themselves. According to Eurostat, production costs have gone up 40% over the last decade, whilst prices have not increased by more than 25%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is not just upstream that farmers are being completely squeezed. Farmers downstream are also obliged to accept unimaginable prices, payment times and other contractual conditions, because of the disproportionate correlation of forces existing in the marketing chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall give the example of my own country, where the cooperative sector has little importance. Around 65% of sales of food products are concentrated in the hands of the five largest companies, with the figures much higher for some sectors, such as milk. Just last week, in my country, the authorities learned that 400 000 litres of milk on the marketing chain were being sold at below cost price.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As political decision makers, we need to ensure that agriculture remains a viable activity in Europe, producing good-quality foodstuffs and raw materials at fair prices that provide a living for farmers. To this end, there is a need for a sound common agricultural policy, but also for fair competition, as mentioned in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to follow up urgently the recommendations and suggestions formulated in the resolutions we are discussing here today, and for concrete proposals to be tabled as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="1318" name="James Nicholson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I congratulate Mr Bové on his report on the farm input supply chain. It raises some very topical issues. We are all well aware that the rising cost of inputs – most notably for feed, fuel and fertiliser – is putting major pressure on farmers and continues to squeeze their margins in an economic climate that is already difficult, especially for the intensive sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically, the cost of feed has to be addressed; rising costs will force us to rethink our attitude, I believe, about soya imports from third countries and the problems associated with the protein deficit in the EU. I do not believe that domestic protein production can satisfy demand, especially if we wish to increase food production for reasons of food security. Moreover, rising food costs do not seem to result in higher farm gate prices and this has to be looked at for the benefit of both the consumer and the farmer. Large retailers must be prepared to cooperate with producers in order to ensure that the distribution of profits along the chain is equal and fair.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU imposes the strictest standards on animal welfare, environmental practices and food safety. I support the fact that the EU is the world leader in this regard, but I also think we have to find a balance between maintaining the highest standards and risking over-legislating our farmers out of business.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear the proposals from the Commission regarding the reform of the CAP go in that direction, especially in relation to greening and direct payments and the ridiculous set-aside proposal. With regard to the issue of imbalances in the food chain, it is clear that the power of retailers has grown to what some consider to be an unacceptable level. While there are some measures the EU can take, especially as regards transparency and profits in the chain, I think that farmers need to look at how they can organise themselves better and increase their bargaining power, whether through producer organisations or cooperatives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like to use all the time available to me for this debate now, if possible; all four minutes, since I have a further two minutes later.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I have a further two minutes and I should like to use them all together now, if possible. I would therefore ask you to set the clock to zero.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the problem of farmers’ incomes is getting more serious, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized farmers and family farms, of which there are significant numbers in many Member States. Consumer prices do not reflect the prices paid to farmers for their products. The unsustainable increase in the costs of factors of production – fuel, feed, fertilisers, plant-health products, etc. – is happening at the same time as a persistent decline in the prices of products.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The consequences are the abandonment of agriculture, the unstoppable closure of farms, the desertification of the countryside, the concentration of production in the hands of large producers, and production that is increasingly intensive and geared towards exports. Imbalances between the Member States are growing; the food deficits and food dependence of countries with weaker production systems are growing; the threats to food security and sovereignty are growing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">None of this is new. All this is well known, and the causes of this profoundly negative development are also well known: the lack of instruments for regulating agricultural production, of regulation of the markets; the immeasurably increasing power of the major retailers and their abuses; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the application of World Trade Organisation rules to agriculture; and the entry of speculators into the foodstuffs market. In short, the agricultural and trade policies in force: the common agricultural policy, the common commercial policy, and the patterns on which the single market has been established and is being deepened in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Resolution of all these problems will not, therefore, be possible without profoundly changing these policies. There is a need for mechanisms regulating the food supply chain that defend producers – particularly small and medium-sized farmers, who promote employment in the countryside and bring it to life – and for reductions in food imports.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is crucial to halt and reverse the present concentration of power in the hands of the major retailers and industry. There is a need for a decentralisation of the food supply chains, for support for and promotion of local production and consumption, for shorter food supply chains, and for local markets, including using innovative media like the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a need for measures intended to put a stop to dumping between Member States, as is happening in the milk sector, for example. There is a need for fair distribution of value added throughout the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We believe consideration should be given to the establishment of ceilings for companies’ profit margins using the price paid to producers as a benchmark, particularly for large supermarkets and retailers, and to putting a permanent stop to self-regulation, which is nothing short of a myth. There is a need to create and operate national systems for monitoring and shaping prices and price changes in retailers and large supermarkets, whilst steadfastly combating the current practices of cartelisation and price manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a need for a system of production quotas: a quota system adapted to the needs of each country and to its development in terms of production equipment, so as to enable the development of the Member States with higher deficits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For reasons of environmental, economic and social sustainability, there is also a need to organise international trade in such a way that producers, products and countries complement each other, rather than competing, as currently happens. The vitality of the economic and social fabric in the primary sector is dependent on this, not just in Europe, but in other countries too, especially in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These, amongst many others, were some of the proposals included in the resolution tabled by our group. Unfortunately, we cannot find many of them in the report or in the other resolutions. We therefore hope that some of these proposals may be adopted here today.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, if we are talking about the European Union as a union of equal states, then it is precisely this policy of equality that we should pursue consistently. Direct payments to farmers producing agricultural products in European Union Member States must not vary, with some being paid two, three or even four times as much as others, because it is precisely these differences that orchestrate the problems which will prevent us from ever achieving balance in the food supply chain. Food production and supply chain costs are increasing for various reasons, such as increasing plant health, animal welfare, environmental protection, hygiene and food safety requirements, which are all the same for all Member States. However, the different levels of payments in European Union Member States are marginalising food producers so much that fair competition is completely out of reach.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Attention must also be drawn to another important issue – large distribution companies currently dominate food markets, and prices paid to farmers in the food supply chain are constantly being cut. At the same time, production costs continue to rise. Farmers are not receiving sufficient income for their products, while big commercial monopolies are making huge profits at the farmers’ expense. Due to the significant variation between the price paid to farmers and the final price paid by consumers, as well as the lack of transparency, the difference in competitive conditions and, in some cases, abuse in the food supply chain, farming is becoming no longer viable and farmers’ survival is under threat. I believe that the primary task of the Commission and the Member States today is to guarantee that competition rules, which operate on principles of equality, are upheld throughout the upstream and downstream food market chain.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, also on behalf of Mr Cioloş, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bové, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) for the report, and I would like to thank those who submitted oral questions about imbalances in the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="it">The prices of the means of agricultural production, of input costs, have reached record levels in recent years, although they have not been matched by a corresponding rise in the output prices of agricultural products. Despite the fact that the real prices of inputs rose by almost 18% between 2005 and 2011, agricultural prices have risen more slowly. Farm revenues also fell by more than 10% in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis, and only returned to pre-crisis levels in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">Volatility in basic agricultural commodity prices is also increasingly reflected in farm revenues, and has accentuated farmers’ loss of negotiating power in the food supply chain. Farmers therefore have to deal with a growing number of difficulties relating to the rise in input costs, as well as to improving their environmental and agronomic efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is AGRI doing to help farmers deal with these difficulties? Our work has concentrated on these problems, which are dealt with, on the one hand, within the framework of the proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) presented in October, and, on the other, in the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain that we launched a year ago with Mr Cioloş, Mr Dalli and Mr Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="it">The recent proposal for the CAP reform after 2013 introduces innovations aiming to increase cooperation between farmers and to clarify the scope of competition rules. The proposals also aim to facilitate the creation of producers’ organisations and associations, as well as of inter-professional organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The mandatory recognition of producer organisations is a key element of the European Union. The Commission’s proposals also include cofinancing for their creation in all Member States, regardless of the type of farming, through the second pillar of rural development.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, economies of scale will help sales by increasing the number of distribution channels and reducing risks and this, in turn, will also foster a better division of added value within the supply chain. Furthermore, our proposal with regard to contractual relations in the dairy industry aims to strengthen the position of dairy producers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The issue of crop diversity, which was raised in the report, is also dealt with in the proposal for reform of the CAP as part of the commitment to help the environment. The European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability and awards for innovative local cooperation in rural areas will help to promote innovative measures throughout the food supply chain. The partnership could include projects for rationalising the use of resources, precision agriculture and so on.</p>
      <p sl="it">The CAP reform will also involve boosting the agricultural consultancy system, which will bring about better exchange of good practices and information campaigns targeting farmers and consumers. Another important topic is seeds, and an action plan is currently being developed as a follow-up to the legislation assessment carried out in 2010-2011 on the sale of seeds and reproduction materials. Adoption of a Commission proposal is scheduled for the third quarter of this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report also refers to land prices and land rent as raised by Mr Bové in his speech. The writers of a study in 2010 attempted to identify the ratio between land prices and direct payments. The Commission is ready to carry out other studies that will give a better idea of the impact of farm rents and leases on agriculture input costs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The last point I would like to discuss, also in response to the point raised by Mr Bové in his speech, before moving on to the other issues more closely linked to imbalances in the food supply chain, concerns energy and water. Improving the way enterprises use water is a win-win situation for all those involved. As well as allowing farmers to reduce their costs, it has a positive impact on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second pillar of the CAP includes mechanisms for promoting the production of renewable energies inside and outside farms located in rural areas, the transformation of agricultural and forest biomass, and investments in rationalising the use of resources also as a means of saving energy. The measures provided for in this second pillar also offer many possibilities for optimising the management of water resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">Honourable Members, the imbalances and abuses in the food supply chain are currently further aggravated by price volatility, a problem raised by the three oral questions which are subjects the Commission is focusing on in particular. Unfair commercial practices between companies can take place at all levels of the food supply chain. They are a threat to farmers, to small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees, and often also to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, what measures should we adopt? Until today, at European level, unfair commercial practices have mainly been tackled in the context of the relations between companies and consumers. As far as relations between companies are concerned, the EU has adopted measures against contractual terms and conditions and commercial practices that are clearly unfair due to delays in payments. The directive should become effective before the end of March 2013, but I recently wrote to all the ministers involved to invite them to anticipate the entry into force of this law, which is a practical application of the ‘Small Business Act’. We estimate, in fact, that this directive will help to inject around EUR 180 billion into the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is also a directive on misleading and comparative advertising, which aims to guarantee proper practices and sets rules for the authorisation of comparative advertising. Along with the communication ‘Towards a Single Market Act’, the report on monitoring distribution, and following on from this Parliament’s own-initiative report adopted last July on a more efficient, fairer retail market – the Corazza Bildt report – the Commission has also scheduled the adoption of a communication on unfair commercial practices this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">This text should clearly define the scope and breadth of the problem in retail sales and underline the fragmentary nature of national rules and their application. Madam President, I am sorry if my speech has been longer than expected, but there have been so many questions and they have been so complex; I will be much briefer in my response.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission also consulted the interested parties to find out what their perception is in the ‘European Business Test Panel’, and is currently analysing the responses it received. Once we have evaluated the data we have collected, we will look at possible spheres of action for remedying the various problems we found.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, this year, we plan to adopt a communication on the directive on misleading and comparative advertising. On a national level, some Member States have already adopted important tools to foster the management of commercial relations between companies, commercial law, policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, and laws and codes of conduct against unfair practices. The Commission has given the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain a mandate to work, among other things, on contractual relations between companies and on price transparency.</p>
      <p sl="it">The representatives of the agricultural sector, industry, commerce and distribution recently came to an agreement about a document on vertical relations within the food supply chain and the principles of good practice, which proposes a common definition of fairness in relations between companies. The document also proposes guidelines for commercial relations between companies, accompanied by concrete examples of unfair and fair practices.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the measures for applying these principles have not yet been evaluated, and therefore there is still an additional, delicate task to carry out. Based on the progress over the next few months, the Commission will make a decision as to whether to continue to encourage this consensual approach or, in the absence of a satisfactory agreement between the parties, it reserves the right to weigh up possible legislative action. At the moment, the Commission does not have a preferred option, and considers all alternatives valid, including the one suggested in the report by Mr Bové.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, as already announced in the communication ‘A Better Functioning Food Supply Chain in Europe’, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of the raw materials derivative markets, including agricultural commodities. These proposals specifically concern over-the-counter derivatives, financial instruments markets and market abuse.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you are well aware, the proposals are currently being debated by Parliament and the Council. Thank you for your attention, and I apologise once more to the President if my speech has been longer than planned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, oh to be a Commissioner and be able to have so much time to speak! It was good to hear your fulsome response, Commissioner. I have less time but I will be quite blunt. I would like you to take the comments in this debate as armour and weapons into your struggles on this matter. This House is united about one issue, which is that there is a problem at both ends – and, indeed, in the centre – of the food supply chain. The Bové report, which was an initiative of mine in the EPP Group – and I thank Mr Bové for his work on it – deals with the farm input problem. It is serious, and you have acknowledged that. At the other end, we have had the excellent work of my colleague, Mrs Patrão Neves, on the imbalance of power and the need to look at this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly pleased by your words, and I quote you here, that you will ‘reserve the right to legislate’. I think the stakeholders should listen with concern and be prepared to face legislation if there is no cooperation and effective change on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you mentioned the financial services sector. I think you were right to do that. There is a huge parallel between what has happened in financial services – to the discredit of the European Union – and what is happening in the food supply chain. My interest in this House is in the food supply chain. Food security is fundamental. Are you, as Commissioner, prepared to watch over the destruction of this if we do not take action now?</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me warn you that, though we have been up early for this debate, there are others in the food chain who have been up much earlier and are taking from the pockets of producers, both their pockets, to cushion their own profits. Some of the practices that are going on you do not even know and we do not fully understand. There is something rotten in this system, and unless politicians have the bottle to call it rotten, there will be no change. Take this debate to the Commission and take action.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, allow me to make three comments which relate mainly to the farm input supply chain, but which also affect the food production chain. Firstly, I should like to emphasise that the smooth operation of the food market is inextricably bound up with the smooth operation of the farm input supply market and vice versa. Therefore, regulations are needed that will safeguard transparency in input pricing and the application of, and compliance with, competition rules both by the input supply chain and in the agri-food chain.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, I should like to point out that the quality of traditional crop seeds should be linked to the cultural heritage of the Member States, in the same way as the agricultural product quality policy. I therefore think that it is important to create a European bank for seeds to store and maintain the genetic variety of traditional plants and combat the current loss of biodiversity in traditional varieties.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, I should like to point out that rational use of inputs and resources requires far more than the application of rules. It requires a change of attitude, knowledge and skills on the part of farmers, so that they can adopt the most productive, viable and innovative cultivation systems under the circumstances. As we all understand, that depends on both innovative and institutional improvements and a high standard of training. I trust that the new common agricultural policy will take all this into account.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to praise Mr Bové for the work he has done. Now, I would like to talk in very simplified terms, that is to say, my message is perhaps not directed at my fellow Members, but at those who are currently buying their own food.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The big problem for the EU’s farmers, and perhaps their only economic problem, is that they are shamelessly poorly paid for their work. The input chain is extremely large and, I would like to point out, extremely profitable. The food industry is reasonably profitable, and in the trading chain, it is, in fact, quite easy these days to become a prosperous small business.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the midst of this gigantic chain is the individual farmer, and even if we regard him or her as a large farmer, he or she is an almost invisible link in the large food supply chain, despite the fact that it is the farmer who is the really important converter of inputs into raw materials for the next link in the chain.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to ask you to imagine for a moment that if farmers were sufficiently well paid for what they sold on the market, then the EU’s income subsidies could, in fact, be converted into investment capital for rural development, the environment, climate change, animal care and infrastructure. Think what resources we would have available to us the day that farmers were paid a reasonable amount for the work they do!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will be no exception in congratulating my colleague, José Bové, for this very timely and very powerful report. It pulls together a number of the interlocking and mutually reinforcing factors which are impacting on our food supply chain and making the lives of European and global farmers more difficult. Indeed, there are times when the economics of farming are not so much a science as more of a voodoo cult. It is amazing that anybody is actually in farming at all and that we have any food to eat.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that the increased concentration of market power downstream of farming, in processing industries, trade companies and supermarkets, and upstream of farming, in terms of increasing costs for fertilisers, energy, feed, seed, water, loans and land rent, is undermining the proper functioning of the food supply chain in Europe. Farmers are facing a squeeze between rising costs for input and low farm gate prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">For those colleagues – usually those not present in these debates – who have suggested that the free market is working, I have some statistics from the Scottish Agricultural College report on power in agriculture – actual statistics on market concentration – showing that four companies worldwide account for 75-90%, by some measures, of global grain trade, seven companies control all fertiliser supply, five companies share 68% of the global agrochemical market, and three companies control almost 50% of the proprietary seeds market. If you add to that the supermarkets’ and processors’ power, it really is surprising that our farmers are in business at all. So to those who would say that the free market in agriculture is working – well, prima facie, no it is not.</p>
      <p sl="en">We saw what happened – as other colleagues have mentioned – with the breakdown of the interbank lending market earlier in this economic crisis. It is the poorest who are hit hardest, and our citizens are very much in the frame for this. So I was delighted, Commissioner, to hear your fulsome presentation this morning, and I hope you will gather from this debate that this House is looking for more action from the Commission, not less. We are your ally in this and, if anything, we want to see more urgent activity from the Commission on the many issues raised in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to see further action because this is not going to go away or get better. Quite the reverse – the market is concentrating further day by day in a world where we are increasingly seeing instability in energy prices, global instability and its political knock-on effects, and climate change making parts of the world wetter, parts of the world drier, and all of the world more climatically unstable. We are not going to see our food supply chain getting calmer.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to act on this urgently. CAP reform has never been more urgent and this report deserves to be absolutely fundamental in all our minds as we take forward the CAP reform project with you, Commissioner. We look forward to that effort.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, during the course of the previous term, we managed, in this House, to adopt a resolution calling for opposition to the abuse by major retail chains of their dominant position in respect to their consumers and, most importantly, in respect to farmers. I was one of the co-authors of this document and I remember that while organising a press conference after its adoption, some of the agricultural organisations that had supported the collection of signatures for the declaration even asked not to be mentioned publicly, fearing potential reprisal from major retail chains. This illustrates the scale of the problem. Both in EU law as well as in the law of the Member States, legal instruments exist which allow us to deal with the situation effectively, and these legal instruments should be applied.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw attention to distortions in competition which result from the unequal rights of our farmers. This manifests itself both in external competition, in the area of unequal standards and the higher requirements that our farmers face in comparison to importers, as well as in internal competition, in the area of unequal subsidies. This is a very serious problem, which also distorts the agricultural market of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, I should also like to commend Mr Bové on his report. One can sense that it has been drawn up by a real farmer, who feels the pain of farmers. For my own part, I should like to say that a situation has arisen throughout the world where agricultural products are now used both in food and in energy production. Grain is used for bioethanol, rape for biodiesel, maize for biogas, and so on. As a result, financial resources that used to circulate on the fossil fuel market are now also flowing into the food production sector and are causing excessive price fluctuations. In my view, the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, pay more attention to these issues, and should, as swiftly as possible, develop a mechanism to prevent financial speculation on the food market based on this factor. Too little thought is being devoted to questions of increasing soil fertility. I think that the European Commission should draw up and adopt a package of administrative measures to increase farmers’ economic autonomy and use of the required resources. Honest, fair and economically justified direct payments are one of the possibilities for farmers to reduce the negative effect of fluctuations in the supply of resources on stability in agricultural production. The utmost attention must therefore be paid to these matters, and we must demand accountability. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, during my farming lifetime, I have seen wheat yields triple, and during my farming lifetime, I have seen sugar beet yields triple. In addition to that, those sugar beet have gone from being randomly monogerm to consistently monogerm, and all that is down to the efforts of plant breeders. They have to be rewarded for the work that they do. They are in great competition with other plant breeders and the farmer, I can assure you, is the most brutal customer of the lot. If he does not like a variety, he will drop it like a stone. The price of failure for a plant breeder is very high indeed: it is 10 years’ work straight down the drain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Somebody was talking about maintaining seed banks. I can assure you that the seed breeders themselves do that. Actually, seed is one of the farm inputs that farmers have a huge degree of control over, and in the UK, a farmer has three choices. He can either maintain an old variety on which no royalty is payable, or he can multiply up a new variety. He will then have to declare that he has done so and pay a modest acreage royalty. He can expect to be inspected, or he can simply buy a bag of seed where the royalty is part of the price. All of these things he can do. This works well in the UK. I do not see the necessity to call on the Commission to interfere in this in any way at all.</p>

      <p sl="en">I will give you an example of the market. I am an egg producer – free-range eggs. They were in surplus in 2011 – no subsidy on that.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, may I thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue and the focus that he brings to a wide variety of problems that farmers are facing today. Whilst the rapporteur highlights generally the problems in terms of cost of production versus farm gate prices, in Northern Ireland – despite these difficulties – agriculture continues to contribute to the economy. We have heard colleagues say today that this really is quite a miracle, given the problems that farmers face.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland has grown significantly, accounts for 20% of sales from the manufacturing industry and now, in a very small region, provides 50 000 direct jobs. We should recognise the absolute importance of this industry to our economy. It is an industry which has proved resilient in difficult economic conditions and should provide further private-sector growth if given the proper support and freedom from oppressive legislation. There is no doubt that many of the issues raised by the report are valuable, but I believe that the greatest contribution that we can make to a sustainable and competitive sector is in producing a common agricultural policy that sees food production and European food security as its aim and objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over recent weeks, I have been talking to farmers in my own constituency and they see the proposals from the Commission as complex, overbearing in terms of environmental objectives and favouring landowners over active food-producing farmers. In our discussions on CAP reform, if we miss the opportunity to provide an environment for increased productivity and one which provides food and supply security, we will only continue to increase price volatility for farmers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, Commissioner, I was interested in your brief run-down on some of the common agricultural policy proposals. You mentioned specifically crop rotation, as has been envisaged in the Pillar One proposal. In Northern Ireland, this is seen as much too prescriptive and almost certainly will put small mixed farms out of work. It is simply not workable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg.</p>
      <p sl="de">You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food.</p>
      <p sl="de">What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very timely debate, and I would add my congratulations to José Bové for a well balanced report that highlights the real problems that farmers face because, as other speakers have pointed out, on the one hand, farmers are selling their produce to a handful of very powerful multinational retailers, and, on the other hand, they are purchasing their inputs from a handful of very powerful agrochemical or agro-industry multinational suppliers. The result, of course, is that farmers are squeezed from both sides by these huge and powerful companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">This highlights the urgent need for action in the CAP reform and in other areas where the Commission is taking action to try and help this matter. We need to strengthen the hand of farmers when it comes to negotiating (a) with the retailers, and (b) with their input suppliers. If we can achieve that, what will then happen is a better return for farmers, a better margin, and less reliance on the need for taxpayers’ support in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one particular area that I think needs immediate action from the Commission, and that is in regard to the fertiliser market. If I could give you the example, Commissioner, of the UK fertiliser market, there is a monopoly manufacturer for nitrogen fertiliser called GrowHow. It is 50% owned by its largest competitor Yara, which is the largest fertiliser manufacturer in the world. The other half of GrowHow is owned by CF Industries, which is the largest manufacturer of nitrogen-based fertilisers in North America. Surely this level of consolidation means there is little real competition in the UK marketplace. I suspect this is replicated throughout the rest of Europe. The only competition they face is from the blenders, but they, unfortunately, have to buy their nitrogen from that same supplier.</p>
      <p sl="en">So between 2003 and 2009, output prices for agricultural products increased by 35%, their inputs increased by 42%, but fertiliser increased by 173%. That is evidence that the market is failing. Commissioner, could you give me a guarantee that you will investigate this matter and ask the Competition Commissioner to look closely at how the fertiliser market is operating in the EU?</p>

Mr Lyon spoke about this just now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The latest Bové report extends a helping hand to active farmers and it sets out a strategy for an agricultural policy that is more socially responsible and that ensures a decent income for farmers. It is also a policy that is greener. A policy with an even greater concern for sustainable agricultural practices. A policy that also makes a concrete contribution to the fight against climate change. A policy that is also directed against the ruthless monopolies of seed and food giants.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, European agriculture is going through a difficult period because, among other things, the entire EU has expanded dramatically over the past decade through the accession of new Member States. Competition on the agricultural market has grown considerably, and all farmers in Europe are now feeling the competitive pressure. Many of them are coping well with this, but some are unable to face the pressure and are gradually leaving the sector. This is natural and proper, however, and any effort to prevent it would, in my view, be doomed to fail. We must, on the contrary, assist the agricultural sector by removing the unnecessary regulations and quotas which hinder agricultural development. Ending the quotas and ceilings on wine, milk, sugar and other items will also provide an opportunity for growth in the agricultural sector. It is these quotas that are a barrier to the growth of European agriculture, and it is also necessary to facilitate the operation of alternative distribution channels, such as farm sales or the farmers’ markets that have seen successfully rising sales in the Czech Republic and elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in an effort to keep the prices of agricultural produce stable, we are looking for a variety of measures that could eliminate the adverse impact of rising input prices on agricultural production.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In view of the fact that we cannot realistically maintain prices in respect of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds or water at a stable level in the long term, I am under no illusions that our efforts would be successful. In an open market environment, it is always justified that higher input prices and production costs are reflected in the cost price of the product. I therefore think that, in our efforts to solve the problems of the food chain, we should focus more on addressing the imbalances and inequalities in the relationship between agricultural primary production and the processing sector or retail chains, because it is in this area in particular that the most significant price distortions occur, to the detriment of primary production.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not claim that all is well in the area of inputs for agricultural enterprises, such as the supply of seeds. In my opinion, however, the most significant price distortions are in the chain between primary production and processors or trade.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I find it very positive that we are now looking into the problems upstream of farm production in a new own-initiative report. In so doing, I believe that we should pay particular attention to the reduction of input costs. It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, these have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. Thus, for example, energy costs in agriculture rose by around 60% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices only rose by 25%. The rapporteur’s suggestion of setting up a price monitoring agency is certainly the right way to go. We have to succeed in increasing competition in the input sector, thus bringing about more attractive prices for farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is well known that farmers, for their part, are already attempting to work together more closely in a number of areas and thus exploit their potential when it comes to efficiency savings. In the medium and the long term, however, it will be necessary to provide farmers – especially those who farm organically – with a better price environment for their products so that we can ensure their long-term survival, especially in outlying alpine regions.</p>

Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious.</p>
      <p sl="es">Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards.</p>
      <p sl="es">Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.</p>

      <p sl="es">For this reason, it is necessary, at Community level, to strengthen existing legislation on agricultural contracts, inter-branch organisations and producers’ organisations, as well as promoting instruments such as price observatories, which analyse the price formation process through an analysis of costs, processes and margins, and, of course, to find a balance between the regulation of the agri-food sector and competition rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene.</p>
      <p sl="de">Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, congratulations on your re-election as Vice-President.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The distribution of value in the food supply chain is far from fair. Mr Bové’s report and the oral questions have touched on a sore spot. The primary producer is caught in the middle between highly concentrated suppliers of raw materials and powerful buyers. The primary producer cannot translate higher input costs into higher output prices. Primary producers remain a highly vulnerable group when it comes to distribution in the value chain and that is exactly why they need to forge a strong alliance, as Mr Ashworth said just now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Can the Commission clarify how much scope the legislation currently provides specifically for arrangements to recoup the cost of sustainability initiatives? How much scope is there for self-regulation? What measures does the Commission have in place for addressing the issue of buyers wielding an undesirable level of dominance?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Maria Patrão Neves for her excellent work. We welcome the general consensus reached on this text. The topic warranted it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For years, farmers’ share of revenue has been falling. As the statistics show, this decrease is not caused by one single entity, but by the producers’ lack of structural weight in the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of us have repeated this time and time again, but I do not know if that is good or bad. It has been said time and time again: we must give producers their deserved role in the food chain, one that is, above all, proportionate to their importance. The rules of competition should be applied in the same way to everyone and should not lead to this serious imbalance that we have highlighted. However, the reality is clearly very different. This unfair treatment is largely due to the diverse way in which the national competition authorities apply the European rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Members of the European Parliament, we see what is happening on the ground, we act as intermediaries and we can vouch for the difficulties encountered by many of our farmers or producers’ organisations when they want to unite in order to deal with processors, distributors and even their own competitors. As regards concentration, in particular, the definition of the relevant market varies from one country to another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When producers want to come together and combine their weight, some national competition authorities prevent them from doing so. They believe that the national market could not cope with that concentration and the significant weight of that new organisation. On the contrary, in other Member States, the opposite happens. Such groupings are authorised because the market taken into consideration, the supposedly relevant market, is the European market. Their weight is thus proportionally smaller and their position is not considered to be dominant. This situation is clearly untenable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission and the Court of Justice, as guardians of the Community’s legislation and its uniform application, must ensure that the national authorities do not keep producer organisations in an inferior position that puts a strain on their negotiating capacity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating José Bové on his excellent work, which clearly demonstrates the importance of keeping producers at the heart of the matter, for although we are well aware of the three stakeholders involved, namely, the producers, the large processing companies or small-scale processors, and the distributors, only the producers are suffering today. The two other large sectors are concentrated, highly concentrated in fact. That is the case for the distribution sector. Producers, however, are relatively deprived and very dispersed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore have to try to organise them as we have just done with the report on milk by Mr Nicholson. We tried to give them more power. I do not think that that is enough. In my view, there will be two important aspects. The first is that they will have to be organised but monitored by the public authority because – as one of my colleagues just said – we will need a body to monitor prices and margins as the public authority alone can ensure a balance between the various stakeholders. The second, in my opinion, is that we will have to stop treating competition as sacrosanct. What is important, above all, is the welfare of each of the stakeholders in the food chain, which ensures the welfare of all. That takes priority over the rules of competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is one of the great misconceptions of agriculture that higher food prices automatically translate into higher farm incomes. However, it is the experience of farmers in my own Member State, Ireland, that they are not getting fair play or a fair return in the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2010, average farm incomes in Ireland were EUR 17 700, or just over 50% of the average industrial wage. Since 2000, the cost of on-farm production has increased by over 37%, despite major efficiencies at farm level. At the same time, the price paid to farmers has increased by only 14%. I have no doubt that this imbalance is replicated for farmers right across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that primary producers are being squeezed from both sides of the food supply chain. On the one side, they receive low-grade farm gate prices due to the strong position of processors and retailers, and, on the other side, they pay high input prices due to increased concentration of input companies. Total input costs for EU farmers rose by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010 and costs continue to increase for farmers year on year. The upper pressure on these prices will rise further as a result of resource scarcity and a growing demand for food. On the other side of the chain, retailers have used their powers over farmers to implement a number of methods such as ‘hello money’, ‘pay to play money’, payment delays, shelf space pricing and carrying the costs of discount campaigns, which cut away at the returns of farmers and buy their produce in unfair and unbalanced conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about fair return for fair work, making a viable living from work that brings added value to the environment, delivers food security and puts food on the table of the European citizens. The retailers, processors, food suppliers and consumers are key stakeholders in the food supply chain, but so is the farmer. I think we should remember that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the rising cost of food is of great concern, particularly at this time of economic hardship.</p>
      <p sl="en">From an economic and monetary affairs perspective, we will deal in detail with the issue of commodity derivatives, and agricultural markets in general, in the regulation on markets in financial instruments and the Market Abuse Regulation over the course of this year. We need, however, to ensure that our financial services legislation is joined up with our wider agricultural policies. The key will be transparency. Ultimately, we do not know what role financial market participants are playing in the world’s commodity markets because there is a lack of transparency in the trading process.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report makes clear just how many factors influence the price of food, yet it is easy for politicians directly to blame banks and hedge funds for price volatility. This is not a two-dimensional discussion, and the Commission needs to look for more sophisticated tools to remove the opacity in commodity markets and give financial regulators a full toolbox. They really need to clamp down on any abusive behaviour as and when it may occur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, we need to proceed with caution, as food producers need to be able to continue to use agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge their business exposures. Financial participants should, however, reduce – not cause – volatility in our prices.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the extremely difficult situation facing agricultural producers puts the survival of many agricultural holdings at risk. Protecting the interests of farmers is therefore a matter which should be prioritised. We should focus, in particular, on small-scale family agricultural holdings as well as on holdings situated in Less Favoured Areas (LFA), especially mountainous or remote areas, where – due to the higher costs of production and energy used for transport or field work – the situation is particularly severe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we know, the current situation is influenced by an increase in the price of raw materials, energy, fertilisers and other means of production. We also need to consider, however, the exceptionally powerful monopolistic activities prevalent in the market for means of production, the processing market and in trade. Therefore, I share the opinion that this issue should be dealt with by European and national competition bodies. I also support the initiatives aimed at increasing the transparency of farm input prices, as well as the European Food Prices Monitoring Tool set up by Eurostat. What we need is a strong legal system that monitors and regulates similar practices.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The agricultural market requires a degree of intervention. Given the specific character of agricultural production, which depends on weather conditions and biology, full self-regulation of the agricultural market is not feasible. All the more so, since the agricultural market has been the subject of increased speculation, the results of which we have felt very strongly. We should also develop local markets, food fairs and other forms of trade, which will shorten the chain from food producers to food consumers. This will not only positively influence the quality of agricultural produce, but also contribute to reduced prices and increased benefits for consumers as well as for agricultural producers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, for many years, I have been taking part in debates devoted to the difficult situation facing European Union farmers. Unfortunately, it is with regret that I have to say that many of the European Commission’s announcements heard in the last few years, also in this House, have not been put into effect to this day. Farmers were promised a long time ago that they would have special agreements, which would guarantee continuous collection of produce on the one hand, and suitable prices on the other. Equally, relations with suppliers are deteriorating continuously. The plight of farmers is truly tragic. Their attempts to achieve specialisation and higher productivity resulted in their becoming dependent on suppliers in recent years, with the latter dictating prices as well as payment and delivery deadlines. We have to change this situation. We hear words to this effect time and time again. I would like to put the following question to the European Commission: when exactly can we expect proper regulation with regard to agreements and contracts, on the one hand, and with regard to relations between farmers and suppliers, on the other?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to focus on the energy aspects of Mr Bové’s excellent report because improving energy efficiency on our farms is an absolute imperative. I would caution, however, against the race for erecting massive wind turbines on farms. In Scotland right now, the modern equivalent of snake oil salesmen are knocking on doors throughout the countryside trying to persuade hard-pressed farmers to part with vast sums of cash in exchange for having one of these industrial monsters erected on their land with the promise of pots of gold.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as the recent storms have demonstrated, these turbines are often subject to catastrophic failure, and even when they are working, they only produce a trickle of electricity. As a result, many farmers in Scotland have found that they have rusting hulks on their land which are earning nothing and costing them a fortune. Instead of having signs on farm gates that say ‘Beware of the bull’, farmers should have signs on their gates which say ‘Beware of the bullshit’!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the cost pressure to which our agricultural producers are exposed is enormous. Agricultural inputs – meaning seeds, fertilisers and animal feed, but also machinery – are getting ever more expensive. One of the biggest factors behind the rising costs, however, is energy costs. There is an urgent need for an action plan in the energy sector, not only in order to get to grips with the costs, but also to reduce dependence, and this urgent need is a call to action for all areas of politics. There is a major potential in renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and biomass from sustainable raw materials. This renewable energy mix can fill the energy gap on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to mobilise all available resources, while at the same time increasing efficiency. Improved resource management in respect of humus and water, energy and nutrients cannot remain just an empty slogan.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another uncertainty factor for operators is the massive price fluctuations. Those running businesses need to be equipped to plan for the long term. A monitoring system for input prices could be helpful in that respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Excessive speculation on food commodities is an unacceptable factor. We cannot allow speculators to gamble on higher food prices. This problem is well enough known and it will not go away by itself. The effect of this can be felt by both agricultural producers, through low revenues, and consumers, through higher prices on the shop shelves. Higher food prices are not reflected in farming incomes. Instead, the beneficiaries are to be found at the end of the supply chain, which is to say, the processing industry and retailers. There needs to be a fair division of profits right along the production chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another cause of high costs that needs to be combated is Europe’s enormous dependence on supplies of raw materials and input products imported from third countries. We can only master the economic and environmental challenges and the extreme cost pressure in agriculture through long-term investment in raw material production, farm development, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">These approaches must also be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy. The new common agricultural policy must enable farmers to achieve the full potential of their businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces.</p>
      <p sl="de">I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis and the fall in consumption have dealt yet another blow to farms and producers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem of farmers’ incomes is becoming ever more severe and is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, the family-run businesses which do not have the strength to fight the arrogance of large retailers. Today, with this resolution, we are clearly saying that Europe must take action to correct these distortions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must ensure transparent contractual relations between producers and distributors in order to guarantee a decent, adequate income for those who work the soil. We must also prevent price fluctuations creating advantages for just a few, because currently, when prices rise, it is large retailers that profit, and when they fall, it is the farm workers that grow poorer. In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the industry becomes smaller and that there is fair competition within it.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not possible, as happens to me every Saturday, when I go shopping, to find extra virgin olive oil sold in the supermarket for EUR 2 per litre bottle when the price paid to producers by wholesale traders is EUR 2.35. Furthermore, we need transparency for consumers and clear information to guarantee quality against counterfeit products. Staying on the subject of extra virgin olive oil, we have asked, in a question that has received broad backing, for the level of alkyl esters and methyl esters to be reduced in order to prevent mixes of other oils, refined and deodorised, being added to oil sold as extra virgin. Placing these on the market contributes to driving down the price of high-quality oil.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I hope that in relation to these points and this request for an amendment to Regulation No 61/2011 to reduce the levels of alkyl esters and methyl esters, you will make a clear and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to reduce the presence of these counterfeit oils in extra virgin oil on the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we must ensure that production costs are driven down. I welcome your openness, but I call for the idea to be endorsed in the next CAP of ensuring that renewable energy generation facilities be installed in every farm. These would be intended to provide for the energy requirements of the farm itself, reducing costs and CO2 emissions, and providing support to producers and small farms. What could be greener than a provision like this?</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, we must act quickly and take appropriate measures, because rural abandonment and soil desertification are no longer risks that need to be averted, but actual facts that need to be combated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, if the proposals of the Bové report are implemented at the same speed as that at which Mr Silvestris made his speech, the future is bright.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will start by discussing food prices. Over recent days, we have talked and talked about how a third of food in Europe finds its way, unused, into the rubbish. We have been discussing our failure to achieve the biodiversity targets. We have been talking about how we find ourselves in an energy crisis. We have been talking about the fact that many Europeans cannot afford food at the moment. We have also been talking – and quite rightly so – about how those who produce food can no longer make a living by doing so and how we can talk of a large-scale abandonment of farming in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we have in its place is a concentration in production, in production facilities and, above all, in retail. If I take Austria as an example, we can see that 77% of the retail trade is in the hands of just three companies. What we do not want to see, on the other hand, is a concentration of this kind in agriculture. We want to retain the biodiversity here, too, in terms of types of business. We need these opportunities to produce healthy, safe, hygienically sound food.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are suggestions in the Bové report, and the reform of the common agricultural policy provides further opportunities. Let us effect implementation at the same speed that Mr Silvestris spoke to the House today!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I must mention the draft resolution being debated. In my view, the key elements in this draft are those which concern improving the farmers’ position in a better internal organisation. Providing support to producer organisations is the soundest way to enable producers to sell their produce under decent terms. At the same time, I do not believe that we need to be wary about legislating on the food supply chain relationship as long as future legislation is based on objective factors. It is not reasonable for us to continue to rely on self-regulation of this relationship between farmers and retailers, at least at the moment, as borne out by the experiences so far. Farmers need specific measures and cannot afford to idly wait to go bankrupt.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I am advocating the adoption of paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution in its entirety, which is extremely reasonable and even envisages that future legislative measures have to be adopted only if they are absolutely necessary, and that these measures must not distort the smooth operation of the markets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it was a year ago in September that Parliament adopted the Bové report, following an in-depth debate in which I, as the individual in charge of this matter for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, was heavily involved, promoting meetings and debates with European-, national- and regional-level retail, industrial and farming organisations. The report included an exhaustive series of recommendations to the European Commission with a view to a fair income for farmers and a better-functioning food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In fact, since 2008, the Commission and Parliament have been producing communications, reports and recommendations, and establishing high-level forums and groups to solve this serious problem, without anything having changed in practice beyond increased awareness.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is not the first time we have discussed the highly lop-sided distribution of power and margins in the food production chain. If we are honest, the European Commission has been insulting this Parliament for many years by ignoring our demands. Yes, there is a high-level group, yes, there have been reports, but there have been no concrete initiatives. I am therefore happy with the Commissioner’s minor undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, who is it that is suffering because of that lack of action? It is the primary producer. On that score, it is rather telling that we have the Commissioner for Industry here with us. I have heard him speak about industry, about processing and about the competition between companies. However, where does the greatest unfairness in the production chain lie? Right there, in the relationship between the farmer, the primary producer, and the rest of the chain. He has not said anything about that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And to Mr Agnew, who finds this debate so important that he has already left the room, and all his colleagues from the British Conservative Party, who put the interests of the City of London, with its warped financial products, above the producers of their daily bread, I will tell you how the market really works. When a Dutch tomato producer, during the EHEC crisis, is confronted with a price drop of more than 50% – not through any fault of his own, but just as the result of silly remarks made by a German Minister – he is happy that at least he has a contract with a supermarket for a fixed and agreed price. What happens in reality, however, is that this supermarket – which by the way is German – then returns his tomatoes because it knows that in this crisis, it can force the producer to agree to a lower price.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This, Commissioner, is the way the market works at the moment, and if you had done your job, this would not be possible in a European internal market. This House talks about fair trade with third world countries, but fair trade starts at home, with a fair price for European producers. That is your job, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we have been talking about the imbalances in the food chain for a long time. However, the situation has remained unchanged. Farmers continue to be the victims of illegal contracts and unfair competition. In my country, food producers need to pay a duty to be able to sell their products in supermarkets, not to mention an additional shelf charge to ensure their products a high profile in stores. In addition, farmers only receive a tiny percentage of the profits which the large stores make after selling this farm produce. In the overwhelming majority of cases, good-quality products from small and medium-sized farms find it very difficult to gain access to consumers as these producers cannot cope with the competition or the conditions imposed by supermarkets. In Romania, farmers are forced to throw away a good proportion of the fruit or vegetables they produce as they cannot gain any benefit from them under current market conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission and Member States to provide farmers with a stronger negotiating position in the food chain, ensure that the competition rules in agriculture are observed, and encourage local markets.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the state should only intervene in market relationships when self-regulation fails. This also applies in the food sector. The supply of food to the European market has serious deficiencies that affect not only farmers, but also consumers. We also see, however, that the food sector is reacting to it. The affected parties, from farms to traders, are in a dialogue with the objective of defining unfair business practices. All participants assert that it is wrong and unfair to demand instruments such as standard contracts, payment and supply conditions and even payments for listing a product. They become unfair when they are used to abuse their market position. The self-regulation process is a dialogue between all stakeholders. For it to produce a result, we need a certain amount of time. And when you say that we have been patient for long enough, I reply that restraint in the resolution …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unless we take action to curb the increases in farm input prices, we run the risk of making it too expensive for our farmers – especially our smaller farmers – to operate. We cannot afford to price our farmers out of the market. Any such reduction in agricultural holdings would simply increase our dependency on external markets. This would be negative for Europe both in terms of the value of agriculture to the EU and in terms of the quality and safety of the food available to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agri-food industry and distribution represent 7% of total employment within the EU, and are worth EUR 1 200 billion per year – more than any other manufacturing sector in the EU. There is the further problem that food produced in third countries may not be of the same quality, and may not adhere to the same standards and rigorous health and safety provisions, as food which is produced within the EU. Given the importance of the agri-food industry to Europe, it is therefore vital that we protect farmers and thoroughly examine the issue of increasing farm output prices.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, this is something that has actually been discussed on many an occasion during this parliamentary term. If we now look at the results, what has happened? Of course, it is good that the matter is discussed, but I do hope that we will now really be able to get to grips with this problem, perhaps in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is clear that in many countries of the European Union, trade is very centralised and that has contributed to the disparities in farmers’ income formation and also put them in a bad light in these price negotiations. We must strengthen the position of farmers in talks, but also ensure that they enjoy a more stable income arrangement as a result.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Bové’s report was also excellent. It is also evident that inputs have risen dramatically, and it should be possible for this to be reflected in prices. I hope that we will be able to address this issue in the context of the CAP reform.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if European farmers are to be competitive, even in their home markets, they must cut the cost of their inputs. Mr Bové was quite right to encourage farmers to cultivate their own seeds rather than relying on seed monopolies, and also to recycle phosphates and nitrogen rather than relying on ever more expensive purchases, and, of course, to return to the production of traditional products. He has also shown himself to be aware of the burden of the cost of complying with legislation – much of it, of course, EU legislation. He might have mentioned the costs of the new enriched poultry cages that have to be borne by countries complying with this very welcome legislation but not, of course, by those countries that have studiously ignored it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The gap between farm gate prices and the prices paid by consumers has been mentioned by other speakers. The power of oligopsonist supermarkets must be broken. They treat farmers as though they were medieval serfs put on earth to serve big business retailers.</p>

The stark reality is that inputs have risen by at least 40% and farm gate prices by probably, at the very most, 25%. This is not sustainable and it needs urgent action. Hopefully, it will come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, the monopolies have to be tackled. Mr Smith and others have outlined instances of extraordinary monopolies that definitely must be tackled. Secondly, there are opportunities with energy efficiency and other measures whereby farmers can help themselves, but as Mr Stevenson pointed out, they have to be practical and not by people who are selling products that will not make much difference in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my colleague was right: we need fair conditions between the market participants. It is precisely those fair conditions that we do not have. On the other hand, we do have a social market economy. In other words, politicians are obliged, where there is a will so to do, to intervene and regulate.</p>
      <p sl="de">To do so, however, we would need a form of language that the market would understand. Poor prices for farmers must mean, quite simply, that we offer less in return. Then we have the problem of imbalance. Agriculture is made up of small actors – many operators – while the processing industry consists of medium-sized enterprises and the retail sector is highly concentrated. Put simply, things cannot work like that.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we definitely need, in my view, is strong interest groups and trade associations for agriculture that could regulate the market. In addition, farmers need interest groups and market information. They must also be allowed to reach price agreements. Anti-trust law thus also needs to be amended in favour of our agricultural industry.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, agriculture is, and will remain, a strategic sector in the European Union’s economy. In order to tackle future challenges and ensure a degree of consistency with interventions carried out in a particular region, we must first of all establish close links between agricultural policy, rural development policy and regional policy. With regard to the uneven response by food prices to the fluctuations in commodity prices, I think that this is mainly linked to the number of intermediaries operating throughout the supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am therefore in favour of adopting instruments which will be used to promote and support short supply chains and markets where farmers can sell their own produce directly. This will help establish a direct link between consumers and farmers in a particular region, enabling the latter to obtain a greater share of the value of the final price, while the general public will benefit from lower prices.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, following my first very long speech and this very long debate, and since we have not yet heard from Mr Bové, my closing speech will be quite short.</p>
      <p sl="es">After this tribute to the President, I will speak in my language, Italian.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to make a few points concerning the issue of prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">Regarding unfair commercial practices, the Commission is seeking to promote a consensual approach between the parties, and let me say again that this approach corresponds to the principle of good legislation that we have already welcomed thanks to this Parliament’s work on the Corazza Bildt report. I believe that we achieved good concrete results in this area in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission and the high-level forum on the agri-food industry, as I have said, will need to analyse the possible instruments for applying the guidelines contained in the document that you will receive. The sector’s representatives have committed to participating in a further phase of dialogue to draw up a proposal by mid-2012. As I have said, the Commission will have to decide whether to continue with efforts to find a solution based on dialogue or to take action through legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, the dialogue needs to be completed swiftly, and cannot be postponed indefinitely. That is why, if there is no reasonableness or a genuine wish to conclude the dialogue, we will be forced to take action. There will be no option, even though I always prefer an agreement rather than to take action through legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Late payment is another essential measure. I have said how strong my commitment is to ensuring that the directive on late payments be adopted swiftly, before the deadline set, which is the end of March 2013. I would like to say again that I have written to all the EU ministers of industry. Let me remind you that the directive sets deadlines not only between public authorities and enterprises, but also between large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, unless there are agreements between the parties, provided that these agreements are not harmful to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that this directive, which forms an important part of the ‘Small Business Act’, can truly provide a response to the problems of small entrepreneurs in the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next, to respond to your question on the need to move forward with an appropriate analysis of food prices in the EU, with a view to monitoring compliance with transparency, I would like to remind you of the important work done by Eurostat, the Commission’s statistical service, on the European food prices monitoring tool. This tool is based on the vital cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical institutes within a specific working group in the high-level forum on the agri-food industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is also working together with the other international organisations working on similar issues, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, because of the diversity of Europe’s food markets and the complexity of the factors influencing the prices paid by consumers, a detailed Europe-wide analysis of prices and margins is not realistic.</p>
      <p sl="it">This needs to be accomplished at national level, as is already happening in some Member States. That is why, through the forum that I have set up, we are trying to develop synergies between national price monitoring bodies, exchanging ideas and proposals, for instance, on the methodologies used.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the issue of competition, which was at the heart of several speeches during the debate, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of markets based on raw materials, including agricultural commodities. Specifically, these proposals concern over-the-counter derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse, as I have said, and as you well know, these proposals are at the heart of the debate in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is one thing that I would like to ask Parliament. The proposals on derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse are currently at the codecision stage. I believe that this House could give a positive response and could play a role of great importance.</p>
      <p sl="it">I was speaking about competition. The Directorate-General is working closely with the national authorities within the European competition network. These authorities are able to examine and impose penalties on anti-competitive activities in their national markets and, during recent years, many national authorities have carried out thorough investigations in the agriculture and food sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">That has made it possible to adopt significant penalty measures, many of which have related to abuse affecting farmers. The Commission will, however, soon publish a report on this subject and the European Parliament will, of course, be informed of it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense.</p>

      <p sl="en">Agriculture is facing an ever more complex situation. While the purchase costs of agricultural inputs such as energy, machinery, feed mixtures, fertilisers, pesticides, seed or water are rising sharply, farmers’ profits are stagnating. Agricultural activities consume large amounts of energy. Farmers are trying to maximise energy savings by insulating agricultural buildings, using alternative energy sources and so on. In view of the strategic position of agriculture for Europe, producing safe food and providing independent sustenance for the European population, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to consider the options for setting maximum energy prices for primary agricultural production. The second financially burdensome input factor is the cost of fertilisers and soil improvers. There is room for improvement here on the part of farmers. Farmers have become accustomed to using large quantities of fertilisers. Restricting the massive use of chemicals will benefit soil ecosystems and help natural renewal. I would therefore like to urge greater use of natural fertilisers and the natural products that already exist in agriculture as by-products. I would also like to emphasise support for organic farming. The third fundamental problem for farmers is the rapidly rising cost of seed and planting stock. This worrying situation is caused by the massive purchasing of certified seed and the modest use of farm-saved seed. At the same time, farm-saved seed is economically advantageous and benefits the environment. I would like to call for the revision of all regulations restricting farmers in the use of their own seed.</p>

      <p sl="en">The widening gap between input and production costs and farm gate prices is not economically viable; for the younger generation, farming is not a viable option. Only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35 years old. We now have a world population of 7 billion; by 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion and by 2046, 9 billion! This means that a decreasing number of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed by 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue. We need to ensure that farming is a real career choice for our young people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ever increasing production and agricultural input costs in conjunction with only marginally increasing farm gate prices have resulted in a drop in income for farmers. Statistics explicitly point to the increase in the prices of animal feed, seeds, fertilisers and plant protection products. At this point, I would like to emphasise the significance of energy. According to Eurostat, the price of energy, including electricity, gas and fuel, has increased by approximately 60% over the last 10 years. The construction of biogas plants and infrastructure that use wind, solar and geothermal energy undoubtedly involves significant expense. However, in the long term, this expense is certainly beneficial, as it increases income and has a positive impact on environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Practices aimed at saving energy and increasing energy efficiency must be encouraged and implemented in all holdings at local levels, either individually or through cooperation between neighbouring farmers. Moreover, engaging in cooperation aimed at better resource management and good farming practices will increase the bargaining power and market stability of farmers, which will, in turn, translate directly into higher incomes. Collaboration with research centres, reduction in protein deficit, systems for monitoring land prices and access to land are, of course, the remaining challenges, which must be tackled by the future common agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Since the end of the 1990s, the price of foodstuffs has risen by an average of 3.3% per year, yet the price actually received by farmers has only risen by 2.1%. Add to this the increase in operating costs for farms, which average 3.6% per year. The imbalance is aggravated further by the speculation on agricultural commodities. This situation, which affects both farmers and consumers, cannot continue. We must protect both producers and consumers by ensuring that the large-scale distribution sector does not take the lion’s share. I voted in favour of this resolution because it is our duty to bring stability to the European food chain and, with that in mind, to ensure a balanced distribution of profits as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Aldo Patriciello, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens (2011/2148(INI)) (A7-0431/2011).</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, space has now become a pressing topic. This is demonstrated by the acute media interest in the launch of the first two Galileo satellites, which were launched on 21 October 2011 from the European base of Kourou, representing the first step in achieving European Union independence in satellite navigation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The achievement of this ambitious goal is, in large part, due to the impetus provided by Article 189 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which clearly and unequivocally gives the European Union responsibility for coordinating and consolidating national space policies and programmes through a joint approach in order to promote scientific and technical progress and industrial competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">This aim, laid down by the Treaty, recognises the importance of space and the services it generates for EU citizens in social, economic and strategic spheres, considering it essential to enable the European Union to compete on the world stage with its competitors. The treaty therefore provides an authoritative basis designed to achieve ambitious goals. The European institutions must allocate suitable resources and legislative instruments to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this point, I have had the honour of working over recent months within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on drawing up the draft report on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens. I hope that the final version of the text will accurately reflect the ambitious proposals that we have tried to include in the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I refer, above all, to the different way in which the two strategic programmes in European space policy, Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), have been treated. While firmly endorsing the emphasis that the Commission has thus far placed on Galileo, one of the pillars of European space policy, I believe that, in light of the investments made so far, amounting to as much as EUR 3.5 billion, and the strategic importance of the programme, GMES deserves equal treatment in both economic and strategic terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that only by developing both programmes in synergy will it be possible to ensure that our continent achieves technological and political independence, providing huge economic and social benefits to European citizens. That is why, in the report approved by the Committee on Industry, which we are to vote on shortly, I expressed my deep regret about the Commission’s decision not to include funding for GMES in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, in the knowledge that the lack of a financing plan providing economic support could mean that the significant investment made to date has been fruitless.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important aspect to clarify is the strategy that the Commission decides to adopt on the management aspects of the Galileo and GMES programmes with a view to streamlining the organisational structure and having a precise framework for maintenance costs.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have also attempted to highlight, in the report, the need for Europe to ensure that it is independent with regard to access to space, and for commercial agreements concluded with third countries to be based on completely reciprocal relations, avoiding dependence on suppliers outside Europe in relation to certain key technologies such as launchers. The latter, together with the creation of a European space situational awareness system and the strengthening of research, are key elements in an ambitious text which we hope will give the answers that European citizens are waiting for.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to be far-sighted, European space policy cannot ignore support for industry. At a time like the present, when there is a deep economic crisis, it seems more vital than ever for the EU to provide economic support to the space industry with a view to maintaining our continent’s competitiveness within an increasingly competitive global system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Only if we provide European industry with real, tangible prospects will we be able to demand that industry invest in human resources and complex long-term technologies. Only if European industry maintains its leadership in space know-how will our continent be able to remain a leader in this crucial sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">As rapporteur on European space policy, this is direction that I have attempted to take. I hope that a convincing vote by Parliament will give force to a text which, in line with Article 189 of the new Treaty, provides for scientific and technological development in a sector whose sustainable growth is essential for the EU.</p>

I should stress the importance of a research and innovation strategy for space policy, ensuring technological progress, industrial development and the EU’s competitiveness, and creating jobs across the EU. We call on the Commission to support small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining easier access to European funding earmarked for innovation in the area of GNSS applications and services, particularly based on the Framework Programmes of Research.

In view of the fact that services in the area of space are growing rapidly and that the Galileo system provides certain advantages compared to competing systems, it may be expected that it will bring corresponding social and economic benefits in the near future.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, I believe that space policy is a priority in my mandate as a Commissioner, both as regards the services that can be provided and which are already beginning to be provided to the EU’s citizens, and because I believe that the sector of industry and enterprises – since there are thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in this sector – is at the heart of what we call the third industrial revolution. What I mean by that is industrial policy of a kind that can enable Europe to focus its growth and development on the internal market and, therefore, the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Concrete results have been obtained. I thank Mr Patriciello for the work that he has done together with his fellow Members and I thank Parliament as a whole, as well as Mr Prodi, for his strong support for the Commission’s policy. We are in perfect harmony when we call for a truly competitive space policy for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I was saying, significant results have been achieved in recent months. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is beginning to be operational. In October, we launched Galileo’s first two operational satellites from Kourou in French Guiana. On the day of the launch itself, I started the procedure for the purchase of eight new satellites and, on 1 February, I will announce the results of the procurement procedure for the purchase of further Galileo satellites. So, this timescale and adherence to the forecasts have made it possible to save approximately EUR 500 million as compared with the forecasts made at the beginning of 2011 to the interinstitutional group and to this Parliament in the document on space policy that we presented.</p>
      <p sl="it">Galileo is progressing, and it is my intention to make Galileo’s services operational by the end of 2014 and to have the full system with 30 satellites, seeking to save as much money as possible and adhering to the deadline of the end of 2020.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, we provide for investments of approximately EUR 7 billion for the implementation of Galileo in the proposed financial forecasts that we have presented to Parliament and the Council. That is for implementation; approximately EUR 1 billion or so is for the launch of all the satellites and the rest is for maintenance and the full implementation of services, bearing in mind that the saving, once Galileo becomes operational, will be approximately EUR 90 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have also received Mr Patriciello’s message concerning Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The Commission has adopted a communication, has made a proposal, and we believe that GMES should go forward. However, we have proposed setting up an ad hoc financing fund outside the EU budget, but within the EU. This would be a special agreement between the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also addressed this issue at the most recent Space Council, and I have spoken about it to the Competitiveness Council. Why have we made this proposal? It is because we know the situation of the budget. The European Commission and Parliament wished to see more ambitious choices by the Member States concerning the budget but, unfortunately, the response was not what we were expecting or hoping for.</p>
      <p sl="it">The outcome reached unfortunately means that we cannot include all the actions that we want to implement between 2014 and 2020 within the EU’s budget. That is why, in addition to being convinced of the importance of GMES as part of a European space policy, GMES, let me remind you, also enables us to strengthen our international connections.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have been through the signing of some agreements with countries in Latin America regarding space policy. During the Belgian Presidency, we did a lot of work with the African Union and we are continuing to do so on space policy, on GMES, and on observation of the earth.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, as things stand, there are problems linked to the budget. That is the starting point for the Commission’s choice. I must say that we believe so much in European space policy that in the financial framework, we have decided, from the large package of EUR 80 billion earmarked for research and innovation, to invest a significant amount in research and development in the space sector. This is therefore an added value that we wish to give to space policy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need your support for this strategy and it seems to me that the speeches which followed Mr Patriciello’s report are indeed all supportive. I believe that cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission on space policy in the weeks, months and years ahead will continue to be strong and I believe that we will all be able to focus on the same objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of European space policy is to improve the daily lives of the European public, foster potential for innovation, support scientific progress and create qualified jobs. That is why it plays an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy. It is currently facing challenges: implementing the flagship policies, cooperating and competing internationally, and boosting the present economic importance of services provided in the field of radionavigation. To this end, it is important to make full use of the potential of EU territory and of investments already made.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, I should like to stress the usefulness of the satellite station on Santa Maria Island in the Azores, whose activities relate to monitoring the oceans and space missions, like Galileo. The EU should be aware of the Azores’ location in the middle of the Atlantic and how this can be best exploited, in particular, by giving them new importance. I would also highlight the usefulness of creating space clusters. These not only contribute to the EU objectives that I have mentioned, but also to promotion of the local economy through the recruitment of highly qualified personnel, or through the necessary partnerships with local business, as has been happening in the Azores. This is another opportunity for stimulating indicators of convergence with the EU, particularly in the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Space Programme, with the Galileo satellite navigation project at its head, has achieved some remarkable successes in the past year. The same applies to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme, which monitors climate change and security threats. Among the most significant successes are, above all, sending two satellites into space as part of the Galileo programme. At the same time, it is far from being just an expensive scientific whim. Both projects are of practical use in a range of areas, such as agriculture, transport, environmental protection and, of course, national security. What is more, the services linked to these programmes have enormous economic potential and create new jobs. The European space industry alone had a turnover of EUR 5.4 billion last year, employing 31 000 workers. The space programme, however, just like other research programmes, is threatened with budget cuts. In restricting these projects, the EU would surrender many opportunities for economic growth, particularly in the future, and I would therefore like to support adequate funding of the space programme in the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European space strategy must serve both the economy and basic research. That is why it is crucially important that, in addition to the grand implementation of flagship projects such as Galileo, we invest adequately in basic research as, beyond dispute, it is a major investment in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">From the point of view of Europe’s values and prestige, it is not appropriate to become a freeloader with regard to science. Space research is the privilege to discover the universe that mankind inhabits, and one that might even be regarded as his responsibility and, here, Europe must set an example. Obviously, however, the money invested in research must correlate with the added value that research brings to science. This being the case, the cost-effectiveness of projects should be borne in mind, in addition to which there needs to be agreement with other noteworthy agencies and actors on international collaboration and division of labour.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The importance, in terms of security policy, of an independent navigation satellite system cannot be exaggerated. It is vitally important for the border guard, the military, crisis management troops and disaster relief personnel to be in possession of the details of their position, regardless of the global policy situation. However, GPS cooperation with NATO and, in particular, the United States must continue in a positive spirit, with the options for a partial coordination of systems being kept open. Europe is excellently qualified for space research, having educated people, a launching site close to the equator, and a strong values base. It only lacks, as in many other respects, the courage and drive to hold the position it deserves in the global context.</p>

    <intervention id="4-093-000" speaker_id="4346" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Salvatore Caronna, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on how to avoid food wastage: strategies for a more efficient food chain in the EU (2011/2175(INI)) (A7-0430/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I should like to tell you, Mr Caronna, that this morning, the television news, in my country at least, was reporting extensively on the item that we are going to discuss today and I am sure that that was the case in other European countries as well. We are therefore dealing with a subject which has generated interest amongst the public, something that our debates rarely achieve.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-094-000" speaker_id="96866" name="Salvatore Caronna" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report.</p>
      <p sl="it">This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it.</p>
      <p sl="it">All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area.</p>
      <p sl="it">This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow food waste to increase any more, and we must combat it with special instruments, as well as through a culture designed to illustrate its economic, environmental and social effects.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last 30 years, food waste has grown by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related. It does not seem ethically sustainable that, in the face of the 70 million people, approximately, living in Europe under the poverty threshold, tonnes of food which is still edible are being thrown into the rubbish bin, or that the materials used for the production and packaging of this food are not being sorted as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">This waste, therefore, entails high economic and social costs. The proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cover spheres which, from packaging to more detailed information on the expiry date, are aimed at helping citizens to avoid waste and to reuse products.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Food security is a basic human right that is achieved through the availability, accessibility and temporal stability of healthy, sufficient, adequate and nutritious food. The issue of food waste should be addressed from the standpoint of resource efficiency. We call on the Commission to launch specific initiatives targeting food waste under the Resource-Efficient Europe initiative in order to ensure that the same attention is focused on this and that awareness is also raised about energy efficiency, since both are equally important for the environment and …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, food wastage is a very important problem and it is a good thing that the European Parliament is dealing with this issue, especially in the context of dramatic forecasts relating to food availability in the coming decades, and the enormous increase in demand for food. The wastage problem is closely related to what we have been discussing about an hour ago, namely, the trade concentration; the fact that the greater part of the food product trade is being taken over by large retail chains. This obviously results in increased food wastage, if only for the fact that, as a rule, more food is purchased in a supermarket than in a small local shop. Therefore, this matter is particularly important. While considering food wastage, we should not forget about land wastage. The food crisis also stems from the fact that ever increasing amounts of land are being excluded from agricultural production. This is a very dangerous process.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I consider the 90%, up to 115 kg, of food wasted per capita per year to be a sufficiently compelling reason for food waste to become a political priority. Continuing the present rate of waste in the agricultural food chain is not only unsustainable in the long term and irresponsible towards the poorest sections of the population, but also has negative effects on the environment and causes large losses for business and the economy. The rationalisation of production, storage, processing and subsequent distribution and consumption, in which the EU annually loses up to 50% of healthy, usable and edible food, therefore requires a comprehensive European strategy to be drawn up. Surely the 70 million Europeans who live below the poverty line …</p>

It seems to me that it would be an excellent idea to focus our attention on this issue and the year dedicated to it – we proposed 2014. This would be quite sensible. It is also an election year and it is a very practical issue that we can talk about with our citizens. This is not simply about the food we throw out at home: there is huge waste in this institution, I dare say, in hospitals, in public places and right through the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The debate in this Chamber this morning feeds into, if I can use that phrase, our earlier debate about the entire food supply chain. If we can reduce food waste, we will have a more efficient and more sustainable supply chain, which is vital.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the world population reached seven billion last year and it is expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050. Because of this, it is vital that we consider the issue of food security and of ensuring that we can produce enough food to feed our growing populations. In focusing on producing enough food for people, we must also look at how we use the food we produce and, to that end, we must also focus on food waste.</p>
      <p sl="en">Food waste happens at all points of the food chain – at the level of production, at the point of sale and at the point of consumption. However, the points at which food waste typically occurs differ depending on the country. In industrialised countries, most waste is concentrated at the final stages, in distribution and consumption.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ireland, it is estimated that up to a third of the food we buy ends up in the bin, potentially costing families more than EUR 1 000 per year. The website stopfoodwaste.ie was set up under the National Waste Prevention Programme to educate people about the issue and to promote awareness of measures to prevent food waste.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We should not forget that Europe is much more dependent on land beyond its borders for its food than any other region in the world, using 640 million hectares every year, which is equivalent to one and a half times the area of its own land. Almost 60% of the land used to meet Europe’s needs is actually located in other parts of the world, with an area 10 times bigger than Germany’s, for instance. This again raises the question about what we should do: do we use more land, look for more land elsewhere or use the available resources as efficiently as possible?</p>

      <p sl="it">How can the Commission contribute to combating waste? It can do so by precisely defining where the expenditure headings for this strategy are allocated. The issue of whether this should be focused within the organisation of social expenditure or should go back to the management and use of the Agriculture Directorate-General’s sector has remained unresolved.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, at a time of crisis and economising, the fact cannot be ignored that up to half of the food produced becomes waste before it reaches the consumer. I would like to thank the rapporteur for opening this topic on the floor of Parliament. Some of the blame for the current situation must be borne by legislation. The obligation of producers to state a best before date and expiry date results in 18% of food ending up as waste simply because people do not consider it to be safe. In some countries, the law does not permit the prices of products to be reduced below cost price, even on their expiry date. This must change. It is a pity that the report does not mention food banks. These non-profit organisations try to replace the wastage of food with its distribution to those who need it the most. We throw food into the bin while the European Union pays for food aid. Let us support the food banks instead.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, we currently throw away a quarter of the food that we take home in our shopping bags in Sweden. That is morally unacceptable and it is also unacceptable from the point of view of the environment and the economy. All of us can do something about this in our kitchens, our homes and when we buy food.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our role is to highlight the debate, raise awareness and disseminate accurate information. The Commission must provide clarification with regard to date labelling. The ‘best before’ date relates to quality, not safety. More labelling would instead confuse consumers. Lower temperatures in the supply chain for refrigerated foods would also increase durability. I have also been a driving force when it comes to getting the industry to take its share of the responsibility to a greater extent. They meet millions of people every day.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need to return to the farming culture that entails us using our common sense, being careful with our food and reusing leftovers. Instead, we currently live in a plastic culture. I hope that together, we will be able to change that. That is a challenge.</p>

Of course, I also want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caronna, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on the Internal Market for this report. I thank them, too, on behalf of Mr Cioloş, the Commissioner responsible for agricultural policy, who is in Dublin to present the common agricultural policy in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given its negative effects, especially for the environment and food safety, the issue of food waste is clearly receiving more and more attention. In this context, I must also mention the conference held in the European Parliament on 28 October 2010. What can we do at EU level? The Commission, which has already adopted a number of proposals, is currently drawing up additional proposals that will help to tackle the problem of food waste at various levels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have already mentioned the CAP reform, which focuses mainly on the production and processing stages of the food supply chain. The existing measures aimed at improving the sustainability of the agricultural sector, such as the agri-environmental measures, will be maintained. Additional measures will be introduced to respond to other recommendations in the report, such as the possibility of including in the rural development programmes thematic sub-programmes to support small holdings and promote the creation of short supply chains. The issue here is food miles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is also in the process of developing a European Innovation Partnership on agricultural productivity and sustainability, which aims to promote sustainable agriculture that obtains better results with fewer resources. The high-level fora looking at ways of improving the functioning of the food supply chain, which we discussed this morning, are also examining ways of optimising food packaging and minimising food waste as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission uses platforms such as the EU Retail Forum for Sustainability, the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Round Table and an informal network of Member States to examine the issue of environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, on 20 September, the Commission published a Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe, which aims to transform the European economy into a sustainable system by 2050. It states that food is one of the key sectors that could help us to achieve our goals in terms of efficient resource use. The road map thus lays down the ambitious target of halving edible food waste in the European Union by 2020 and reducing by 20% the food chain’s resource inputs by the same date. This issue appears in the report’s recommendations. The road map also calls for the preparation in 2013 of a communication on sustainable food in order to move this complex issue forward in a coherent and concrete manner. It recommends, too, that a methodology based on sustainability criteria be developed for key food commodities by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In paragraph 35 of your report, you ask the Commission and the Council to designate 2013 the ‘European Year against Food Waste’. My colleague, Commissioner Dalli, has examined this idea with your rapporteur because everyone is generally in agreement that we have to do something to combat food waste throughout the food chain. However, 2013 is too soon, firstly because in August, the Commission proposed designating 2013 the ‘European Year of Citizens’, and secondly because we need roughly two years to prepare fully all aspects of a European Year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we focus on 2014, which is what I took from this debate, it might be possible. I will forward your request to Mr Cioloş and Mr Dalli because I think that we could work together towards that goal.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report identifies the negative impact that food wastage has on the general population and, in particular, on people living near or below the poverty line. Food wastage occurs at each of the different stages of the food chain – most notably at the final stages of distribution and consumption. A change in practice, management and conduct at the various stages could both make industry more responsible and citizens more aware of this significant problem. We need a long-term action plan which will improve the entire supply chain and will focus on the ethical, economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health implications of food wastage in Europe and worldwide. Action needs to be taken at both national and European level to develop policies which will reduce waste while also improving food production practices in developing countries. The EU needs to address this salient issue in a spirit of cooperation, coordination and through the exchange of policy expertise to enable Europe to use food sustainably – from the moment of production to that of consumption.</p>

On the other hand, there are several billion people worldwide who make a living in the same way that countless past generations of their ancestors did, through primitive agriculture, with many of them routinely living on the brink of starvation. The world is full of irrational approaches, including the predominance of neoliberal economic schemes promoted by the most powerful countries in the world, but, at the same time, the world has a major problem with maintaining and improving the state of rural areas. The liquidation of food surpluses on the one hand, the effort towards at least slightly socially desirable steps, such as the programmes on consumption of fruit and milk products in schools, and, on the other hand, the possibility of making use – albeit not very rational use – of some types of plants for producing energy inputs shows that even a society as advanced as the EU has no recipe for solving these serious issues at present. Perhaps only a radical systemic change to the economic system across a major part of the world would bring a real solution. As this is not a realistic demand, we will at least support the declaration of 2013 as the European Year against Food Waste.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The world population is growing, resources are limited, and the poorest groups have inadequate access to food. On the other hand, perfectly usable food is being discarded all over the world: from losses during harvesting or storage, via transportation under conditions that are not particularly safe and errors during packaging, to the bad habits of consumers in the purchase and use of food products.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the last 40 years, global food waste has increased by 50%.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The production of food that we do not eat results in high costs from energy and natural resources, especially water, and greenhouse gas emissions. The approximately 89 million tonnes of food thrown away in Europe produces 170 million tonnes of CO2 per year. Apart from the environmental damage caused by food production, the costs of processing and disposing of the waste should be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Combating food waste must become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda. The Commission, Council and Member States must adopt specific measures aimed at halving the wastage of food by 2025.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must inform citizens not only of the causes and effects of waste, but also about ways of reducing it.</p>

      <p sl="it">A study commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reveals that 1.3 billion tonnes of food for human consumption are wasted every year.</p>
      <p sl="it">The study also shows that industrialised countries and developing countries waste approximately the same amount of food, 670 and 630 million tonnes respectively. Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes). Fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates.</p>
      <p sl="it">The amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world’s annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). Education in schools and political initiatives are possible starting points for changing this behaviour, and could go so far as to also promote, together with other policies, the fight against metabolic diseases based on food.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is needed is a collective realisation that reduces the commercial value of the appearance and quantity of food, bringing it closer to the real needs of each consumer. This is a difficult challenge, but the European Union can manage it, as it has succeeded in the past with policies with a very strong social impact, such as the ban on smoking in public places.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I am delighted that we in the EU are at last focusing more attention on a crucial area of food policy, which is to say, food wastage. The report before us summarises well the main problems relating to the issue. This is not just an ethical challenge: food wastage has obvious links to reforms in the agricultural sector, social justice and the issue of hunger. It goes without saying that it is a totally absurd situation where 30-50% of food, depending on the estimate, ends up as waste. Moreover, more and more often, it is waste that is not used in any way.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The proposal in the report now before us that we should halve food waste by 2025 is extremely important, and I give it my full support. However, while we are pondering ways to reduce both waste at different stages of production and consumer waste, we must bear in mind the bigger picture. Agricultural policy is food policy. When this report is adopted, I hope that together we can start to think about how we will judge overall what sort of food policy we are promoting, and what sort of follow-up mechanisms to employ. Cutting food waste will be central to this task. The report’s proposal that 2013 should be declared the European Year against Food Waste would provide us with an excellent opportunity to engage with a more sustainable food policy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">According to the Stockholm International Water Institute, almost half of the global harvest is lost ‘between the field and the fork’. The setting of concrete targets and the mandatory collection of food waste in households and catering outlets is, in my opinion, key to ending this waste. This requires the collection of sufficient data on the amount of waste produced in individual Member States, so that an effective statistical comparison can then be drawn. The Commission must not delay with new legislative proposals and must start collecting the necessary data as quickly as possible. Up to 50% of edible and safe food is thrown out in European households, supermarkets and restaurants every year, while 79 million EU citizens live below the poverty line and 16 million are dependent on food aid from charities. According to studies published by the Commission, food waste will increase by 40% by 2020, unless effective steps are taken. The fact that we fail to consume more than one third of the food we cultivate is a problem not just from an ethical perspective, but also from an environmental perspective. Every tonne of food waste represents the equivalent of 4.5 tonnes of CO2, the unnecessary consumption of water and energy, and the unnecessary use of agricultural land. If we planted trees everywhere where the crops that are never consumed are now cultivated, we would theoretically remove 100% of greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to welcome Mr Caronna’s report against a background of increasingly heated debate about food security and sustainable agriculture. On a global scale, enough food is produced to meet food requirements. However, the problem lies in its unequal distribution and wastage. While people are dying of hunger in Africa, according to an FAO study in Europe, Europeans and North Americans waste between 95 and 115 kg of food per capita every year. I wish to take this opportunity to call on the Commission to promote public awareness campaigns about food wastage, and I urge both farmers and economic operators to take measures to prevent the wastage of agricultural produce in both the field and food chain.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Food wastage has reached such high levels that it may soon be recognised as a worldwide problem. Since the 1970s, it has increased by over 50% globally. Food is being wasted everywhere: from harvest time in the fields, throughout the processing industry and, finally and most significantly, in consumers’ homes. Europe and North America are the undisputed front-runners in this shameful competition. Annually, the inhabitants of these two continents waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. Within the European Union itself, this indicator is even higher. According to the European Commission’s statistical data, Europeans throw out 179 kilograms of food per capita, which annually amounts to approximately 89 million tonnes of permanently wasted food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Contrary to popular belief, it is not overproduction that is the main cause of food wastage and – in the longer term – of hunger, but inadequate stock management and inappropriate marketing strategies aimed exclusively at maximising profit. It would appear however, that the factor that contributes most to the increase in waste is the placement of only one expiry date on labels, namely, the ‘best before’ date. Producers should be encouraged to place two pieces of information on labels. In other words, they should add a ‘use by’ date. The term ‘best before’ refers to the quality of the product, while the term ‘use by’ refers to its safety. This will help consumers make informed choices and, most importantly, prevent them from discarding food which is still edible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Food waste is getting worse every year, while raw materials are becoming scarcer and malnutrition is spreading throughout Europe. Some 89 million tonnes of food are disposed of each year (179 kg/year/person), yet most of it is safe and edible. I think we need to examine the causes of waste in order to reduce this phenomenon. We need to raise public awareness though European and national campaigns and, more specifically, teach children about this issue in schools. A double expiry date, with separate ‘sell by’ and ‘use by’ dates, would, for example, prevent food from being wasted. Use of this double label must, however, be accompanied by information for the customers, who must understand what it means. In my opinion, the European Union should promote a spirit of solidarity in the catering and large-scale distribution sectors to encourage them to redistribute free of charge to food banks or disadvantaged persons any unsold food that is still edible. If we do not react urgently to this situation, the people of Europe will not understand!</p>

At a time of crisis therefore, the Union is now moving back by a few years and a few kilometres.

In my view, the most important thing at this stage would have been to establish a programme for achieving this, and, furthermore, there ought to have been more focus on growth and maintaining employment.

If Europe is to overcome the crisis successfully, the Member States must regain the trust of the financial markets. The only real way of regaining trust is to take responsibility. Seeking other means, such as borrowing money for ineffective national and European projects, is the type of thinking that led us into the crisis. It is a road to new public debts, a road to hell.

      <p sl="en">It seems that if we are not going to be part of this new Treaty on Fiscal Union, this new FU Treaty, then it is logical that this should become the main forum for further integration.

As a result, electrical hardware often becomes obsolete after a comparatively short shelf-life and needs discarding.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report makes out that only a third of such hardware is disposed of in the prescribed manner and recycled. This disposal figure needs to increase and Parliament must continue to support the Commission’s 2020 target of 65%, with an interim target of 45%. I particularly welcome the proposal for retailers to provide collection points for redundant small portable equipment – objects such as our mobile phones. The effect of the poisonous pollutants emanating from the avoidable, incorrect disposal of electronic goods does not respect national boundaries. We owe it to our citizens to have a clean environment throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>

Another positive aspect is the emphasis on retrieving strategic raw materials, in addition to the recovery, recycling and reuse activities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasise the importance of the measures for raising the awareness of and informing the public. This will ensure the success of the waste management schemes. At the same time, I encourage the Commission to promote the exchange of good practices in this area. For example, the Romanian authorities have created a website offering complete information about collecting and recycling electrical and electronic equipment. Another measure was the launch of the national ‘Marea debarasare’ (Big Disposal) campaign in 2007. As a result of this annual event, several thousand tonnes of waste have been collected.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, waste electrical equipment is one of the fastest growing waste products in the European Union. We must do everything in our power to ensure that it is recycled professionally in order to be able to mitigate our loss of resources. In the interest of preventing environmental and health damage, we must seek to ensure appropriate collection. Impact assessments reveal that although 85% of these waste products are now collected in EU Member States, only 33% of them undergo appropriate processing. By preserving existing and tested systems, all actors involved in collection and treatment must engage in conduct that complies with the directive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Experience so far has unfortunately shown that Member States differ in their interpretations of the present directive. We must strive to ensure that the new Member States, too, are able to catch up and follow the provisions of the directive. This also includes selective waste collection. Selective collection could also serve to reduce the extensive illegal transport of waste outside the EU. I believe that costs incurred during collection and treatment should be incorporated into product prices so as to serve as an incentive to reduce costs. I, too, voted in favour of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report on waste electrical and electronic equipment seems to strike the right balance in terms of what should be decided at EU level and what should be left to Member States. For Wales, a key element will be the way in which the collection target will be calculated – the current method being kept until the end of 2013, after which there will be an interim target and then an ambitious target of 65% of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market from 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States such as my own will now have the choice of opting for a more ambitious 85% target should they wish to do so. Conversely, I welcome the proposal that the Commission will assist those Member States who are struggling to meet the targets, with transitional adjustments. While it is important to increase the amount of EEE being recycled and to reduce the waste, it is equally important that the approach should not be too prescriptive but should give Member States the flexibility to choose the most appropriate and achievable target for them. Delivering a positive result will now be up to the Member States: it will be up to them to demonstrate commitment turned into reality.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the Klass report concerning the placing on the market and the use of biocidal products. I believe that the package will be a balanced one, and it will see the Biocidal Products Directive repealed, hopefully, and replaced with a better alternative, while still keeping at the forefront its two main aims. In addition, with the retention of the two-step Biocidal Products Directive, the procedure particularly of assessing chemical active ingredients and the approval system that differentiates between the so-called ‘normal’ and ‘problematic’ substances will still remain in force. This is essential for the legislation to be effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the labelling requirements introduced by the compromise package for those materials treated with biocides and the simplification of data protection rules to be positive steps. The mandatory data sharing mechanism is also important and has been put forward in the report. This would mean the avoidance of duplication of vertebrate animal studies and the use of more vivisection which, generally speaking, I reject. I feel that the report will make the rules surrounding the products a lot easier to understand and also to enforce throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the centralised authorisation system will have a beneficial impact at European level. In addition, the measures on the comprehensive labelling of products treated with biocides are timely. They will enable consumers to be better informed and protected.</p>

The result of that is that foreign manufacturers, too, will have to meet high European standards if they want to sell their products in Europe. From the point of view of the agricultural sector, however, it is important that biocides continue to be available for use by our farmers.</p>

This report balances usage requirements whilst upholding a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment. It is important that the process of assessing the active ingredient and the subsequent authorisation of a biocidal product will be maintained at current standards to ensure the highest level of protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming from a background of biochemistry, I welcome that there will be a regular review of biocides, with the initial approval or subsequent renewals having a limit of 10 years. However, despite the report initially proposing a ban on all carcinogens, it is important that they will still be permitted to be used in a controlled manner particularly with regard to rodent control pesticides, which are widely used by the farming community in my region in Wales. Safe, regulated use is far preferable to an outright ban. I also support the rules for mutual recognition which will, of course, provide for a single market in biocides across the whole of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">We need fair conditions between all market participants. That is, of course, why we have a social market economy. A social market economy means that politicians need to get involved when these fair market conditions are not in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">One problem that we have in the agricultural sector is that we have a large number of farms and a processing industry made up mainly of medium-sized companies, whereas the retail sector at the end of the chain is highly concentrated into the hands of a small number of operators. The result of this, of course, is that it is the farmers, as the least organised of these sectors, who most often draw the short straw. As a result, we need a great increase in the number of interest groups to obtain market information and to be able to come to agreements about prices.

Therefore, exchanging methods of best practice is important, as is better coordination between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the most important matters highlighted by the report is the fact that the rules concerning below-cost selling in our supermarkets are not the same throughout the European Union. It is important to allow retailers to sell food at discounted prices as it nears its ‘sell by’ date: this practice reduces food wastage significantly in countries such as the United Kingdom, where it is permitted. In some of our Member States, believe it or not, there is a ban on below-cost selling – absurdly making this sensible practice illegal.

It will principally be of use to third-country nationals, who will henceforth be exempted from the ATV requirement if they hold a visa from a Member State of the European Union, even from a country which is not part of the Schengen zone.

      <p sl="fr">Since its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2000, Georgia has consistently taken steps towards the European Union. This agreement, aimed at mutually protecting geographical indications, is further proof of Georgia’s desire to extend its trade ties with us. Georgia has already been a party to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Therefore, it recognises the notion of GIs as place names used to identify the origin and quality, reputation or other characteristics of products. This agreement concerns agricultural products and foodstuffs originating in the territories of both Georgia and the EU, and endorses the protection of the characteristics of quality and origin of products coming from both partners. I can only support this initiative, which diversifies the European Union’s trade relations while protecting our producers.</p>

Under this agreement, both parties fulfilled a commitment provided for in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force on 1 July 1999, and its implementation was made possible by Georgia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2000. This agreement will be mutually beneficial. On the EU side, it should help ensure that around 820 food GIs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits (from 23 Member States) registered by the EU will be protected in Georgia, which is very reassuring for EU agricultural production.

The agreement will enable a great many European products to be protected in Georgia, in exchange for the protection of a few Georgian products in the Member States. Accordingly, I cannot but approve of the text that has been negotiated, even though Georgia is not actually a problematic area in terms of the recognition of GIs in the agricultural and food sector. The areas that pose legislative and political obstacles to the progress of bilateral negotiations for the mutual protection and recognition of GIs are other ones entirely. This agreement ought therefore to be welcomed, but the hope is that this is only the first of a number of similar agreements to be negotiated, as soon as possible, with subjects that compete unfairly with European products on a serious and very substantial scale.

Although Georgia only joined the World Trade Organisation in 2000, there has been a partnership and cooperation agreement between it and the EU since 1 July 1999. Following time-honoured traditions, the purpose of GIs is to identify the origin, quality and characteristics of given products, linking them to the region where they are produced, so as to guarantee their reputation. I voted for this draft recommendation because I believe that both Georgia and the EU, particularly their farmers, will benefit greatly, since they will see the characteristics of their products – cheeses, oils and fats, bread and pastry, fruit, vegetables, cereals, fresh meats and meat products, fresh fish and seafood, wines, spirits and beers – recognised and protected.

      <p sl="pt">Geographical indications (GIs) constitute an instrument intended to protect certain names that identify products with a special link to their region of origin. GIs are indications that identify a product as originating in a given territory, in which a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product can essentially be attributed to its geographic origin. In the current international context, marked by deregulation and liberalisation of world trade, by standardisation of production methods, by intensification and homogenisation of production, by the consequent loss of modes of production and traditional products, and by reductions in all types of biodiversity, GIs constitute an instrument that can help preserve and respect the characteristics and quality of certain local and regional products. We support the establishment of GIs for various agricultural products, such as cheeses, fruit, vegetables, cereals, meats, fish and seafood, bread and pastry, and wines and spirits originating in 23 EU countries and in Georgia. However, it should be remembered that this instrument is not a panacea for tackling the damage caused by trade deregulation. What is necessary, then, is calling into question the dogma of free trade. Regrettably, the rapporteur calls – in the same report – for the door to be opened to this.</p>

Georgia is a country of rich tradition, especially in terms of its cuisine and wine. The abundance of crops, local dishes and wines is beyond compare. As honest trade partners, we should therefore help Georgians to protect their unique produce, while at the same time promoting its high quality. Georgia’s wines are worthy of particular note.

As such, the EU-Georgia agreement – the first of this type concluded with a European Neighbourhood Policy partner – represents a natural step in the context of deepening relations with that country. From the EU perspective, the agreement will protect the geographical indications of around 820 foodstuffs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits; from the Georgian side, it will protect the geographical indicators of around 18 wines. However, it should be noted that the wine market accounts for a significant proportion of Georgia’s economy. The proportion of the country’s agricultural exports going to the EU increased from 10% in 1997 to 40% in 2007. I voted in favour, in the hope that the agreement will create closer ties between the EU and Georgia.</p>

This agreement is a step taken by both partners as foreseen in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 July 1999.

The UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations is a standing working group that operates within the United Nations and concerns itself with the regulations applicable to motor vehicles.

Indeed many third-world countries have introduced LEDs into their traffic control systems. It is strange that most European countries have not done the same. The only argument being put forward is that, during a time of austerity, this is not the right time for capital expenditure. I do not agree for three reasons. In the long term, this is cost effective. Firstly, LEDs are energy savers reducing the cost of energy. Secondly, if they help to reduce pedestrian injuries, they reduce the very high costs of hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Thirdly, if they help to prevent death, then the investment in that particular human (i.e. education) will not be lost. But the most important reason is that all human life is sacred and must be protected at all costs.</p>

I agree on the goal set out at the United Nations Economic Commission meeting in Geneva and hence my vote on the draft Council decision is in favour.</p>

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is one of these. Initially established as a regional organisation of the UN, it is now open to all countries of the world, as well as to professional organisations, NGOs and regional organisations, and today includes more than 70. The UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) debates and approves the global harmonisation of these regulations, particularly for countries that produce motor vehicles. It seems clear to me that there is an economy of scale for our EU in considering these regulations/type-approvals at global level, taking into account not just the interests of producers, but also the safety of users and the general public. This is mainly because, for example, UNECE approvals are considered EU approvals, meaning that it cuts red tape, but it is also because, objectively, it raises the bar in terms of the requirements relating to the quality, safety, environmental protection, reliability, etc. of all products manufactured. As such, I applaud the work of the UNECE in general, particularly the work of the WP.29 and, specifically, this draft regulation relating to light emitting diode light sources.</p>

Moves to ‘avoid discrimination between EU air carriers’ with the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating monopolistic concentration within the sector, which is already under way. The reference to the primacy of free competition in Article 4 comes under this heading, seeking to reduce the Member States’ ability to defend their flag carriers, in a sector that is strategic in terms of safeguarding national interests for a number of reasons.

However, some years ago, the Commission sought to launch negotiations for the accession of the EU, hoping for an amendment to the ICAO’s rules.

In essence, this agreement seems to be a Trojan horse that will allow the Commission to get around international law, and, what is more, at the expense of the EU Member States which, by contrast, are legal and fully-fledged members of the ICAO. Despite this, they could gradually lose their ability to exercise their rights within the ICAO if this memorandum were to enter into force.

The overall goal of the MOC is to ensure greater harmonisation of standards and closer coordination of respective activities. Thus far, provisions have only been laid down in relation to aviation safety. The parties agree to cooperate closely and to coordinate their safety activities. The approach is based on the mutual commitment to achieve the highest levels of aviation safety worldwide and a global harmonisation of safety standards and recommended practices (SARPs). The identification of unsafe areas and carriers is a common fundamental interest and an important part of shared activities. I believe that Parliament should contribute to strengthening the EU’s position within the ICAO, and it is therefore right that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has given its consent to the conclusion of the Memorandum of Cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which would provide a framework for enhanced cooperation.</p>

This directive also seeks to improve the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of electrical and electronic equipment, such as producers, distributors and consumers, particularly those operators directly involved in the collection and treatment of WEEE. Different national applications of the producer responsibility principle lead to substantial disparities in the financial burden on economic operators, and having different national policies on the management of WEEE hampers the effectiveness of recycling policies.

This directive is positive for European consumers, who will, from now on, be able to return their small appliances to retailers and businesses with no obligation to purchase a new product.

The revision therefore aims to eliminate the excessive and unnecessary bureaucratic burden, entailing technical, legal and administrative problems, which leads to costs for market participants and the Member States, to ongoing environmental harm, to less innovation in waste collection and treatment, to the absence of a level playing field, and even to the distortion of competition. I should like to highlight the most important of the objectives listed in the report: specifically, that of reducing costs by eliminating all unnecessary red tape, without affecting environmental safety; that of additional efforts towards making the WEEE Directive more effective and applicable by increasing the rate of compliance and reducing free-loading; and, finally, that of reducing the impact of the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE products on the environment, in order to maximise their net benefit for society.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The market for electrical and electronic equipment has grown exponentially over recent decades, particularly for mobile phones, computers and televisions, owing to technological innovation and very aggressive advertising campaigns. This has led to an increase in the tonnes of waste from these products, which are left in open-air dumps or illegally exported. Apart from the environmental problems that this causes, putting human health at risk, this situation constitutes an enormous waste of materials, including precious metals such as gold, platinum and silver, which could help global economic recovery and reduce the extraction of natural resources. This recommendation for second reading, drafted by Mr Florenz, concerns the Council position at first reading on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on this waste. It is imperative to proceed towards the implementation of measures that encourage selective collection, recycling and/or recovery of these materials, so I voted for this report. I hope that the new directive will be applied as swiftly as possible, and that it will thereby contribute to improving public health and preventing the illegal export of waste electrical and electronic equipment to countries that do not have environmental controls.</p>

The reality is that waste flows have been growing within the EU, and that it is therefore necessary to take measures aimed at the collection and treatment of waste, with a view to increasing recycling and reuse, especially in relation to secondary raw materials. The scope of the directive extends to all electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), unless explicitly excluded. New definitions have been added to enhance legal certainty and consistency with other EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of its targets, within four years, the Member States should achieve a collection rate of 45% of WEEE, taking account of the EEE that has been placed on the market in the last three years.

      <p sl="sk">Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was adopted on 27 January 2003 and entered into force on 13 February 2003. Member States were required to transpose the requirements of the directive by 13 August 2004. Neither the drivers nor the rationale for collecting and recycling WEEE have changed since the adoption of the directive. Experience with the first years of implementation of the WEEE Directive has indicated technical, legal and administrative problems that result in unintentionally costly efforts from market actors and administrations, continuing environmental harm, low levels of innovation in waste collection and treatment, a lack of a level playing field or even distortion of competition, as well as unnecessary administrative burdens. The Commission is committed to developing a better regulatory environment, one that is simple, understandable, effective and enforceable. The specific objectives of the review of the WEEE Directive are therefore the following areas: reduced administrative costs without lowering the level of environmental protection; implementation of the directive through increased compliance and reduced free-riding; reduced impacts on the environment from the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE at the levels where the greatest net benefit to society results. If the necessary measures had not been adopted, the problems and disparities in this area would continue. This was one of the reasons that the directive in question was amended accordingly.</p>

It is in this context that I voted for the compromise obtained after many years of negotiations, which sets a waste recovery target of 85% in 2019. As a result, despite opposition from some companies, which complain that a heavy burden is being placed on them, it is expected that the major distributors will have to set up collection points for used telephones and small appliances to encourage consumers to recycle. A new obligation will also be established to prevent European companies from sending potentially dangerous goods outside the EU. Finally, the recycling of precious metals, such as gold, silver and rare earth metals contained in these used products, which will reduce our dependence on external sources for these materials, is another advantage.</p>

As I said during the previous WEEE debate, this is exactly how we can ensure that product design is environmentally friendly, and thus guarantee the feasibility of the whole directive. When producers know that they will eventually have to pay for the final phases of the equipment, costs are minimised beforehand, and they will ensure that as little waste as possible is generated and that this small amount is as recyclable as possible. In this way, the entire chain of producers, importers, traders, consumers, waste management operatives and recycling centres, as well as the authorities, are all accountable, just as they should be.</p>

Around 700 000 tonnes of electrical waste was generated in 2010 in Germany alone; 155 000 tonnes of this is illegally shipped to countries such as Ghana every year. Either disposal companies that have already been paid by the device manufacturers to recycle the waste flog it off to dealers, or citizens are enticed to buy the equipment for a couple of euro from the gates of municipal recycling facilities. The new directive on electrical waste is intended to provide the authorities with a legally binding basis that allows them to define quite clearly what is waste and what is a used product. When fridges or mobile phones are taken out of use, expensive raw materials such as gold, copper or silver should be reused in Europe. Moreover, proper reuse would reduce the amount of electrical waste that poisons people and the environment. The directive has noble aims, but it remains to be seen what impact it has in practice. If dealers are no longer allowed to take back old equipment, then it is to be feared that a lot of electrical waste will be dumped illegally. For this reason, I voted against the report.</p>

Finally, I believe that convenient facilities should be set up for the return of WEEE, including public collection points, where private households will be able to make a positive contribution by delivering their waste.

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of Parliament’s position on the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) because the directive supports the efficient use of resources and recovery of valuable secondary raw materials. Member States encourage cooperation between producers and recyclers and the adoption of measures to promote the design and production of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), particularly with a view to facilitating reuse, dismantling and recovery of WEEE, its components and materials. In the case of WEEE from private households, Member States are creating systems allowing this waste to be returned free of charge. Some Member States, including Romania, may, due to the lack of required infrastructure and the low level of EEE consumption, decide to achieve, within four years of the directive’s entry into force, a collection rate of between 40 and 45% of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years, and postpone the achievement of the final collection rate mentioned in Article 7(1) until a future date which must not be later than nine years after the directive’s entry into force. The Commission calls on the European standardisation organisations to develop European standards for the treatment, recovery, recycling and preparation for reuse of WEEE.</p>

This directive, although in itself insufficient, is a step in the right direction as regards the aim of bringing about an environmental transformation in our society. It is based on three decisions: producing sustainable equipment, fully reusing materials from end-of-life products, and involving local actors in this recycling process. It is also necessary for this directive to be properly implemented on the basis of specific criteria, such as the ‘creation of convenient facilities, including public collection points, where private households should be able to return their waste at least free of charge’; the implementation by Member States of an 85% minimum collection rate for WEEE; the free provision of information by producers about preparation for re-use and treatment of each type of new EEE placed on the market within one year of the equipment being placed on the market.

For many of our enterprises – and this is particularly true in my home region of Saxony, one of Europe’s leading centres of research and high technology – these raw materials are therefore indispensable. The extraction of metals from electrical and electronic waste has therefore become an important topic again. Considerable potential exists in electrical equipment such as computers and mobile phones. In Germany, we are already very good at recycling compared with many other Member States, but even here, many important raw materials are lost in electrical waste – whether legally or illegally. That is not just ecologically and socially questionable; it is also increasingly an economic problem. To me, therefore, extracting and retrieving raw materials as effectively as possible while ensuring an end to the illegal shipping of electrical waste to developing countries, where it poisons people, is one of the most important achievements of this directive. In future, then, it is the contractor and not the customs authorities that must prove in controls that the equipment is serviceable and is not electrical waste, so that we can stem the tide of illegal exports.

      <p sl="sk">I supported the draft of the submitted directive, although sometimes, I feel that we are going about it in the wrong way. We are spending most of our time and energy dealing with the consequences. We see a huge amount of electrical and electronic waste that is, in many cases, highly toxic; we also see that further raw materials are needed for the manufacture of new electronic appliances. We think it fair that the costs of collection and treatment of electrical and electronic waste should be borne by the manufacturer and, ultimately, the purchaser of the product. The submitted draft draws on these considerations. The real problem, however, is the service life of electrical and electronic equipment. Introducing a mandatory minimum warranty period of two years looks like a significant step towards higher quality, until we realise that most manufacturers understand the word ‘minimum’ to mean the threshold beyond which it does not pay to continue because costs would increase. I therefore think that until manufacturers, and consequently consumers, start to see recycling as an item that is comparable in terms of cost with a substantial lengthening of the service life of products, our efforts to bring about the use of electrical and electronic waste will have only limited results.</p>

In accordance with the precautionary principle, authorisation procedures will be simplified, allowing consumers to have safer and more effective plant protection products. This is a significant improvement to current legislation, because it provides the industry with a more effective and reliable authorisation system, both with regard to requirements and procedures, resulting in uniform safety assessments.

Biocidal products are necessary for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and for the control of organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured products. Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (hereinafter ‘the directive’) establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for the authorisation and the placing on the market of biocidal products and the establishment of a positive list of active substances that may be used in biocidal products. The directive’s provisions require the Commission to draw up a report seven years after its entry into force and to submit the report to the Council. The review of the implementation of the directive has indicated that for the evaluation of active substances, the simplified procedures provided for in the directive, notably for low risk products, have no real effect, and that in addition, the data requirements and data waiving provisions may be unclear or inconsistently applied or lead to a disproportionate burden in some circumstances. The new regulation is seeking to improve the existing regulatory framework, without reducing the high level of protection for the environment and human and animal health, to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the Union, and to reduce the administrative burden for companies and public authorities.</p>

It is unprecedented in its inclusion of specific, comprehensive measures on nanomaterials. There was an urgent need to fill this gap in EU legislation. Those objects sold on the market and treated with biocides will therefore be required to mention on their label all the products used. With regard to substances considered carcinogenic or toxic for genes, reproduction or hormones, these will be strictly prohibited with the aim of protecting citizens and encouraging manufacturers to innovate by developing new, safer products. A word of caution, however. We should remain alert to new authorisations and the granting of renewals for exceptions. Member States will be able to make an exception only when absolutely necessary.

They enter the food chain, soil and water. Although the present legislation is the product of a compromise, it has achieved significant progress since it was first adopted in 1998. The following are regulated by law: a drastic reduction in carcinogenic substances and substances classified as toxic for reproduction; the facility for Member States to impose a ban or restriction where specific circumstances so warrant; stricter licensing; improved labelling and a ban on misleading information; a reduction in animal testing; the substitution of safer alternatives for dangerous substances; separate safety tests and labelling of products containing nanomaterials.

Since 2009, biocidal products have been subject to an authorisation and registration procedure which takes place nationally in the individual Member States and which is based on an assessment by the authorities of their efficacy and their risks to humans, animals and the environment. Inadequate efficacy and unacceptable effects should thereby be avoided when the products are used as intended. Authorisation of a biocidal product also includes binding instructions as regards labelling and, where appropriate, directions for use. Where this report is concerned, I spoke in favour of the amendments to the original draft because I consider it important that the active substances that will be subject to a simplified authorisation procedure are now listed in the annex to the regulation.</p>

Therefore, each country monitors their use very closely and takes care that they are used only when necessary and that they do not endanger people. The regulation on biocidal products harmonising the market rules for these products is necessary for two reasons. Above all, it assures EU citizens that each manufacturer must meet the same strict conditions in order for its product to be offered for sale. Producers must therefore maintain the same standards for the protection of human health and the environment. This uniform approach is, however, also beneficial for producers. It reduces the costs of certification of their products and enables them to supply their products to any EU country without having to undergo demanding authorisation procedures many times.

The situation is of particular concern for farmers in isolated regions, such as the outermost regions, for which the factors of distance and isolation already entail additional costs. As such, it is vital to promote transparency in order to identify what is leading to this situation, so encouraging resilience in the face of price volatility.

The privatisation of water is making it more expensive to use; the same applies to increased charges and prices for energy. The report supports the EU CAP, which is a disaster for farmers of poor and medium-sized holdings, and promotes the ‘competitiveness’ of farming in the EU, which means the concentration of land in large capitalist undertakings and the mass expulsion of poor farmers from their fields.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because I agree that with the growing cost of resources used in agriculture, we need to optimise agricultural production processes and improve resource management as much as possible. In my opinion, this would not only enable farmers to reduce input costs and increase their autonomy and income, but would also be a move to a more sustainable and user-friendly method of farming. For example, energy costs over the last decade have risen by approximately 60%, while farm gate prices have only increased by 25%. This report therefore proposes taking measures to increase the ability of farms to save energy in buildings, farming practices and transport use, and to invest in the production of renewable energy on farms or locally. Another area where management could be improved and savings could thus be made is the use of fertilisers and soil improvers. Solutions include improving farm nutrient analysis and management and better soil fertility analysis and management. Opting to use farm-saved seeds instead of certified seeds is another means of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production proposed by the report. Farm-saved seeds carry not only economic but environmental advantages – on average, they cost 40% less than certified seeds, they allow farmers to grow plants which are adapted to the specific agronomic conditions in their regions, and they often require less fertilisers, while at the same time maintaining crop biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In its resolution of 7 September 2010 on ‘Fair revenues for farmers: towards a better functioning food supply chain in Europe’, Parliament adopted a number of recommendations to solve problems downstream of farm production in order to improve farmers’ incomes. Substantial policy changes were proposed in EU competition law and recommendations were made for measures to be included in legislative proposals. The Commission adopted a follow-up note on this resolution in November 2010, in which it announced action in this matter. I believe that it is necessary to provide support for farmers in improving their agronomic and environmental performance, so that they can cope with the new climatic, environmental and economic challenges that they will have to face. Regarding ecological measures, farmers will probably have to reintegrate outsourced production costs associated with better management of biodiversity, water and soil nutrients, and it is for this reason that they will have to be given support. There is, however, an assumption that this initial expenditure will bring benefits to farmers from the long-term perspective, such as resistance to climatic instability, healthier and more productive land, and less vulnerability to disease. If they better learn to exploit the opportunities stemming from these inputs, they will also become more resistant to price fluctuations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report on the farm input supply chain provides an often pertinent analysis of Europe’s agricultural shortcomings. Not only is Europe highly dependent on imports of fossil fuels, but also of animal feed, phosphates and other inputs. The report does not provide any solutions, however, apart from asking the Commission for many new reports and more in-depth studies. It calls on the Commission to address the fact that the majority of phosphate rock comes from five countries. Even if the Commission lies down on a map of the world, it is not going to be able to change that situation. The report states that ‘cheaper feed (is) available on the global market’. This is particularly true of genetically modified (GM) soya, which makes up 80% of world production. However, the rapporteur is a figurehead of the anti-GM food movement, and he is fighting against shale gas, which is plentiful in Europe and could help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels if exploited. In light of these contradictions, I abstained.</p>

We now have a world population of 7 billion; in 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion, and in 2046, 9 billion! This means that decreasing numbers of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed, on average, by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue.

The high concentration in the agricultural inputs sector should therefore be a signal for the national anti-monopoly bodies that anti-competitive activities, such as abuse of market dominance, can be taking place to the detriment of producers and of end consumers.

Farmers are faced with a dire situation, starting with the leasing of land, especially in my country, Bulgaria, where 90% of livestock farmers do not own the land they use, then proceeding to the high prices for resources and materials, and ending with low farm gate prices. We need to adopt a two-pronged approach in order to tackle this situation. One aspect is linked to the work done by the institutions and competition authorities. We need to examine the reasons for the high prices for materials and avoid the situation where agribusiness traders are in a dominant position and engaging in unfair competition. Secondly, we must help farmers themselves to discover alternative ways of offsetting high prices, managing their resources effectively and adopting efficient, energy-saving measures, as well as of encouraging processing. Furthermore, we must not burden producers with other requirements and administrative procedures where fulfilling them will push their costs up even more.</p>

I consider it important to emphasise the need for greater cooperation and organisation among farmers – for instance, by collectively purchasing and storing inputs, cooperating in order to improve the use of resources, etc. Another means of increasing farmers’ income is to concentrate on the reduction of production costs – over the past ten years, production has become significantly more costly to farmers due to the overall rise in energy prices. In order to achieve some manner of harmonisation between expenses and income, agricultural producers must implement more and more energy and resource sustainable methods in production processes. As a result, in addition to the gathering of data concerning input and production costs, it would also be necessary to provide European farmers with guidelines regarding the best production solutions and practices, as stated in this report.</p>

Attention is drawn to the fact that due to resource scarcity, growing demand for food and EU farmers’ limited opportunities to obtain cheaper feed on the world market, upward pressure on input prices is constantly rising. It is therefore very important to ensure that farmers are given proper support so that agricultural and environmental performance improves and new climatic, environmental and economic challenges are addressed. I believe that in the next research framework programme, more funds need to be allocated for research and development in the efficient use and management of farm inputs and improving agronomic efficiency. Enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as farmers’ organisations, should also be encouraged at EU level.

The increased cost of industrial machinery is also noteworthy. In overall terms, costs for European farmers increased by 40% over the same period. It will come as no surprise, then, that EU farm incomes have fallen by 11.6% since 2009, according to Eurostat data. The difficult obstacles that farmers face can only be overcome with a comprehensive response that helps to restructure agricultural production, reducing its dependence on the volatility of demand and the inputs market.

The former, in particular, have seen a constant increase in production costs, while at the same time losing bargaining power vis-à-vis distributors. This imbalance is threatening to jeopardise the viability of many farms, which can only worry policy makers, particularly in the EU, in view of the possibility of the desertification of rural areas and increased unemployment in traditionally less developed regions. This pressure on producers is particularly significant in the outermost regions of the EU. I hope that a fairer and more transparent relationship might be possible between the various stakeholders in this market, without jeopardising its fundamental freedom, as this would guard against abuse of a dominant position and enable greater stability for farmers, as well as healthier competition.</p>

Rules on competition urgently need to be implemented more effectively in this sector, in order to uncover and prevent abuses of market power and cartel activity. Moreover, agricultural producers and processors – particularly small farmers and SMEs in the food chain – need to be placed in a better negotiating position as regards price levels within the value chain.

      <p sl="pt">Space policy is one of the key elements of the Europe 2020 strategy: it contributes to the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth by creating highly skilled jobs that currently employ more than 31 000 people, and by stimulating innovation. It also improves public well-being and security by enhancing, inter alia, transport, civil protection, and the development of social services for the elderly and disabled. Space is strategically important for Europe, and it is important to ensure a coherent European approach in this area, which will contribute to a robust, competitive and independent European space industry. These proposals are a step in that direction. It is important to ensure that there is appropriate and clear governance in relation to space policy and related programmes, with effective supervisory and coordination mechanisms, in order to harmonise priorities and ensure the optimal management of resources derived from the EU and its Member States. I support the development of an effective space policy able to respond to major global challenges and which must come about through the consolidation of the Galileo, EGNOS and GMES programmes, which promise enormous social, environmental, economic and strategic benefits. The relevant legislative and financial framework therefore needs to be completed as a matter of urgency.</p>

We have funding set aside for these programmes, which relates to their possible use for military purposes. That is the case with the GMES programme, which is aimed at global monitoring for the environment and security, and which includes earth observation and the ‘extraction of precise and useful data’ for preparing military operations and for covert ‘border surveillance’, as well as to ‘support EU External Action’, in addition to risk prevention, emergency management and coastal surveillance.

In addition to being an engine of industrial development, space policy plays a critical role in protecting the environment, in combating climate change, and in ensuring security for European citizens. That is why the main programmes it uses, Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Galileo, should receive adequate financial support from the EU. It has repeatedly been stressed that GMES is a key programme for crisis management, civil protection and humanitarian assistance operations.

      <p sl="pt">This comprehensive space strategy, which is included in Article 189 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and is an integral part of the flagship initiative on industrial policy in the Europe 2020 strategy, is aimed at enhancing the exploration and exploitation of space. Many areas will benefit from the technological development of the global satellite navigation system. The services and applications developed by the Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programmes will be of enormous benefit to the European economy and to the everyday lives of citizens. It is now necessary to maintain the lead in this area and enable technological development to create business opportunities for European industry. There is also a need to ensure compatibility and interoperability between Galileo and other orbital navigation systems. The potential that this investment will bring requires that the Commission take on some responsibilities, in particular, in terms of financing this strategy and coordinating it with the research programmes being carried out by the Member States. A clear sign of political approval is necessary to increase the interest of private enterprise.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the resolution on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens because space policy is a key element of the Europe 2020 strategy and an integral part of the flagship initiative on industrial policy. The aim of EU space policy is to improve the everyday lives of European citizens, enabling economic growth, fostering innovation potential and supporting scientific progress. Space solutions relying on state-of-the-art technologies and a competitive European industrial base are vital for addressing today’s important challenges in society, such as natural disasters, resources and climate monitoring, for developing the telecommunications sector and encouraging relevant applications in the fields of climate change policies, urban planning, environment management, agriculture, maritime safety, fisheries and transport. We call on the Commission to put forward specific proposals in the strategic area of launch vehicles, given the critical financial situation currently facing the launch sector across the globe. The Galileo and EGNOS programmes are vital for creating the Single European Sky and for the safe, reliable management of air traffic in Europe. We call for a firm, ambitious timetable and stable funding for research and innovation, which will ensure technological progress and the growth of industrial capacity. As GMES is an essential tool in combating climate change and environmental degradation, we recommend funding for GMES in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.</p>

The economic crisis overshadowing the EU should not act as a brake on financing for the relevant research programmes at a time when, as pointed out in the report, markets of space services are seeing rapid growth and may prove to be profitable.

The EGNOS and Galileo programmes are both key elements of EU space strategy which makes air travel safer by improving the accuracy of position – the new technology gives pilots their position to within a couple of metres. While I appreciate that new satellite technology can help improve passenger safety, we must be mindful of costs at a time of economic austerity. Last year, the Commission revealed that it would need a further EUR 2 billion to complete the Galileo project. The entire project will cost EUR 22 billion, almost entirely funded by the EU taxpayer. When this system was first proposed, we were told that costs would be considerably lower and that private investment would mean that taxpayers would only have to foot a bill of around EUR 2.5 billion.

Such cooperation should be aimed at exploiting this knowledge in order to solve problems and address current needs, with a view to development, social progress and human well-being, as well as peaceful ends. The report advocates a European space strategy based on a set of programmes such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, Single European Sky ATM Research and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). One of the objectives of the latter is ‘global monitoring for the environment and security’, which will be achieved through Earth observation and the ‘extraction of precise and useful data’, as well as operations involving ‘border surveillance’, as well as to ‘support EU External Action, maritime surveillance, complex emergencies, humanitarian aid and civil protection’. The resolution also calls for ‘strengthening the ‘security’ component of the GMES programme’. Behind these words lies the real danger that the monitoring-related information obtained from space will be used to carry out military operations, in addition to the clear aim of going further down the path of the obsession with security, violating the fundamental freedoms of citizens.

At global level, based on FAO 925 data, millions of people are at risk of malnutrition. In our opinion, food wastage is not the main cause of the global food problem; not that this means that it does not exist. The report conceals the cause of the problem, which is the capitalist method of production, which is not interested in meeting food needs; it is only interested in the profitability of the monopolies and in strengthening large producers at the expense of poor farmers. What food is produced and in what quantities depends on whether the multinationals will make a profit and is not designed to address global hunger. That is why the wish-list in the report cannot address the problem. The only definitive solution to the global food problem is to overturn the capitalist method of production and to replace it with the socialist system, in which food is produced on the basis of grassroots needs, not for the purpose of profit.</p>

Reducing food waste is a vital preliminary step in combating hunger in the world, responding to the increased demand predicted by the FAO and improving people’s nutritional levels.

Lastly, the resolution calls for the Commission to amend the public procurement rules on catering and hospitality services, so that when contracts are awarded, priority is given to ‘undertakings that guarantee that they will redistribute free of charge any unallocated (unsold) items to groups of citizens who lack purchasing power (…)’.

I agree that we need to invest more heavily in means of reducing food waste which would lead to a reduction in the losses incurred by agri-food businesses and a lowering of food prices, thus potentially also improving access to food for poorer sections of the population. Initiatives have already been launched in various Member States aimed at collecting unsold and discarded products locally throughout the food supply chain in order to redistribute them to citizens below the minimum income threshold, and Member States should exchange best practices in this area.

The objective that we need to achieve is a halving of food wastage by 2025 and thus improve access to food for deprived people. To achieve this massive reduction, new awareness-raising campaigns will have to be introduced, supported by food education classes in schools, and dual-date labelling could be introduced to show the ‘sell by’ date and the actual ‘use by’ date.

It also calls on the Commission and the Council to declare 2012 the ‘European Year against Food Waste’, precisely in order to raise awareness among institutions and consumers about the various kinds of damage caused by losing massive amounts of food along the food supply chain and, conversely, on the desirability of a change of course in this area.

It affects the entire food chain, from the producer to the final consumer, stretching from losses at harvest and storage through to poor securing of products during transportation, faulty packaging and the bad habits of final consumers when purchasing and using food. The paradox is that food is wasted both in industrialised and in developing countries. In industrialised countries, wastage occurs mainly during distribution and consumption, and is mainly due to the over-production of foodstuffs. In developing countries, food spoils right from the start of the chain due a lack of technology (for example, refrigeration equipment), the absence of transport systems and infrastructure and the lack of options for safe storage. There is little we can do about many of these factors: industrialised countries will not stop producing surpluses and the whole world cannot have advanced infrastructure and technology. However, we can do something right now about the disposal of food that can no longer be consumed. Most of this food ends up in mixed waste, and humanity thus produces millions of tonnes of mixed waste for which there is no space. The solution is to sort waste and to dispose of food biologically. Food recycled in this way can be returned to agriculture as natural fertiliser or humus. I welcome the start of the debate on this issue, and I will vote in favour of adopting the report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report addresses a problem that has become increasingly worrying: food wastage. The rapporteur seeks a holistic approach to the problem, covering the various links in the food supply chain and making proposals to make the chain more efficient. However, there are some significant shortcomings and even misunderstandings in the report. The extent of the problem of food wastage today is inseparable from the capitalist mode of production, the intensification of agriculture and the increased size of chains of production and consumption. It is important to note that small- and medium-scale agriculture, short supply chains, and local production and consumption are likely to reduce wastage and increase efficiency. Everything cannot, therefore, be put on the same level, and it is important to make this distinction. Moreover, in the context of current food supply chains, proposals such as food redistribution programmes for those in poverty and the application of discounts for products that are nearing expiry, apart from their charitable and welfare-related nature, mean dangerously opening the door to dumping and manipulation by the big retailers, which we cannot accept.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Food waste has assumed such proportions that it can be considered to be a global problem that is reflected right along the food supply chain. It occurs on farmland, in the processing industry, in distribution companies and in consumers’ homes. Food is wasted in industrialised countries and in developing countries. The wastage of food generates a chain parallel to the production chain and causes a whole series of negative externalities. The issue of food waste conflicts with the fundamental problem of food security, which is seriously compromised by a number of factors, including the limited natural resources compared to the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. Combating food waste must become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda. The Commission, Council and Member States should strive to adopt strategies and specific measures to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain, and to raise public awareness of this problem with a view to remedying the situation. People must be informed not only about the causes and effects of waste but also about ways of reducing it. For this reason, Parliament requests that 2013 be declared the European Year against Food Waste, serving as a key information and awareness-raising tool on this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="it">Every year, about 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted around the world, roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption. It is estimated that every European citizen throws away on average 179 kilograms of food per year, much of which is still edible. We must start off from these figures in order to adopt a coordinated European strategy and effective measures that can dramatically reduce food waste. To date, the European Union has underestimated this problem, fraught with consequences that are not only social but also economic and environmental. Recent studies show that no less than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries derive from the production of food that is then thrown away on a daily basis. With the resolution adopted today, we are calling for an integrated and coordinated approach to be introduced – from producer to consumer – to significantly reduce food wastage. Awareness raising and consumer education will play a key role in promoting the idea that what is wasted can instead become a resource. This has been successfully demonstrated by the ‘last minute market’, a project set up by the University of Bologna, which promotes the ‘reuse’ of food within solidarity networks.</p>

Meanwhile, Europeans waste between 95 kg and 115 kg of food per capita per year, as opposed to between 6 kg and 11 kg in sub-Saharan Africa. Causes included surplus food produced in industrialised countries, and the lack of efficient transport systems and infrastructure (the cold chain, for example) and secure storage facilities in developing countries.

The report addresses the issue very well. Waste is an ethical, environmental and economic problem whilst many international bodies are trying to find ways to ensure secure food supplies at a world level and whilst a part of the world’s population suffers from limited access to food. Wastage occurs along the entire food chain, from production to consumption. The report, moreover, defines five sectors: agricultural production, management and storage, processing, distribution and consumption. This wastage represents an environmental cost, since the production of unused surplus food requires the use of energy and natural resources, whilst entailing costs relating to the processing and disposal of the waste. According to a study organised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), between 95 and 115 kg of food is wasted annually per capita in Europe and North America.

When faced with a phenomenon which, in the last 30 years, has increased by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related, it does not seem ethically sustainable for about 80 million people in Europe to live below the poverty line. The tonnes of still edible food that are thrown into rubbish bins require disposal, a process which is often very expensive at both an economic and environmental level, and one which society itself is forced to pay when it could be doing much, often unconsciously, to limit its impact. I therefore believe that today’s vote is the start of a regulatory path through which, in future, we will be able to reconcile the needs of consumers, in terms of hygiene and information, through differentiated and simplified forms of packaging that are cheaper for businesses and which, therefore, lead to lower retail prices.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Food wastage has reached enormous proportions today, and should therefore be viewed as a global problem. It can be considered to be present throughout the entire food chain, from the producers to the consumers. According to estimates, more than half of our healthy and edible foodstuffs is wasted. The issue of food wastage contradicts the fundamental problem of food security, because the world’s population is steadily growing and with it, the access of the poorest strata of society to food is becoming increasingly limited, not to mention that the superfluous production of foodstuffs that are not consumed entails high environmental costs. The reasons behind wasteful behaviour, however, are not the same in every case. Whilst, in industrialised countries, the issue is chiefly concentrated around marketing and consumption due to the abundance of foodstuffs produced, in developing countries, it is caused by a lack of advanced agricultural procedures and safe storage options. These data clearly show that the amounts of food produced today should be reused for food purposes instead of simply being discarded like any other waste. The fight against food wastage should become a priority item on the agenda of European politics. A concrete strategy needs to be elaborated in order to cut food wastage in half across the entire food supply chain by 2025.

The world population is continuing to grow and, in the coming years, the global food supply challenge needs to be tackled and solved. It is therefore only right that we should begin not to waste what we already have at our disposal. In addition to causing economic harm to producers and consumers, the wastage of food also has a significant impact from a social point of view, and that is why the actions should be encouraged to support the collection and recovery at local level of unsold or discarded but perfectly usable products, so that they may, for example, be redistributed to the needy.

As living standards rise, we enjoy increasing choice and the availability of food products with aesthetic appearance, but we devote less and less thought to the sensible use of food. This is especially the case when the true extent of food wastage is invisible to the ordinary consumer, because the most extensive component of this wastage takes place during the phase in which food is produced and transported. In addition, consumers have become increasingly demanding regarding the appearance of food, and much food that is perfectly suitable for consumption is discarded solely due to its unsuitable appearance. There is also no reason why food that is approaching its expiry date should not be sold to consumers who are willing to purchase it for a lower price or even distributed as free food aid. Methods for the avoidance of food wastage are simple and readily available (purchasing the correct quantity of food, purchasing food produced by the producer who is nearest to the consumer, the proper storage of food, etc.), but these must also become ingrained among as many consumers as possible and be implemented among producers, suppliers and sellers of food.</p>

This is why I support the idea of promoting the primary sector and low food miles in the future common agricultural policy.

      <p sl="it">It will also be important to launch an awareness campaign providing information for citizens so that they are conscious not only of the causes and consequences of waste, but also of the desirability of reducing it.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. Food waste has assumed such proportions that it can be regarded as a global problem that is reflected right along the food supply chain, from the field to the fork. It is estimated, based on data gathered since 1974, that food waste around the world has risen by 50%. Waste occurs on farmland, in the processing industry, in distribution companies and in consumers’ homes; there is waste in industrialised countries and in developing countries. This squandering of food generates an industry parallel to the production industry and causes a whole series of negative externalities. The issue of food waste conflicts with the fundamental problem of food supply, which is seriously compromised by a number of factors, including limited natural resources as compared with the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. Hence, there has been a series of analyses and deliberations on the use we make of the food available to us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In these times of global economic crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, it is deeply unsettling to think that 1.3 billion tonnes of food could be lost or destroyed around the world every year. The first repercussion of wastage, and by far the most worrying, is a humanitarian one: despite food production levels that are sufficient to feed the world’s population, 25 000 people die each day as a result of chronic undernourishment. Food wastage can be seen at every stage in the chain, from harvest to consumption. The environmental impact of these failures is exacerbated and has knock-on effects on fisheries and energy resources as well as on waste management. We have the tools required to draw up and implement an effective policy for reducing food wastage. I am still convinced that a European information and awareness-raising campaign on this issue should be implemented, so that every party can take action at their own level.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Caronna because I believe that food wastage is a problem with not only European, but also global dimensions. Also, the European action plan proposes correct and realistic ways of addressing the problem. I consider it important to vote in favour of the report, because that will give the European Parliament the facility to be a useful means of informing and raising awareness among the public.</p>

      <p sl="it">The level of food waste has grown by 50% over the past 30 years. We cannot allow such waste to increase any further: the situation is not ethically sustainable. It has been calculated that about 200 tonnes of food waste per capita are produced every year, costing every family in the region of EUR 1 000 per annum. I voted in favour of the Caronna report because I agree with the need to do our utmost to take a substantial step forward towards reducing food waste. This report focuses on some key issues, such as recyclable packaging and the need to provide citizens with a complete food education, consisting of clearer information regarding product expiry dates, information that will help consumers make choices as well as ensuring greater transparency. I am convinced that we need to ensure that our citizens have a healthy, adequate and sufficient diet. There is a need for a European strategy to ensure greater efficiency and sustainability in the food supply chain, which should be finalised soon. I think it appropriate to exploit the potential opportunities of the fight against waste; particularly in this economic crisis, preventing waste is vital.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem of food wastage is becoming increasingly serious. According to the European Commission’s data, the annual generation of food waste in the 27 Member States amounts to over 89 million tonnes, or 179 kilograms per capita. On average, 20-30% of food purchased in European households is thrown away, two-thirds of which is still edible. Moreover, if we do not undertake decisive steps and measures, by 2020, the total amount of wasted food will have risen to around 126 million tonnes. The implications of food wastage itself are not only of an ethical, economic, social and nutritional nature. Food wastage also has consequences for health and the environment, since food waste contributes to global warming. In agriculture, cases of food wastage occur both during the production process as well as in the storage of agricultural goods. In the food industry, food is often already being wasted during the collection of raw materials, as well as during transport, when it is carried over thousands of kilometres. However, the problem is most acute in the case of households. Excessive purchases, elapsed expiry dates and the lack of proper management skills in relation to foodstuffs result in food ending up in the bin. Therefore, the Member States should adopt common strategies to combat this problem, starting with the exchange of good practice.</p>

      <p sl="it">According to several studies, food waste around the world has risen by 50% since 1974. The production of surplus food that we do not consume has a high environmental cost, deriving from the use of energy and natural resources, as well as from gas emissions into the atmosphere.</p>
      <p sl="it">The aim of this vote is to combat such a trend by reiterating the importance of spreading an anti-waste culture across the Member States, which must become one of the priorities on the European agenda.</p>
      <p sl="it">Citizens need to be informed not only of the causes and effects of waste, but also of ways to reduce it. A scientific and civic culture guided by the principles of sustainability and solidarity must be fostered so as to encourage better behaviour, particularly by supporting spontaneous initiatives taken by associations that publicise an anti-waste culture.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In a situation where almost 80 million people are living below the poverty line in the European Union, and more than half of the food waste, not only in European households but also along the food supply chain, could be avoided, I think that adopting this report marks an important step towards providing the poorest Europeans with greater access to food. We must already adopt at EU level all the measures necessary to tackle in the future the rise in the world population and, by extension, the issue of supplying them with the food they need. I also supported this report because it deals with problems relating not only to the environment and ethics, but also to the economic and social costs incurred by food waste.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Articles 191 and 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union state that EU policy on the environment will contribute to the prudent and reasonable use of natural resources and towards improving the quality of human health. Given that 79 million people in the EU are living below the poverty line, and that 16 million receive food aid from charitable institutions, I believe that it is crucial that measures be adopted to reduce food wastage. In view of this, I am voting for this report, as I believe there is a need to carry out a thorough analysis of the whole food supply chain in order to identify which food sectors generate the most waste, and to establish common food-related objectives at international level with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in order to facilitate the application of discounts to products nearing their expiry date. I also believe that increased exchange of best practices should be promoted, and that campaigns should be carried out to raise public awareness of the value of food and agricultural products.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on how to avoid food wastage: strategies for a more efficient food chain in the EU, because every year, roughly 50% of healthy, edible food is lost along the food chain in Europe, turning into waste. We call on the Council, the Commission, Member States and players in the food supply chain to address as a matter of urgency the problem of food waste along the entire supply and consumption chain and to devise guidelines and forms of support with a view to improving the efficiency of the food supply chain sector by sector. There are different reasons for food waste: overproduction, faulty product targeting (unadapted size or shape), deterioration of the products or their packaging, marketing rules (problems of appearance or defective packaging), or inadequate stock management and marketing strategies. We urge the Commission to assess the impact of a policy of enforcement with regard to food waste, aimed at all the stakeholders in the food chain, by applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle. We call on the Commission to create specific food waste prevention targets for Member States, as part of the waste prevention targets to be met by Member States by 2014, as recommended by the 2008 Waste Framework Directive.</p>

      <p sl="el">Food wastage is an issue which requires particular attention, especially in times of global economic crisis, and I am delighted that the European Parliament has taken this initiative to raise awareness among European citizens. According to data in the report, Europeans and North Americans waste between 95 and 115 kilograms of food a year, which is the highest figure in the world, at a time when there is starvation in developing countries. I agree that combating food wastage must be a priority of the European political action plan, which is why I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported today’s resolution which calls for food wastage in the EU to be halved by 2025. A staggering 50% of edible food is wasted each year, even though 79 million EU citizens live beneath the poverty line. We need an effective EU-wide strategy to tackle the issue of food wastage. I believe that new awareness campaigns would help inform people on how best to avoid food wastage and to use food sustainably. Schools and colleges could explain the need for effective cooking, storing and disposal of foodstuffs, which could help reduce the amount currently being thrown away. I also echo calls to make labelling on food packages clearer, so that both ‘use by’ dates and ‘sell by’ dates are displayed – this would help consumers make a more informed decision when purchasing food. In addition, the use of local produce should be promoted in catering and hospitality and the redistribution of food to poorer people free of charge should be encouraged.</p>

      <p sl="de">I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding.</p>

      <p sl="de">Food wastage around the world has increased by 50% since 1974. This not only contrasts sharply with the hunger in the world, but also gives rise to high and unnecessary environmental costs as a result of the production, preparation and disposal of food that is thrown away. It is therefore high time that the Commission, the Council and the Member States implemented specific strategies to combat this problem. Above all, it is important that citizens are aware of the causes of food wastage and are informed of how they can avoid throwing away food. I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Caronna has tabled a good report, which is why I voted in favour. It calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement specific measures to halve food waste by 2025, to improve the efficiency of the food industry and, in particular, to increase public awareness of this issue. We all have to do our bit here. The figures are alarming: in Germany alone, an estimated 20 million tonnes of food ends up being thrown away every year. Moreover, this is mainly happening right at the end of the food chain – in other words, it is being done by us, the consumers. Quite apart from the ethical issues of how we can allow this to happen when so many people do not have even the bare minimum, it also gives rise to environmental pollution and costs of disposal. We therefore all need to take a more sustainable attitude to food, and we politicians should impose fewer regulations on the food industry that only aggravate the problem. The German organisation Die Tafeln provides an example of a sensible option for reusing food that can no longer be sold. In Saxony alone, there are 35 Tafel, or table, charities; in Germany as a whole, there are around 900. Over 100 000 tonnes of food are donated to the Tafel organisations in Germany annually – unfortunately, that still leaves a lot of the 20 million tonnes going to waste.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my constituency of London, enough food to fill nearly 12 000 double-decker buses is thrown away every year. London is committed to cutting the amount of food sent to landfill. The London Food Board works hard to raise awareness of waste amongst both individuals and businesses. Household initiatives include residents using a specially provided kitchen caddy to collect food waste which is then sent for composting. Similarly, businesses are being encouraged to sign a ‘Food Waste Pyramid’ which asks them to avoid buying surplus food, redistribute any unwanted food to charities, and pass food unfit for human consumption to livestock. Many supermarkets and cafés in London have systems in place to give food at its ‘sell by’ date to homeless people, which is distributed via local members of the community. Food wastage is a problem for all EU countries. I therefore voted for this report as I believe we can share best practice across the EU on reducing the quantity of food waste that is being dumped into landfill.</p>
