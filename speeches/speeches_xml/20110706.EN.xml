      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the programme of activities of the Polish Presidency of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thus we begin the next Presidency of the European Union. For the European Parliament, the Presidency is even more important today than it was under the Treaty of Nice, because now we are responsible for enacting European legislation under the ordinary legislative procedure. This places additional responsibilities on us – on Parliament, and also on the Council – because all legislative measures for Europe now have to be negotiated. The Polish Presidency is also beginning at a difficult period for Europe – we are aware of this. So it is with great interest that we are going to listen to the programme proposed by the Polish Presidency, which will be presented by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Welcome, Mr Tusk, to the Chamber.</p>

    <intervention id="3-007-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Donald Tusk" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Barroso, chairs of the political groups, friends, honourable Members from all the Member States of the European Union and of all political persuasions, I am aware that I am in a place which, for the European Union and all Europeans who treat the idea of Europe seriously, is something special. It is a place which guarantees that the memory of where Europe has come from will be kept alive in our minds. In particular – this is how I view the many years of the European Parliament’s work – it is an institution and a place which has never stopped believing in the reason for having a united Europe. I say this not because it is the right thing to say, but primarily because my personal experience tells me that this is the case. The European Parliament has been extremely consistent in working for the unification of Europe, and is still working for this today. This unification does not just mean the accession of individual countries, but also has a more profound significance, thanks to which the citizens of the European Union, who have such a varied history and who are sometimes encumbered by the heavy baggage of history and their own experience, feel that Europe and the European Union are their political home. It was a decision of the European Parliament to entrust the office of President of the European Parliament to a Pole which meant, among other things, that the division in the European Union between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ Europe finally lost its meaning and became a thing of the past.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I remember, too, something which has certainly already passed into history, but it is, for me, a living memory. I am thinking of decisions taken by the European Parliament which showed a belief in Europe and gave a feeling of the meaning of Europe to all those who, for many years, could only dream of Europe. I remember very clearly when the Solidarity movement, the great dream of the Poles – which was also about Europe – was broken by the imposition of martial law in Poland, and a matter of hours later, the European Parliament gave a very clear signal that it had not forgotten those who were not being given the chance to live in freedom. I remember, too, that when, many years later, along with half of Europe, we regained the independence of our countries and the freedom of our citizens, but were in a state of total economic collapse which involved, among other things, a gigantic level of debt, it was once again the European Parliament which issued a very strong signal calling for the radical debt reduction which allowed Poland and many other countries to get back on their feet. It was a decision which showed European solidarity to be of the highest quality. It was a decision which, over the next 20 years, allowed tens of millions of Europeans to escape from an economic crisis and a crisis of civilisation, a crisis which was incomparably deeper than the phenomena which we are calling a crisis today. What happened at that time – and this was also thanks to the European Parliament and to everyone who believed in the significance of solidarity as the foundation of a united Europe – is today, I think, an excellent lesson for those who do not believe that a united Europe, a Europe which believes in its own abilities, will also find a remedy for the present crisis. I would like to say once again to those who do not remember those events: for all those Europeans who had to spend several decades of their lives in poverty and oppression, today’s crisis is an important challenge, but is not an insurmountable one, and does not bear comparison with the one from which we emerged thanks to the solidarity shown by the whole of Europe. In relation to this, I would like to get straight to the point by setting out what, in my opinion, are the most important areas, not only for the next six months of the Polish Presidency, but what are also permanent areas of responsibility and permanent challenges for the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is the simplest of questions; there is nothing complicated about it. Is the answer to the crisis – both to the immediate one related to the financial crisis and the situation of some countries in Europe, particularly in the south of Europe, and the answer to the deeper crisis, the crisis of confidence in Europe, the global crisis – is the answer to be a departure from Europe, a reduction of what is European and held in common, or is it to be what we have proved over many years and what has worked well?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Both the experience of Europe as a community, as well as the personal experience of every one of us, tell us that the best response of Europeans – the best answer Europeans have come up with – is a united Europe. There is something I would like to stress as strongly as possible – I have, indeed, spoken about this many times in the presence of many of you who are here in this Chamber today, because I am not making this speech just for the purposes of today’s inauguration of the Presidency – a united Europe, its institutions, its budget and its goals are not the cause of the crisis. We know very well, after all, where the sources of the current financial crisis are, and it would be a wrong answer and the worst possible answer if we were to believe those who are saying: let us cut back on Europe and this will be our answer to the crisis. History shows that when Europeans have believed that the right response to threats is a rise in manifestations of nationalism, statism and protectionism, this has invariably ended in disaster.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we are not faced by such great dangers as in the past, but the historical awareness – the knowledge of what the history of Europe has been like from the beginning – forces us to believe in the recipe of solidarity among nations, solidarity among people, a readiness to help when others need it, and solidarity understood not as charity, but as working together in the common interest – where sometimes some have to give more, so that those who need help now will, at some time in the future, be able to give back even more.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">We sometimes hear, today, that the best response to the financial crisis, or the crisis precipitated by events in North Africa and the associated rise in illegal immigration, is to increase the number of barriers inside Europe. I would like to say that the discussion about Schengen is a basic and extremely graphic illustration of the dilemma Europe is facing, today. From our point of view, it is in Europe’s interest to protect what I think are the fundamental rights of its citizens, which include free movement within the European Union without borders (applause), and this is a value which we should rigorously uphold. This does not, after all, conflict with our conviction that the external borders of the European Union should be well guarded. The reason we are building the Union, and this includes when we enlarge it, is also to enable every member to have as much freedom as possible as part of the Union. The Union will be safe if we guard its external borders well. We can extend those borders and we should enlarge them, but creating barriers inside the Union is not the way to protect our Union. This is an incorrect response (applause), and this is why strengthening Frontex will be such an important area of work, and not just for these six months. I do understand all of those who are worried by the emigration situation, but they are looking for precisely the erroneous solution I have described. We have to understand them, but we must also take steps to protect Europe from a reintroduction of internal barriers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the context of the crisis, we sometimes also talk about what should be done with the European budget, which is, without doubt, one of the European Union’s most important tools. Sometimes we do not believe there is any point in strengthening the European institutions. I think that in view of this dilemma, it is extremely important for us, today, to adopt a stance which is open and free from hypocrisy. I am certain that the answer to the crisis is more Europe and more European integration (applause), and this requires strong European institutions. I believe this profoundly, but that belief is also underpinned by the experience of an entire generation of millions of Europeans who once lived on the other side of the former Iron Curtain. All of our experience tells us that more Europe – which does not mean more ideology or more of a kind of hypocritical philosophy – more Europe means very practical decisions. More Europe means the judicious spending of European money, European institutions which are capable of making decisions, more European policy, more European leadership. If we do not take up this challenge, we will be increasingly powerless in the face of the global dimensions of the crisis. Our experience tells us, too, that for the individual, more Europe means quite simply more freedom, more prosperity, more practical solidarity, more security. Is a united Europe not the answer to our experience from the First and Second World Wars? Is it not the case that here in Europe, a united Europe is the best idea for protecting us from ourselves? In our history, we have also been a danger to ourselves. An integrated Europe of free citizens is also a Europe which is internally secure, but is also one which is safe from external threats.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">I know that not everyone shares this view, although I am convinced that irrespective of whether they are deeply convinced Europeans or sceptics, everyone shares the system of values on which the united Europe is founded. We may criticise one or other aspect of Europe as an institution, but no one in this Chamber questions the validity of liberty, human rights, democracy, freedom of speech or freedom of religion. Let us observe that on a world scale, Europe is the place where – even if not everything is going well for us – the fundamental values with which we all agree are the best protected in the world. It cannot be the case, and I am profoundly convinced of this, that here in Europe, doubts are growing as to its validity, but outside Europe, just as happened 10 or 20 years ago, millions of people are longing to be able to live in a civilisation with the political, social and economic conditions which we Europeans enjoy. Sometimes we stop believing that this is the best place on earth, but everyone outside the European Union knows that this is the best place on earth.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">This is not ideology. The problem of illegal immigration takes up so much of our debates, and we do, of course, have to deal with this somehow, but while we are on the subject, let us notice that the direction of this immigration is always the same, and has been for decades. Never from the European Union to other parts of the world, but always into the European Union from outside. By their decisions and the way they flee places where they can expect servitude, poverty or distress, people themselves show us every day that Europe is indeed the best place in the world, and that no one has yet thought of anything better. This is the case, after all, not because God is minded that people should live better here than in other parts of the world. Manna does not fall from heaven here. Things are better here because we have persevered in strict faithfulness to the fundamental values on which the united Europe is built.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The memory of where Europe has its roots is also a very important foundation of our thinking, today, in connection with the crisis. We often talk about Greece. Some people associate Greece only with financial problems and breaches of the rules of financial discipline.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, let us not look for a scapegoat. Let us ask ourselves if we are sure that we have all been faithful to the principles we set ourselves when we were looking for ways to combat the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, let us also remember that in our European consciousness, Greece does not mean painful financial problems, but problems which are, in fact, somewhat trivial. I am not treating them lightly, but they are trivial in nature. Greece is also the experiment which, 2 500 years ago, taught people and politicians – feuding city-states – what is meant by solidarity in the face of a global threat. After all, we all have our roots there – we would not be in this Chamber, and there would not be a Europe, if people who had once been at odds over minor interests had not got together one day and said: we can and we must be together when such a challenge arises. So for me, I associate Greece much more with Pericles than with today’s demonstrations over financial cuts. I say this because an effective fight against the crisis must have this kind of historical memory, so that we know what we are actually defending.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish priorities, or rather Europe’s priorities during the Polish Presidency, are in line with our conviction that the more we have of Europe, the less we will have of the crisis – I mean Europe understood as a guarantee of the values to which I referred. So this is why we are looking for a Europe which is secure in several ways, and this is why it will be our priority for Europe to be secure, including from the obvious point of view of its military security. It is high time a debate was begun about how Europe will be able to take coordinated action in a future situation of danger. We are talking about a Europe which is secure in terms of energy, food supply and raw materials. Security is the key to understanding the phenomenon of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a second priority, the validity of which I strongly believe in – the clear progress which we want to achieve in terms of the Single Market, including the developing Internet market. Freedom, and this includes removing more barriers which are hampering development of the free market, can, as it has in the past, be a source of growth for Europe. If Europe is not just security but also prosperity, then we must believe anew that the sources of prosperity have always been the same: unrestricted human enterprise, a minimum of barriers, boldness in making decisions, the priority of people over institutions, the priority of the market over the state and equal rules of play for everyone in the market. So this is why the Single Market and its development will be our second priority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a third matter to which we want to devote a considerable amount of energy – an open Europe. If we are successful – and I believe we will be – in building a secure and well protected Europe without internal barriers, then we will not have to be afraid about opening that Europe up to others.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The next six months also mean progress in negotiations with those who aspire to be in Europe – a Europe which is also open to those who perhaps will never be part of our Union, but who share the essential values of our community and who, in recent months, have shown this to be the case. I refer to Europe’s southern neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Eastern Partnership, completion of the accession process for Croatia by signing the Treaty, the association agreement with Ukraine, judicious and well thought-out assistance for those who want democracy and freedom in North Africa – these are tasks which, if we perform them well, can also strengthen the European Union itself. The vision we are going to want to propose is a very practical one. We want more Europe not only in Europe itself, but also in the countries which lie around Europe, if we understand Europe to be that system of values which we agreed upon when the European Union was founded. I do realise the Presidency lasts only for six months, and I do not have exaggerated ideas about the tools which the Presidency has at its disposal. I know the Treaty of Lisbon. I do not overestimate the role of individuals in history, although they are not roles which should be ignored. Despite the modest tools available to the Presidency, and despite the fact that this is a time of crisis which we are feeling so acutely, I am certain we will contribute a great deal of Polish enthusiasm, Polish energy and Polish optimism, something which has allowed us to come through the crisis fairly safely, because we really do believe in Europe and we want, together with you (applause) and by carrying out these practical tasks, to enable us to open a fresh chapter of investment in Europe, and to help us all to believe in Europe again. I know this is possible, and in this work I will be at your service, at everyone’s service without exception, for the full six months. I am counting on your help. Thank you.</p>

    <intervention id="3-008-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Thank you, Mr Tusk, for your speech and its presentation of the most important work which we have before us in the next six months, as well as for the vision and conception of Europe as it is seen from Poland’s perspective. Thank you very much for your presentation.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, and I will now ask him to speak.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-009-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, please allow me to start by thanking Prime Minister Tusk for not only outlining his vision for the first Polish Presidency of the Council, but also his vision on Europe. Your words, Prime Minister, were very inspiring. I know they come from a sincere commitment to, and belief in, the importance of our European project, a project based on values. As Poland embarks upon its historic journey at the helm of the Council of the European Union, let me tell you that I have every confidence that Poland will uphold this vision, your vision, with rigour, and will execute the strategy with the same authority that it has shown in preparing this Presidency. In doing so, Poland will have the full support of the European Commission. For we, too, have a similar vision of Europe, the Europe we want to see in ten years from now.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a vision of – and a plan for – a strong, confident and innovative Europe. A Europe with high employment, quality jobs for its citizens and competitive, knowledge-based industries. A Europe with a fully exploited internal market. A Europe that is open – open inside, but also open to the world. A Europe whose citizens feel secure and confident in their futures. The plan to execute this vision is detailed in the Europe 2020 strategy for sustainable, inclusive and smart growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">To allow this plan to flourish, we need stable macro-economic foundations with the financial backstop stability mechanisms, tighter financial regulation and enhanced budgetary coordination. Here, I would like to once again express how urgent it is for the European Parliament and Member States to come to an agreement sooner rather than later on the final points on the economic governance package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad that the Polish Presidency has seamlessly continued the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency to find a solution, together with the European Parliament. With all these elements in place, we will need the right tools to make this vision a reality and put Europe back on a track to prosperity. The Commission believes that the proposals we presented last week for the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework will be a crucial instrument in delivering this vision.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I explained yesterday in this Parliament, the fundamental guiding principle in the Commission’s budgetary proposals is to ensure European added value. Poland is indeed a strong advocate of the added value of the European Union. We just heard in very clear terms this commitment of Prime Minister Tusk. Therefore, I look to the Presidency to shape the debate on the EU’s future budget over the second half of this year in rational and constructive terms. Let me tell you that I am very encouraged by the positive reactions of this Parliament, and also by the early reaction in Council considering the proposal a credible and solid basis for negotiations. The important work to be done in the coming months will not only have a fundamental impact on the discussions next year, but it will also lay the ground for Europe’s future prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The overarching priority of our proposals is to boost European growth and jobs. This means strengthening the backbone of our internal market by funding better connections for energy, transport and IT between Member States. It means increased and targeted spending on research, innovation and education to boost competitiveness; believing in our future by investing in our young people. Together with the forthcoming initiatives to deepen the Single Market, these proposals will, I hope, be strengthened by the positive vision of the Polish Presidency on ‘European integration as the source of growth’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The budget proposals aim to enhance our security, which is also one of the three pillars of the Polish Presidency agenda. Security means improving our environment and climate. It means guaranteeing our energy supply. It means helping Europeans to feel safe by investing in the fight against crime and terrorism, as well as dedicating resources to migration and asylum policies. Security and freedom of circulation are not incompatible. In this context, I refer to recent news coming from Denmark. As you know, I expressed directly to the Prime Minister of Denmark, in May, my grave concerns relating to respect of Treaty freedoms – free movement of goods, services and persons – and of the Schengen acquis. Since then, intensive and constructive contacts between the Commission services and Denmark are taking place on a daily basis at different levels. Denmark assures the Commission that it has no intention of infringing EU law and is ready to cooperate with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will assess in detail the recent measures introduced by the Danish authorities. Free movement of people, goods and services is a central piece of the European construction and guaranteed by the Treaties that all Member States have ratified.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Undermining free movement is jeopardising the internal market, solidarity among Europeans and the very European project. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will do its utmost to ensure this is respected all over Europe. We have done it in the past; we will do it in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third pillar of the Presidency’s agenda is Europe’s openness to the world. The Commission has also sought, throughout the budget proposals, to guarantee an open Europe. We believe that Europe must invest in the stability and prosperity of its neighbourhood to the East and South, both because it is morally right and because it makes sense economically. In this regard, I welcome the Presidency’s commitment to our Eastern neighbourhood, which will culminate in the Eastern Partnership summit in September.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also pay tribute to the Polish Presidency’s commitment to build on the support Europe has shown in the first half of the year to the democratic movements in our southern neighbourhood. I moreover look to Poland to advance with the preparations for Croatia’s accession treaty with the same dedication as demonstrated by the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Securing our future is also about securing our values, not letting them be threatened by short-term concerns. Solidarity is a concept so perfectly espoused by the Poles (I will venture to say that the Polish word that is most known outside Poland is solidarność). Solidarity is an integral part of the entire financial perspective proposal: solidarity with our poorer regions, solidarity also with neighbouring countries that need our support, but, above all, solidarity with our children and grandchildren, to do our best to ensure they inherit a sustainable and strong Europe, a Europe we can be proud of.</p>
      <p sl="en">Poland is indeed a European success story. It has not only escaped recent recession but has become one of our Union’s drivers of growth. This puts Poland in a strong position to pursue the financial perspective discussions in the Council and the European Parliament in a spirit of responsibility and ambition.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a time of widespread uncertainty in Europe, Poland will need to show strong leadership to steer a course through turbulent events while maintaining its ambitious agenda. Historic times such as the ones we are living through demand historic leadership. I believe that you, Prime Minister Tusk, and Poland, can provide this kind of leadership in the Council. The Commission will fully support the Polish Presidency’s vision of a more strong, secure and open Europe. I am confident in Poland’s ability not only to lead the Council of the Union, but also to breathe new enthusiasm and optimism into the European project.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, by way of an introduction, allow me to say, Mr President-in-Office, that if, during these six months, you apply the European method you have described this morning – as I do not doubt you will – we will be considering ways to extend the Polish Presidency of Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">European integration will be at the heart of the priorities of the new Presidency of the Council, to the great satisfaction of our group. This integration, and especially this Community method, must feature in all the major debates over the coming months and years. I am thinking of the financial resources of Europe. It is a significant issue that we will discuss together for the 2014-2020 period. I am also thinking of the internal market. Mr Tusk, you are concerned about the rise of Euroscepticism in several countries. I share this concern, as does my group. Euroscepticism and isolationism are symptoms of a cancer in our society. Your response to this ‘every man for himself’ attitude is a call for integration, which echoes the watchword of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is not the problem, but ‘more Europe’ is the solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your Presidency will be dominated by the necessary consolidation of public finances in the Member States, the stabilisation of the euro and the opening of the debate on the financial framework. The euro can only be stabilised if the countries experiencing difficulties really implement the necessary reforms in order to reform public finances and to create the conditions to enable a return to sustainable growth. Half-hearted measures will not solve the underlying problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I take the case of Poland, which is growing by nearly 4% and, with an uncommon level of efficiency, has known how to best use EU funds since it became a member, I see that European solidarity, combined with political will, can lead to the construction of a real, solid economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Tusk, you are one of the few Heads of State or Government in Europe to agree to debate with the national parliaments, with this Parliament and with other European institutions about the issue of the resources needed for Europe to operate. You are, moreover, the only one willing to discuss an issue that is important to a large majority in this Parliament, namely, the introduction of own resources to finance Europe’s role. Therefore, we will be by your side to deal with this issue seriously and we know that this task will be challenging.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Presidency of the Council believes that all our economic and social policies must be based on the Europe 2020 strategy, which all Member States have already accepted. It is right because the economic crisis will only be overcome in a sustainable manner if the Member States understand that all 27 States acting together is less expensive and much more productive than each one acting in isolation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, is not just virtuous; it is also profitable. That goes for European finances as well as for the internal market and I am pleased that the Polish Presidency has established this issue and, in particular, electronic services, improved working conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the long-awaited creation of a European patent system, or indeed the Single Market Act, as its main concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Tusk, just like the European Parliament, you have found the recent disagreements on the Schengen issue hard to bear. My group supports you in your desire to strengthen our resources and our joint effort on our external borders. In this regard, I call on the Commission and the Council to take a clear position on the unilateral decision made by Denmark to exempt itself from the rules on freedom of movement. My group would like to express its serious concerns. I would like to know what your position is, and that of the President of the Commission.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, some commissioners will not be able to take holidays in July and August, since it will also be necessary, at this time, to closely monitor the Danish borders. I stated yesterday that perhaps we should think about introducing visas for Danes to be sent to Europe so they are better protected!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just as the European Parliament has done, you have identified the key challenges for Europe, which are food security and energy dependence. It will certainly not be possible to resolve all these issues in just six months. You will at least be able to take the credit for raising them and, as I told you when we met in Warsaw, it will be you who will lay the foundations, and I am certain that they will be solid foundations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by commending your determination in the management of relations with your neighbours. We have recently often discussed support for our southern neighbours, and firm policies on this issue should be developed. Relations with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as with other countries like Ukraine and Belarus, in particular, are just as deserving of our attention and efforts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Tusk, my group has great expectations of your political will and your leadership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by drawing inspiration from the words of a great Pole whom you know well, Pope John Paul II: ‘Do not be afraid, Mr Tusk: go ahead; we are with you’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, 22 June marked the 70th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union. Poland had already been destroyed at that point. The Europe that emerged from this criminal war, in which Nazi Germany destroyed Poland, the Europe in which Stalinism enslaved the country for 40 years and more, was a different Europe from the Europe we have today. The speech that Mr Tusk has just given here illustrated that an awareness of the value of Europe underpins the Polish Presidency. For that alone, we are grateful to you Prime Minister.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Europe is suffering from a common mind-set among governments, whatever their political hue, that is characterised by despair and a lack of inspiration, the delusion that you can use national measures to solve problems in this global village, where an incident in one corner of the world can become the subject of local debate here. Schengen, the debate we are holding now, is an eloquent example of just that. This mismatch between reality and political rhetoric is what Europe is suffering from. That is a huge risk for our project.</p>
      <p sl="de">Poland, on the other hand, is taking a different approach. As Poland explained here this morning through its Prime Minister as President-in-Office of the Council, ‘the best protection for our national interests is the European formation, the European convoy’. That is quite a different concept. Europe is suffering from governments which decide everything – either by taking part actively or sitting in silence – and then go home and, when the first negative comment appears in a newspaper, blame the European institutions for what they themselves decided. Poland, on the other hand, stands for a different concept.</p>
      <p sl="de">This morning, we heard a President-in-Office of the Council present the concept that his Presidency wants: partnership between the national governments and the European institutions; after all, cooperation between national politics and the European institutions, rather than an adversarial approach, is Europe’s recipe for success. This is the Head of Government of a country that was also a member of the Warsaw Pact. This is the Head of Government of a country that was also repressed by the Soviet Union. However, he is also the Prime Minister of a country who, unlike his predecessor in the position of President-in-Office of the Council, does not wade in by comparing Brussels with Moscow; on the contrary, he says that Europe is not part of the crisis; it is an instrument for overcoming our problems.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">When Jean-Claude Juncker commented on the last financial perspective, he said that he was ashamed, because the financial perspective was a call for national self-interest, not a European team effort. That was the last financial perspective. Now, we have governments in the process of raising national self-interest to a political credo. The Polish Government has a different concept. We heard about disciplined spending, yes; but we also heard about intelligent investment policy in Europe to boost growth because, without growth, there will be no jobs, and with no jobs, there will be no social security.</p>
      <p sl="de">Solidarity in Europe, solidarity between the strong and the weak within countries, and between the strong and weak countries, that is the concept of the Polish Presidency, not playing national budgets off against the European budgets. We have – I think one could say – heard a great speech. The Polish national anthem contains the beautiful line that Poland is not yet lost. Based on that, may I say to you, Prime Minister,</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe is not yet lost while we are yet alive!</p>
      <p sl="de">We still maintain the ideal of a single Europe, a Europe of solidarity, that creates welfare for everyone through transnational solutions and that safeguards peace in Europe and, through Europe, in the world at large, rather than trying to conquer it, at least not while we have such Presidents-in-Office of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think it is an understatement when we say that the Polish Presidency comes at a crucial moment for Europe. I think this has already been said three or four times this morning. We normally always say it. Every six months, we say that it comes at a crucial moment, but this time I think it is true to say that.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a crisis in Greece and a crisis for the euro, as well as a disintegration through the reintroduction of border controls in a number of Member States. More generally, I think that the crisis in Europe is more the revival of nationalism and of populism which we see in a number of Member States – even in Member States in the north of Europe who thought in the past that it was impossible for them to be attacked by this kind of nationalism and populism.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to congratulate Mr Tusk because we have heard this morning from one of the only political leaders in Europe who is not going in the direction of nationalism and populism, as most of his colleagues for the moment are doing. He knows that, in order to really solve our problems, we need not less integration in Europe but more integration in Europe. I think that is also the tradition of Bronislaw Geremek, a great Polish political leader. I also think, Mr Tusk, that this is partly a consequence of the fact that you are a historian. We are all lawyers and economists here – I do not know what we all are, but I do not think that there are many historians. Maybe it is because you are a historian and because you know about what happened in the past that you have such a message for us. Let us face the reality: without the European Union, this continent is a continent of disputes, war and even of genocide. That was the past. You, as a historian, can remind us of that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us face the reality today. That is, in fact, the big issue for your Presidency. We are at a crossroads. Either we are becoming the UN of Europe or we are becoming the US of Europe. Either we are becoming a loose confederation – as the Eurosceptics want – with once again nation states in the driving seat and without any real European integration, coordination and solidarity, or we really do become this federation and this political and economic union that we absolutely need in order to create wealth for our citizens and to create peace and stability in this difficult, multipolar world. That is the choice we are facing today, the real choice. I know some people are afraid of a United States, but that is the real choice to be made. Either we go in the direction of political and economic union and we can solve our problems relating to the euro, Greece, Portugal and Ireland and so on and we do not disintegrate; or we say that we want to be the UN of Europe, a loose confederation where, from time to time, we make speeches about solidarity but, in reality, do not show this solidarity and this union.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the substance, I think you have to have three priorities, and I do not think that you can escape them. First, regarding the Greek crisis, you have to find a solution for the discussion on economic governance. I am very sure that you can explain to the Heads of State or Government, your colleagues, that they have to make a move in the next days and weeks because you believe in the position of the Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we are very pleased that you support the idea of this Parliament launching a conference on the future financing of Europe because I think that is the best way forward. Bring the national parliaments into the debate and I am very sure that, in the end, they can agree on Commission proposals that have been launched.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, regarding Schengen, I do not think we should agree with every colleague in the European Union who says that these are exceptional circumstances and that we should go back to national borders and national border controls. Together with the Commission, say ‘no’ to the attempts to reinstate these national border controls inside the Union. Mr Tusk, you are not from our group – we all thought that a civic platform by its nature has to be, but that is a little detail – but I can tell you that we will be your best allies in your fight for more Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists, I would like to say that we very much want the Polish Presidency to be a success, because we believe that it can bring fresh energy to the somewhat stuffy atmosphere of the European institutions. There is here, however, a certain problem. Your government, Mr Tusk, has decided that during the Polish Presidency, parliamentary elections will be held in Poland. This means that your cabinet will not see out the Presidency. We will meet in December for the review of the Presidency, but with a different government. Irrespective of who will then be Prime Minister, one way or another, it will be a different government. Besides, we know that during election campaigns, all cabinets only run at idle speed. I fear that in the case of the Polish Presidency, the same may happen again. I hope, too, Mr Tusk, that you will not give in to the temptation, although such voices are to be heard in Poland in the government camp, to limit democratic debate using the argument that whoever criticises the government during the Presidency harms both the country and Europe. Mr Tusk, I would like to remind you that silencing political competitors is not approved of in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is one more thing – your ministers are saying that the Polish Presidency will want to promote integration and strengthen our sense of community. That is all very well, but what does it mean in practice? We are seeing two forms of political arrogance in Europe. One of them is the movement towards a federal, post-national Europe, and that arrogance is provoking the anger of millions of people who live in our continent and who have had enough of social engineering. The second form of arrogance is the conviction of the strongest countries, principally Germany and France, that it is they who should be wielding authority in Europe. This arrogance provokes the anger of many of my fellow Members of this Parliament, from both the Left and the Right.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We in the ECR Group are Eurorealists, and we believe that Europe’s strength lies in the freedom, enterprise and culture of Europe’s nations and states. We believe that you will contribute in some way to a weakening of these forms of arrogance, and that your efforts will mean, on the one hand, that we will no longer be threatened with the closure of states and the top-down creation of a European demos and, on the other, that you will bring about a reduction of the feeling in Europe that there is a difference between those who are equal and those who are more equal. This, Mr Tusk, will be a real European test of leadership. Will you take up the challenge as a strong Presidency of the Union, or will you content yourself with what is easy, agreeable and painless, but which is also of no significance? Will you be long remembered as a resolute leader, or will you be forgotten as a politician of safe conformity?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, following on from the last speech, I should like to come back to what my fellow Members have already said. When we visited Warsaw, we found that, unlike at the start of other Presidencies of the Council, there was an atmosphere of joy and celebration surrounding talk of the Polish Presidency of the Council. What you have succeeded in achieving in your speech is something quite extraordinary. I have not been in the European Parliament that long, but I have rarely seen a Head of State manage to define the idea of Europe as you have just done, …</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">… not simply by defining the European Union as a political instrument, but also by outlining the idea of the European Union as an extended homeland, a homeland of national states and citizens in those national states; I should like to thank you for that. That does a power of good in these times of difficult debate, particularly since your predecessor in the Presidency of the Council took his leave of us with verbal pot-shots at the European Parliament, so that we had almost become accustomed to a man, who also represents Hungary in his House, who equated Vienna, Moscow and Brussels. If that is now in the past, Mr Tusk – and I think that is what this speech means – then we have much better preconditions for all the problems we need to resolve.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">A word about the crisis: Mr Verhofstadt said that we have spoken with each Presidency of the Council about the particular challenge not only of the double crisis, but also of the triple crisis. I should like to encourage you to do what we talked about in Warsaw: separate the problems of the heavily indebted countries and the resolution of these problems in Greece, Portugal and other countries from the tasks that face us in the debate on the global financial crisis. Ensure that a fair approach is taken. Solidarity with the heavily indebted countries is one thing; while fairness in implementing these austerity programmes, justice in these countries, is something quite different, and is still awaited.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps you will also manage to take the next step and tackle the ‘new deal’ being discussed in the press once again, in addition to the austerity and solidarity measures. Greece and other heavily indebted countries need the prospect of an end to this crisis and that will not happen without an investment programme. However, you must not forget in the midst of all this that Europeans need to change the approach they have taken to the global financial markets in the past. We have still not understood the real implications of this global financial crisis and a great deal remains to be done here.</p>
      <p sl="de">With reference to this new deal: as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I must say that I am hoping for a green new deal when we come to draw up these investment programmes. The challenges we have often formulated, from ecological crises and from the climate crisis, must be accepted in this economic crisis. It makes no sense to turn back the clock, forgetting the challenges of global warming, forgetting about Fukushima, for example, even though this was recognised as the writing on the wall just a few months ago. What Poland could achieve in the debate on the green new deal would be to drive sustainable economic growth in the energy sector, including for Poland. You need to invest a great deal here and grasp the nettle on Europe’s behalf. You only stand to gain. I hope that we shall be able to agree on the idea of climate protection and sustainability in the push for investment, not only for the indebted countries, but for the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Röttgen, the German Federal Minister for Environmental Affairs, a person I do not often quote but am happy to do so now, said that 6 million new jobs can be created through an ambitious sustainability policy. Mr Tusk, let us also conclude a pro-European pact on this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tusk, the Polish Presidency may be able to offer some ray of hope in a time of crisis when there is little enthusiasm for Europe. A clear majority of the Polish people are positively disposed towards the EU, far more so than in many other countries. I very much welcome the openness promised in the Presidency’s programme, which includes better relations with our neighbouring states of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. As Poland’s western neighbour, Germany has had some positive experiences in relation to cooperation between regions close to national borders. There is a wide range of political challenges that we are all facing.</p>
      <p sl="de">In relation to the decisions on economic governance, we need more open, respectful cooperation between the EU institutions, in particular, between the Council and Parliament. In terms of substance, I can only reiterate that we need to start rescuing people, not just the banks. Let me say something on the reform of the EU budget. I do not believe that the budget can realistically be frozen for the medium term. Populist slogans like ‘It is time for the EU to tighten its belt’ clearly miss the point. In this time of crisis, the EU can and must demonstrate its added value by acting as an effective community based on solidarity and that is how I interpreted your speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that there is room for improvement in the agenda in relation to energy and climate policy. A new global agreement on climate change to follow on from the Kyoto Protocol will have to be reached in the coming months. The European Union must not slow this process down.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in replying to Mr Tusk, having listened to his words this morning, I have to ask him this. In an age when the gap between ordinary voters and the European political class grows wider by the day, just what planet are you on? Why the pretence that everything is going incredibly well?</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is mired in deep structural crisis. Greece, Portugal and Ireland cannot survive inside the euro. The Danes have torn up the Schengen agreement, and good for them, because the total free movement of peoples is a completely irresponsible thing to have done. Public opinion is saying that, whilst they want a European cooperation – yes, of course I agree with that – what they do not want is this Europe, run by unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="en">You say the EU is fantastic in a recent comment. You are supporting the destruction of national democracy. But it is with reference to Greece that I am most concerned about you because, when faced with their recent enslavement, you said: ‘we lived for many years as a non-sovereign country, under Soviet occupation. For us, European integration is not a threat to sovereignty because we experienced not long ago a serious threat to our sovereignty’.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what are you saying? That this is not quite as bad as the USSR? Is that really good enough for your people? And today you describe Greece’s problems as trivial.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry; there are hundreds of thousands of people out there on the streets of Greece fighting to get their democracy back. It beggars belief that you and our President, Mr Buzek, can talk about the Solidarity movement, about Poland getting its democracy back 20 years ago. Yet here you are, surrendering the democracy and sovereignty of Poland to a failed European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, sir. We all want a shared European cooperation for the future, but this most definitely is not the model.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the advent of the Polish Presidency of the Council comes, perhaps, not at a historic moment, but nonetheless at a remarkable point in time for the European Union. The Greek debacle, the Portuguese debacle, all these states of affairs ultimately force us to face the facts. The facts are that European citizens have been lied to in a brazen and shameless fashion for many, many years. Patently falsified financial statistics were allowed to pass, purely and simply in order to move further down the road to a European superstate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is inexcusable. It is inexcusable above all because, as always, it is not those who are really responsible who have to foot the bill, but mainly all the taxpayers of Europe. This patent lying is actually becoming a kind of hallmark of the European Union. When it came to the accession criteria for Bulgaria and Romania, too, we were lied to. When it came to the consequences of Schengen, we were lied to. When it came to the total lack of effective protection of our external borders, we were lied to and today, we are being very actively and brazenly lied to when it comes to the negotiations with Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, once again, we are being told that the Union has just the thing we need, namely, a plan involving enormous euro loans being poured onto the market as if these loans would not have to be paid back by exactly the same taxpayers once again. The plan is to solve government debt due to mismanagement with mismanagement of yet more government debt! It should not surprise anyone any more that more and more people – feeling disdain and lied-to – are turning their backs on this ‘official’ Europe.</p>

The Union would manage easily with each one of them on its own, but this situation is different in that they have come together. However, history shows that Poland copes well in difficult times. The five challenges are the debt crisis, the dismantling of Schengen, the crisis over the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Union’s lack of a military capability and, finally, the crisis of financial solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, in the long term, if we look years ahead, the most important of these is the European Neighbourhood Policy. Without the success of this policy, Europe will neither be safe nor will it enjoy prosperity. We have been surprised by what is happening in the south. We are at an impasse in relation to what is going on in the east, and a fundamental change of paradigm is needed. To misquote an American leader, we ought to say: ‘it’s democracy, stupid’. We need to strengthen the actors of democracy, which is why I hope the flagship of the Polish Presidency, the European Foundation for Democracy, will do well. Transformation to democracy and a market economy are our speciality. I wish you success, Mr Tusk.</p>

We wanted you to talk about the very things to which you did, in fact, refer – believing in Europe, the reason for having a united Europe and the remembrance of history, as well as the contribution of Parliament to the way in which all of these have arisen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Tusk, you have responded to the needs of this House, which are the result, too, of the stance and position of your predecessor and the manner in which he spoke. I just want to stress this very clearly: both you, Mr Tusk, and your predecessor belong to the same political group. We have to assume that within the framework of a single political group, we can have very different presidencies. The memory of which you spoke demands that we stress something very clearly: societies have common aspirations and goals, but they have different political groupings and different governments. In our case, the case of Poland, there is also the Left – it was a left-wing president and a left-wing government which brought Poland into the European Union. Now we can say very clearly that often it is not a matter of the goals of which you spoke. Mr Schulz has expressed great enthusiasm. We do not differ, here, in terms of goals. However, our significant differences can be a matter of the means of achieving those goals. In our case, of the means and the ways of lifting ourselves out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yes, every crisis is different. However, Mr Tusk, two weeks ago, we failed to reach a conclusion on a complete package for the new economic order. We differ, here, on the question as to who is to make most of the sacrifices. The proposals which the majority have prepared – including your political group – come down to this. The citizens have to pay, the people have to make sacrifices. We are opposed to this. We want social solidarity. Sacrifices have to be borne in proportion to ability. So it is important to have a real increase in budgetary incomes. Give your backing to the financial transaction tax. Give your backing, too – the backing of the Council under your leadership and direction – to Eurobonds. We very much like what you said about investment. It is just that we would like words and deeds to go together.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, you have been quoted, Mr Tusk, as saying that the Polish Presidency will primarily be characterised by the way it reacts to crises. It seems to me that your speech today showed that you have more than just crisis management on your agenda. You want to give Europe a direction. I believe this is a good thing, and my fellow Members on all sides of the House have emphasised this. You delivered a great speech. I would like to thank you warmly for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned the debt crisis in Europe, calling for European solidarity. We, in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give our emphatic backing to such solidarity. However, I would remind you of the other side of the coin. For us, this clearly means solidity. It was a lack of solidity and dubious lending policies over many years that led to this crisis. That is why our key demand is for a stability pact that genuinely has teeth. It is ironic that in 2003, the German Chancellor and the French President watered down the Stability and Growth Pact and that the present German Chancellor and French President decided while strolling on the beach in Deauville that the pact for the future should once again be toothless. Mr Tusk, do not let this discourage you! Set to work – as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, the direction is clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second area where I would encourage you to press on boldly is one of the focal points of your Presidency: progressing the common security and defence policy. You will hear some sceptical, reluctant reactions from the capitals of Europe. Do not let this discourage you. The Americans are withdrawing. We have Libya, we have Syria, Eastern Moldova and Georgia – we Europeans have a lot on our collective plate. Strengthen the European External Action Service, promote democracy and human rights, continue to develop security policy instruments and the European Defence Agency. Push for progress in the interest of Europe! There is much to be done. I wish you the best of luck.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, I wanted to speak as we met in your country, in Warsaw, with the delegation from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, when we decided to speak on a number of very specific issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was pointed out, with regard to climate, that the Polish Presidency was somewhat cautious and did not want to make this issue a priority, as the Durban climate change conference is taking place at the end of the year. The European Parliament has very clearly stated the need to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% or even by 30%. Yet, when it comes to environmental safety, I unfortunately do not sense the same will from you as you asserted this morning – which I was pleased to hear – regarding energy security and food security. Environmental security seems to be just as fundamental to me and we will not have one without the other. I think this is a central point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On food security, I would like your Presidency to be more active. Yesterday, the European Parliament said very clearly that countries should have the right to opt out of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately, while we were voting on that, you changed the law in Poland on 1 July to allow GMOs in, under pressure from Mr Barroso. I would like you to enable this procedure in order to ensure that countries have the right to resist, as you have done for many years.</p>

I know that the Polish Presidency of the Council is opposed to an EU financial transaction tax, and, while the EU political elite may not agree with that line, I suspect the citizens of Europe will breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>
      <p sl="en">Poland will understand the dangers of entering into an asymmetrical relationship where Russia holds the whip – and that is precisely the situation in which the EU finds itself at present. To use a football analogy, watching Russia manoeuvring against the EU is like watching Liverpool playing Tranmere Rovers: we all know what the result will be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Poland understands the need to engage with Moldova and Ukraine, two countries that Moscow pulled back into its orbit with ease. Vladimir Putin was once afraid that history would remember him as the man who lost Ukraine. That accolade now goes to President Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, Poland’s record might give us reason for optimism but, on the other hand, I am sorry to say that the Presidency of the Council is now diminished since Herman Van Rompuy and Catherine Ashton took charge of EU foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a final note, the gift you gave us, Mr President of the Council, is very nice but you do not need to give gifts to massively overpaid politicians. Use the money, instead, to give to the poor people in your own country.</p>

I believe that now, in the 21st century, it makes sense to make a concerted effort to address problems that one country cannot resolve on its own and to find a good solution in the interest of our citizens. Thank you very much for your clear expression of commitment in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The tasks facing you in the second half of 2011 are enormous. The key one has already been mentioned, namely, the Greek rescue. I believe that it is right and proper that the European Union should take the lead here, rather than allowing the credit rating agencies to set the pace and direction for our actions. We shall also have to adjust our internal mechanisms if we are to remain capable of action and ensure stability. Unfortunately, Mr Farage has left us, but I would appreciate it if continuous attacks on our common currency from within the European Union would stop, even from those who are not part of the currency union.</p>

You represent a strong and important State in the Baltic region that is able to play a very significant role in European cooperation. However, I will go straight to the point. There is one issue that concerns me and that is climate policy. The Kyoto Agreement expires in six months’ time. It is Poland which, while holding the EU Presidency, will bear the responsibility for whether this climate agreement will be followed by something new or whether it will simply peter out, and that is no trivial matter.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU supports ambitious and realistic climate targets. Ultimately, of course, it is a question of preventing disasters, but it is also a question of linking crisis policy and employment policy with climate policy. It is a question of people’s confidence, as you said yourself in your introduction. The policy needs to take a far-sighted approach. The baton needs to be carried onwards. The challenge for you, Prime Minister, is to drive the EU’s climate policy forwards and not to consign it to oblivion, because this is a serious matter.</p>

It was a very proactive speech, a speech of solidarity, a speech on ‘more Europe’ and therefore we expect a lot – not too much, I hope, but a lot – from your Presidency over the coming months. We expect a great deal from your Presidency in at least three different areas, which I consider essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is obviously the debt crisis, the euro crisis and, in particular, the crisis in countries like Greece. Your Finance Minister spoke of improving our plans to support Greece by making a small change to the philosophy, and I believe that in that respect, he is absolutely right. We should give the Greeks more time. Imagining that they will return to a 3% deficit within two years is obviously unrealistic and is, in addition, counter-productive. We need support plans that will not only call for rigour and seriousness. We must help them to reform their economy, and to prepare future investment, and we must give them some time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is the budget. In this fight on own resources, I know you will be on our side; concerning the interparliamentary conference – which I believe to be absolutely necessary – bringing together states, the European Parliament and national parliaments, I would like to hear more from you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">And finally, on the issue of European defence, you want to develop this area and you want to implement cooperation. I think you are right.

This will only be possible, however, if you and your government respect those values in practice – values such as freedom of speech, freedom of the media and the right of opposition – and not just say nice things about them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is under your government in Poland that journalists have been dismissed from public media in large numbers only because they were critical of the government. It was your government which applied to a court for what would, in fact, have meant the closure of the most prestigious and most often-quoted daily newspaper in Poland – Rzeczpospolita. Why? It was critical of the government. Not long ago, a British shareholder felt forced to sell its shares in the newspaper precisely because of this pressure. Recently too in Poland, special service agents with live firearms entered the flat of a student to intimidate him and seize his computer, just because he was using the Internet to run a website which was critical of the authorities. The Polish Presidency can be a success, but only when you and your government really respect the values of which you spoke so eloquently today. It is time to stop talking and start doing.</p>

We were fighting corruption; and you – who are you fighting? You are fighting Internet users who criticise the authorities. Under our government, the security services did not go at six in the morning to the homes of those who criticised the authorities. They went when a public prosecutor’s office and a court decided they should go, because there was a suspicion of corruption and crime. That is the difference, Mr Siwiec, and that is the difference, Mr Tusk. That would give you a reason, Mr Tusk, for officers entering peoples’ homes at six in the morning, if there were a suspicion of crime or the corruption of people in power.

What you have done over recent days, Mr Tusk, is to criticise the Netherlands and my party, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), as having a eurosceptic attitude. That is really not too bright of you, Mr Tusk, as, over the last seven years, Poland has received no less than EUR 67 billion in European subsidies. I repeat: EUR 67 billion. Mr Tusk, the Dutch have been paying that for you. What is more, more than 100 000 Poles work in the Netherlands and they send their money back to your country, while we get to maintain Poland’s unemployed. Mr Tusk, you should not be criticising the Netherlands, you should be thanking us.</p>

However, this is possible only if the opportunities presented by the Single Market are fully exploited.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must end the uncertainty surrounding economic integration, and quickly. The deeper the integration, the more chance we will have of coming out of the crisis.

      <p sl="it">I believe, however, that the most important contribution to the European project will be made by the Polish Presidency, as a gift to us. It is the contribution of the values of human dignity and dignity at work written on the gates of Gdańsk by the Solidarność militants; it is the contribution of the values of religious freedom and democracy and of the love for one’s people and one’s faith, demonstrated every year for 50 years by the millions of Poles who, in visiting the shrine of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa under the dictatorship, enabled Europe and the entire world to understand the words of the philosopher Józef Tischner, ‘God is born, great powers tremble’; it is the contribution of Karol Wojtyła; it is the contribution of Lech Wałęsa, of Jerzy Popiełuszko, of Bronisław Geremek in this House, and of the Katyn martyrs; and it is the contribution of your history that, in many ways, gives us hope today and makes all of us and all of Europe echo the words of your people: ‘Maria królowa Polski’ [‘Mary, saviour of Poland’].</p>

      <p sl="pl">I think that in the Chamber today, a voice was heard which was not ideological but which is whole-hearted in its commitment to an idea. I think Europe needs such a voice, and I am convinced that you spoke today not only on behalf of your own party and government, but of all Poles, including those who do not support your government, but who support Poland’s place in Europe, want Poland to achieve success and wish you a successful Presidency. For us, of course, a very important matter will be the European solidarity of which you spoke. It is very good that this was emphasised. Our role is to persuade those countries which pay into the European Union budget – and we have to refer to this with respect – but we have to persuade them that the money which is invested in poorer countries is not money wasted. Investment in Poland, investment in our region, is an investment in the prosperity of the whole of the European Union, and that solidarity has a very pragmatic aspect, including for those from whom we do, of course, expect that money, because they are richer.</p>

While the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again reminded us of and illustrated the difficulties the European Union faces in existing as such, in the international arena, we are pleased that the Polish Presidency has the courage to take on this debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It should be emphatically noted that the common security and defence policy is not a secondary option, but rather it is a necessity. It is, firstly, an aim which is enshrined in the Treaty and is thus binding on the Member States and European institutions. It is also a strategic necessity; every day, with all the crises and threats all around us, we are finding that our US friends and allies cannot and do not want to do everything on our behalf. Lastly, it is an economic imperative at a time of budgetary restraint. Defence has a cost which many of our citizens consider exorbitant. To maintain our defence capabilities, as well as our industries, our expertise and our jobs, we must collectively streamline our defence budgets. The Member States must accept their responsibilities, but the European Union institutions – and I am thinking here of the High Representative and the External Action Service – should function more as a source of initiatives, and we are counting on the Polish Presidency to stimulate these initiatives.</p>

It will be over the next six months that the legislative proposals that will govern the common agricultural policy (CAP) during the next financial programming period will be revealed, and it will also be under the Polish Presidency that negotiations for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will start.

That said, however, I should like to ask Mr Tusk and the Polish Presidency to pay particular attention to policies on economic integration, economic governance and supervision of financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that, as it stands, no matter how ambitious our targets in the plan on – let us say – defence, energy, food security, the environment, agriculture, or multiannual financial frameworks, we will not have a Europe that is strong enough to tackle the challenges faced by the Polish Presidency unless the global markets see a clear and robust solution to the European debt crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I would draw attention to the fact that it is crucial to convince the other Heads of State or Government that there is a need for more economic integration and more economic governance in the European Union. Without it, what will happen is that, instead of controlling European interests, or at least being the representatives of our peoples, we in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission will only be reacting purely to the movements of the credit rating agencies.</p>

If the association agreement with Ukraine is initialled by the end of this year, there is a chance it will be translated next year and, following translation, signed by the partner countries. If it is signed, it might be ratified before the elections in Ukraine in 2012. It could then be ratified in the European Parliament in 2013 and become a fact. If the agreement is not initialled in this half-year at the EU-Ukraine Summit, it will simply evaporate. This is not just a question of a two- or three-month delay. So I would like to say, Mr Tusk, that you have an exceptional opportunity at the Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw to point the way to a new driving force for Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern policy.

Its absence strengthens the forces of risk and the forces of speculation in European markets, and in situations such as we have with Greece, its absence makes us aware of how urgent it is that work on this legislation be completed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Agreement on this is needed, too, for the health of the European economy and the perspective of its growth in the long term, as well as for a return to normal market conditions of a lower degree of uncertainty, which will favour the investment which is so much needed in Europe. Finally, good structures of economic governance are also an essential condition for further enlargement of the euro area. Without agreement on this, we will hinder convergence processes and weaken perspectives for the accession of new Member States, and we must not allow this. Therefore, Mr Tusk, we are counting greatly on the work of Poland’s superb Minister for Finance, but also on your own personal involvement, in finding a compromise. This is a case when time is against us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, your speech fills us with hope, the hope that the Polish Presidency will help combat the Europe of national selfishness, which fails to look to the future, and will help further a Europe that genuinely thinks of itself as being real, integrated and sharing a common destiny.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, as you rightly said in your speech, presidencies have specific problems to tackle and solve. In the short time that I have, I wish to draw your attention to two crucial issues relating to the economic and financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first issue concerns the reform of the financial markets. This is not a technical problem but a major democratic issue of our time. Too much time is being taken: we need to settle issues such as the one relating to the reform of short selling and over-the-counter derivatives. The second issue is that we have the matter of the tax on financial transactions to address; we need to look at this issue in detail, and we hope that the Polish Presidency will make a real contribution in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next year, we are going to mark the 50th anniversary of the operation of the common agricultural policy – a policy which, pursuant to the provisions of the Treaties of Rome, was to ensure access to food for all, at affordable prices and providing just incomes for farmers. The first two objectives have been achieved, but the third has not.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The incomes of farmers in Europe amount to 55% of those of other occupational groups. We attach great importance to cohesion policy, but this also requires cohesion of rural and urban areas, the elimination of disparities in standards of living and the reduction of gaps in terms of development. Young people must not be allowed to leave agriculture. The common agricultural policy benefits the environment and produces public goods for which farmers are not otherwise paid.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In WTO negotiations, the Union is making too many concessions at the cost of agriculture. Food security requires strong supervisory services at national level, and not services which are spread out across the regions and are not very effective. European farmers, including Polish ones, expect higher incomes, which they deserve for their hard work. We need to invest in Europe. We need a strong budget for cohesion policy, the CAP and innovation. We must manage Europe wisely and soundly. I am certain that Poland is ready to do this.</p>

I would like to say a word to Mr Ziobro, but I see he is not now present in the Chamber – as usual, by the way; Mr Ziobro, that is no way to behave. Now, I would like to turn to the priorities of the Presidency. Mr Tusk, I speak not only on behalf of Poles, but of many of the European Union’s citizens. Yes, we very much want to help you achieve an open Europe, a Europe without internal borders, but one which has strongly guarded external borders. These objectives can be achieved by strengthening Frontex, and they can be achieved by putting a stop to the dangerous move towards revision of the Schengen agreement. We wish you well, and we who sit in this House – and not just the Poles – can be counted on to help.</p>

We must prove that the enlargement of the European Union has been a success, and that new Member States can also make the policy of the European Union successful. In the first half of 2011, it was Hungary, and now it is Poland that has to prove this. However, this requires that we also treat the disability issue as a priority. This was treated as a special issue under the previous trio of presidencies. The disability issue has been treated as a high priority in the past year: the 10-year disability strategy was adopted, including the European Commission’s respective conclusions, and my report will be approved in September.</p>

I hope that Mr Tusk will talk to Mr Barroso and arrange for these files to be forwarded as quickly as possible, and that the Polish Presidency will bring the procedure to a successful conclusion. I would also hope, Mr Tusk, that we will return to something which is very much expected here – the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Poland is the only Member State which has not ratified the Charter.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, as a Pole, I would like the Polish Presidency to be a success, but an effective Presidency is one which is able to incorporate national interests into European objectives. The German Presidency completed work on the Treaty of Lisbon, but it just so happens that it is Germany which, as the country with the highest population, is the greatest beneficiary of the change from Nice to double majority voting. The French Presidency completed the climate package, but it so happens that it is France which will earn the most from sales of alternative energy technologies when the package comes into force.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Tusk, please look at the way these powers have behaved and learn the lessons from it. You have, today, an opportunity for Poland. You hold the Presidency of the European Council, and you have the President of the European Parliament. Why do you not have the courage to take up matters which, if continued in their present form, will ruin part of Europe, including Poland? Why is it that Polish farmers are to be given an annual subsidy per hectare which is EUR 150 lower than German farmers will be receiving, which means that rural areas in Poland are to lose tens of billions of euro? Why will you not initiate a rethink of the climate package, because the package will ruin the Polish economy and mean that in a short space of time, electricity prices will rise by 100%? Mr Tusk, you have your opportunity. History will judge you not by your fine words, but by what you do for people.</p>

You already know, from the many speeches of my fellow Members, all that the European Parliament expects from you. It will certainly be no easy task to fulfil all of these wishes. I would like to draw your attention to just two areas where Poland has more power and more of the prerequisites for a successful solution than other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The first area is that of relations between the EU and Ukraine. The traditionally good relations between Poland and its neighbours may help draw Ukraine closer to European political culture, and thus improve partnership cooperation with this important neighbour of the EU. I firmly believe that the citizens of both Ukraine and the EU can profit from improved economic and political relations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The second area is European agricultural policy, in which the new Member States have still not achieved the same rights as the old Member States.

On the one hand, the latter means independence, while on the other hand, we should take every opportunity to invest in renewable energies, thereby reducing unemployment and offering more training opportunities for young people.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will make some brief remarks, summarising a debate that I believe was very interesting.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, Prime Minister Tusk, you have seen a remarkable consensus from the main political forces of this Parliament – what I consider to be the pro-European, responsible forces – supporting your speech and your vision. At the same time, it is interesting that we heard more than usually aggressive remarks from the Eurosceptic or Europhobe fringes. Remarks were made here today which were very close to racism; we also heard xenophobic messages and some expressions of naked, shameless nationalism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why should this be? I think the reason is the following. Some of those Eurosceptics and Europhobes were expecting the enlargement of the European Union to mean disintegration, and now they are very disappointed to see Poland, a new member of the Union, saying not only that we need to enlarge but also that we need to deepen Europe, and to listen to your commitment to, and your conviction in, the European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, Prime Minister Tusk, congratulations. Today, you have disappointed the Eurosceptics and Europhobes – that is one of the outcomes of this debate.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">What basically is their message, if they have one, apart from ‘no’? For simply saying ‘no’ to anything constructive is the simplest demagogic message of all populism. Their message is that, although they are not necessarily against Europe and they believe in European cooperation, they do not need the European institutions, the Commission or the European Parliament. What they say we need is an internal market: we need a Single Market. So they say ‘yes’ to the freedom of circulation of goods but ‘no’ to the circulation of people – as if it were possible in Europe to have a market without these indispensable principles of freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know well, from the experience we now have – and you know well, Prime Minister, because we have worked very closely on some difficult issues – that without strong institutions in Europe, without a strong Commission, a strong European Court of Justice and a strong European Parliament, even the Single Market will be at risk. The temptation will be present to break the Single Market, to have internal protectionism, and to return to the naked nationalism that made a disaster of Europe’s past. That is why it is important today to reaffirm, as you have reaffirmed, our values. Those values are, of course, about an internal Single Market and about opening our borders, but they are also about solidarity and cohesion, because without solidarity, a union cannot exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of the Eurosceptics say that they are for Europe but that they are against the European Union. What an interesting nuance! If you go to Washington, Moscow or Beijing, you will find they do not make that distinction: it is Europe or it is the European Union. It is basically the same thing. If the European Union fails, all of Europe will be put at risk. That is why we need a strong European Union to protect our interests and to protect our values.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister Tusk, the message you conveyed to this Parliament today was a message of confidence in our common future in Europe and in the world. We are grateful to you for that and we want to encourage you to have a successful Presidency of the Council. The Commission will support your work because I know that is the way we can build a better future for all Europeans.</p>

    <intervention id="3-072-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Donald Tusk" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, firstly I must, of course, begin by thanking you for your words, both for those words which were unequivocal in their support for the vision of our affairs which I presented, but also for all the other contributions; they expressed a little less enthusiasm, but they confirmed the purpose of this debate; they confirmed the reason for having the European Parliament and they confirmed the belief of even the most sceptical in this Chamber that we built this building precisely so that in it we could exchange our views, and that includes our views on the future of Europe. Thank you very much, too, for those words which – as someone here rightly noted – were compliments. They were compliments which were, I think, meant more for my country than for me personally.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Even if we do sometimes hear the sceptical voices of Poles here, in my country today, the level of clear support for Europe is impressive. We have often boasted about this, but then it is something which is worth mentioning repeatedly. After several years of membership, which have been good but not at all easy years, over 80% of Poles are very satisfied with the fact that we are in the European Union. That energy and belief in the reason for our work is something I wanted to convey here. I am not the source of this belief. I am, today, only someone who is reporting the fact that there is a nation in Europe which almost in its entirety believes in the Europe we have in common.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Perhaps I did not speak very precisely about a certain initiative of which you reminded me here; an initiative which is also going to provide practical confirmation of my conviction that working with Parliament is not just a matter of ingratiation. We are not talking about working together because this is what we are supposed to say in Parliament. It really is our conviction that since we do want more integration, but do not want bureaucratisation or poor practice, we must involve the European Parliament and national parliaments in the most important debates. This is why we have proposed holding a conference in the autumn on the future of European finance, an open debate in which Parliament and representatives of national parliaments will play a leading role. Naturally, the Commission and the Council will also take part in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are convinced that to speak with courage and without hypocrisy about the future of Europe, we must also speak about the future of European money. We hope the conference will confirm this. It is also only a sign of things to come, because we would like this open debate to become something permanent in the future. We would also like to make intensive efforts for calm and constructive debate about the budget. I have not concealed this intention; we want to protect the European budget from measures which could reduce Europe’s ability to work as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We talked a lot about Schengen in the context of two matters which were mentioned: the Danish decisions and the dreams or expectations of Romania and Bulgaria in relation to joining the Schengen area as soon as possible. As for the actions of Denmark, but also as for some statements which have been made recently by the European Council, I am a vigorous opponent of any kind of restriction on internal movement under the pretext of problems over migration, and am more in favour of strengthening external borders. Recent Danish actions may cause us concern, because they can be seen as a further signal that full freedom of movement around the European Union may be threatened in the future. As we also heard here, freedom of movement in the European Union is being treated as a curse and not a blessing. Therefore, in my opinion, we should work with the Commission to find measures which will guarantee the free movement of people and, at the same time, protect Europe from the adverse effects of illegal migration or other similar circumstances. As for Romania and Bulgaria: every Member State of the European Union which meets the technical and organisational requirements for being in the Schengen area – as do Romania and Bulgaria, and this has been confirmed, too, by the Commission – should be in Schengen. We establish requirements, conditions and criteria so that countries which meet them can benefit from this basic principle.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It was asked here if the Presidency is going to work for policy which benefits the entire Union, so that joint decisions are not made under the dictates of the largest Member States. However, there were also voices which questioned the need to strengthen the European institutions. We have to make up our mind about this. No one, I suppose, wants a situation in which one, two or three Member States impose their selfish point of view on anyone because of their strength. We built the European institutions – and even after Lisbon there is still a rotating Presidency – so that the different potentials of Member States can be evened out by Union policy, but for this we need strong institutions. It will be our ambition to direct the work of the European Union by acting in conjunction with others, so that everyone will feel they are equally empowered participants. However, this will only be possible when we stop questioning such institutions as the European Commission and instead believe in the reason for strengthening them. It is then that we will have the tools for putting Union policy into effect. If we do really want to have policy which works for the whole Union, we must have strong Union institutions – the Commission, Parliament and others – otherwise we are deceiving ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also want to reassure everyone about what was said during the debate by several Polish Members of the House. The date of parliamentary elections in Poland is, in fact, set by the constitution. The government has nothing to do with choosing the date of elections. Elections in Poland are held on a date which is determined by the constitution. It is not very good that the elections will be held during the Presidency, but we will take care that these two situations do not conflict with each other. No motion was tabled in the Polish Parliament for an early dissolution. I think it is better to have democratic government which keeps to constitutional dates than an executive which makes use of any pretext to shorten or extend a term of office. That is what happened, for example, in Poland in the case of my predecessors, who shortened their term of office. It was in fact they who decided that our Presidency would coincide with the elections, and not I.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is our ambition to support negotiations with Ukraine on association and increased trade. I was in Kiev several months ago, and I think that I made known my intention very clearly – as Prime Minister of a government which was soon to hold the Presidency – to make use of what is currently the best possible climate for Ukraine and the European Union in terms of the association agreement. This requires great effort from Ukraine, because by entering into the association agreement, it is Ukraine which will have to respect our common principles. I think that everything is going extremely well. I do agree that this is precisely the moment at which, while respecting all the rules and not just making things easier, we should dot the next i for Ukraine – and also for other countries. I am certain that during these six months, the progress made in a number of negotiations will be satisfactory. I will do everything to ensure that this will be the case.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I know that a priority – and a permanent one – for a significant part of this House are ecological matters, and that this includes climate in particular. However, when I have met with you in different places, I have never been dishonest with any of you. My, or rather, the Polish point of view is perhaps not sufficiently enthusiastic to achieve full approval from the pro-climate or pro-ecological avant-garde. I want to assure everyone that I do understand very well the difference between forcing national interest during various negotiations carried out under the banner of the European Union and holding the Presidency, and with the best will and with the help of all the available tools and my own personal skills, I will work on behalf of Europe, and that includes preparation for Durban. I am certain we will find a solution which will not harm Europe in her ambitions for growth and development and which will also respect our current mutual obligations and arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In closing, I know I have not answered all the questions and have not responded to everything that was said. I have not lectured anyone here, Mr President, and I certainly am not going to do so. That is not my role, and I would not risk doing anything so reckless. However, there were some questions or statements to which, in my opinion, we should not respond emotionally, because statements which go as far as to be humiliating to every true European, or which strike at the fundamental principles of the equality of every human being, irrespective of race, nationality or place of birth, I understand as discrediting those who make them, and not the nations referred to in them.</p>

I would like to draw attention to the fact that it is time to clear the way for the directive on maternity leave, which was rejected by most Member States, not to mention the uncertain outlook for the Anti-Discrimination Directive, which is still blocked in the Council. These laws are very relevant to all people in Europe and consequently, their future must be decided as quickly as possible. Furthermore, I would urge the Council Presidency to pay more attention to the modernisation of higher education, which has an impact on youth employment. I am pleased that Poland’s programme provides for debates on the high level of unemployment in Europe, particularly unemployment among older people. However, at the same time, I would like to call on the Council Presidency to not only organise seminars and conferences on these important issues, but also to take concrete action regarding employment opportunities for young and old alike. So I wish Poland a successful Presidency in the coming six months, improving the situation for European citizens and safeguarding their rights and freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="de">Poland joined the EU seven years and two months ago and we are pleased to see it take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

We therefore doubly welcome the fact that Poland also intends pursuing ambitious goals in transport policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We Social Democrats welcome the fact that you intend to promote the improvement of social conditions for workers in the transport sector.

      <p sl="pt">The EU is experiencing a ‘moment’ of tension and uncertainty, exacerbated by the fact that we have timid European leaders and a growing wave of populism and nationalism. The crisis of the euro and the return of borders in Denmark are evidence of this ‘moment’. The Polish Presidency has a crucial role, and it is to be hoped that it will contribute to the return of economic growth, to genuine solidarity, and to the stability of the euro. I am convinced that either we will overcome this ‘moment’ with more Europe, making progress with European integration, or we will move backwards and sink.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The role of the Polish Presidency is also crucial to the success of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. The issue of new own resources is crucial in this area. The majority in Parliament is in favour of this issue. Given the need for unanimity in the Council on adopting the new MFF and on new resources, and given the current ‘moment’, it is no easy task. We need the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy to be achieved, which will require a budget that will cover it, and economic governance that is robust and convergent. However, I put my trust in the Polish Presidency, and hope it will be successful.</p>

      <p sl="pl">When listening to the statements of leading Polish politicians, I come to the conclusion that their approach to the Polish Presidency is in the ‘romantic’ tradition, something which is very strongly rooted in our mentality, and that the time has come for an increasingly self-confident Poland to ‘renew’ an old and unassured Europe. However, unlike the romantic poets, we are thinking not of spiritual, but primarily of economic renewal. The challenges facing Poland are very difficult – the crisis in the euro area, the need to give support to Greece, the Schengen question – and they may also lead to changes in many of the Polish Presidency’s priorities. The European press is not writing about the Eastern Partnership or the Instrument for Democracy today, but about Greece, Libya and the Schengen area, and this clearly establishes the direction of work for the next six months. At the same time, I do think Poland is a credible leader of the Union for this time of crisis: we ourselves have experienced economic reforms which meant we had to tighten our belts. We have shown, too, that such reforms are worthwhile. Therefore, I think Poland’s leadership of the Union can help improve the EU’s credibility in the international arena and so can also help ease the economic crisis. I hope this will bring Poland satisfaction at a job well done, and also that it will contribute to the creation of a new image of our country as a credible partner for difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Hungary has passed the torch not only to another Member State, but to a friendly country at the helm of the EU. Poland embarks upon the challenge-filled six months ahead of us with an ambitious Presidency Programme worthy of our support. I agree with the Polish Prime Minister, who, in his initial statements, warned of the dangers of a ‘new Euroscepticism’. We know leading politicians in Brussels who claim to be committed believers in integration, while at home they make radically different decisions and statements. Similar to Donald Tusk, I am also worried about the doublespeak and the intent to aggressively promote national interests at the expense of EU interests. I greatly appreciate that after failed initiatives, the Polish Government finally wants to add momentum to the efforts aimed at establishing closer relationships with our Eastern neighbours, and that the continuation of the enlargement process and the achievement of energy safety are among its priority objectives. Contrary to its predecessor, Poland was successful in obtaining observer status for its Minister for Finance at Euro Group meetings, which I find particularly important for strengthening coordination between Member States inside and outside of the monetary union. I also welcome the fact that the Polish Government is organising a conference on the long-term EU budget, involving all affected parties, including the European Parliament. I hope that the autumn parliamentary elections in Poland will not impact the activities of the current Presidency. We know from experience the disadvantages that can come from domestic political events overshadowing the work of the Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Poland is assuming the EU Presidency during a difficult period: the post-Lisbon institution system is still taking shape, and we must also find a satisfactory solution to control the effects of the crisis. It is good news that the Presidency Programme of the Poland-Denmark-Cyprus Trio is devoting special attention to gender equality issues even under these challenging circumstances. The programme states that in strategies aiming for economic growth and welfare, it is crucial that the basic principle of equal opportunity prevails. It also names specific issues (such as harmonisation of work and family life, the employment and education status of women, maternity leave, and violence against women) where the presidencies intend to make progress. However, it is important that in addition to the above, the Presidency also pays attention to adopting a horizontal equal opportunity approach that extends to all policy areas. With regard to the chapter of the Presidency Trio’s programme on poverty, I would like to ask whether the Presidency intends to give high priority to the situation of female pensioners who are at the greatest risk of becoming impoverished. I also hope that the Presidency undertakes all necessary efforts to successfully conclude negotiations on the Maternity Leave Directive, because so far, the proposal has not been accepted due to opposition from Member States. I am very pleased that the Polish Presidency intends to operate as an integrating Presidency, as this is something greatly needed in Europe today.

      <p sl="pl">The programme of the Polish Presidency of the Council is an ambitious plan for Europe. I am pleased that it has met with such broad support in the European Parliament, and I am not surprised by this support, because it stems from the fact that the Polish Presidency’s programme is one which is outstandingly pro-European. The decided majority of fellow Members are in favour of solidarity, the Single Market, the free movement of people, openness, and the military, food and energy security of Europe, so this support for the Polish Presidency is not just the result of a friendly attitude, but is also based on the views which we have in common. However, one can only say that the behaviour of the xenophobes and Europhobes is shocking. This exotic coalition has been joined by fellow Members from the Polish Law and Justice party. I regret, too, that fellow Members who support Law and Justice used today’s debate to spread their deceitful ideas and conduct an election campaign. Shame on you gentlemen, shame! It has also come to light that these supporters of Law and Justice are not familiar with the Polish constitution. It was not the present government or the Prime Minister who decided the date of the parliamentary elections which are to be held this year. The date of elections is determined by the provisions of the constitution. If, then, there is someone who is responsible for the fact that the elections are to be held half-way through the Polish Presidency, that someone is Jarosław Kaczyński. It was Mr Kaczyński who brought about a shortening of the term of the Sejm in 2007. No motion was tabled for a shortening of the present term. Fortunately, Europe knows who is telling lies about this. It is just a pity that we are wasting time on trivial matters.</p>

Most of these fears did not materialise, and the negative stereotypes have given way to new opinions. Polish business has adapted to the new rules of play, and our economy has developed rapidly in comparison with the crisis-ridden countries of Europe. This was possible in part thanks to European funds, which we have used in the development of our regions. Great credit here is due to local governments, which have become a strong institution and have provided stability to democracy. Poland is, today, an important Member State of the EU and its voice is respected, and it is also an important country for the Union because Poland is among the most pro-European of societies. The Polish Government should give expression to these attitudes during the Presidency. The Union, which has been shaken by different kinds of crisis, needs leadership which will call attention to European values and work for a cohesive and strong Union.</p>

It is the Polish Presidency which will begin negotiations on the financial framework after 2013. In this context, as a member of the parliamentary Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to call the Presidency’s particular attention to youth programmes and the sport programme. It is important that budget cuts made because of the crisis do not affect the EU’s strategy for youth. It is essential to have the right support for the Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, as well as the Erasmus Mundus programme, which has not yet been fully implemented. As the country holding the Presidency when the European sport programme is introduced, Poland will be able to influence the form taken by the programme. I would ask for consideration to be given to the written statement I drafted and which the European Parliament has adopted on increased support for grassroots sports. Furthermore, as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I deplore the fact that the Presidency, despite my letters, does not intend to continue work on combating violence against women or on the proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Such proposals are contained in the 18-month programme of the next three presidencies (Poland, Denmark, Cyprus) and work on them has already been initiated by the Spanish Presidency.</p>

You mentioned the past, knowledge of which is essential for thinking in perspectives. Throughout its history, as well as during the current economic crisis, Poland has often provided examples of how to take control of difficult situations. As a Hungarian from Transylvania, I would like to emphasise the role of our common ruler, István Báthory, in stabilising the region. It was a pleasure to read amongst the Polish priorities that you intend to continue the enlargement process in an ‘open European spirit’, that you would like to help complete the democratic transition of the North African states, that you emphasise the acceleration of economic growth, and attribute importance to securing basic rights and protecting minorities as well as to the facilitation of the free movement of persons. I am convinced that Europe must show this open side, as opposed to the inward and dismissive one that fearfully peeks out from behind the Schengen borders.

Without doubt, the Polish Presidency has many challenges to face in its six-month term of office, the most important being the start of negotiations on the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The initial impression we have gleaned is positive in terms of the importance being accorded by the Polish Presidency to the role of the cohesion policy in the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. It is important that the Presidency acknowledges that the cohesion policy must continue to spearhead action by the EU to generate more and more targeted investments to combat the economic crisis. Also, within the context of negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, one important parameter is the adoption of the legislative package for the cohesion policy post-2013. We hope that negotiations will progress to the maximum during the Polish Presidency.

At the strategic level, the incoming Presidency is stressing the new areas of the Treaty of Lisbon, the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and the recent proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. I welcome the references to cohesion policy as one of the most important areas of European policy, and to its links to the Europe 2020 strategy’s aims of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The programme mentions ‘European integration as a source of growth’, and I welcome the proposals to deepen the internal market, in line with the European Commission’s proposals in the ‘Single Market Act’, in which small and medium-sized enterprises, training and research are not forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the context of the negotiations on the legislative package on post-2013 cohesion policy, the Polish Presidency will have to demonstrate its firm commitment to achieving a good result in late 2012.

In this unfavourable climate, the Polish Government has made it a priority to press on regardless and take steps intended to improve the competitiveness of the EU economy and to ease the crisis.

Poland is bold in declaring that Europe’s problems can be resolved with stronger integration and not by renationalising policies, and with greater solidarity and not with national chauvinism. This is why the Polish Presidency will have a strong ally in the European Parliament. As Chair of the Eastern Partnership’s Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, I can confidently state that Poland will be able to give new impetus to the European Union’s relations with its neighbours, both in the southern Mediterranean and in the east. The next Eastern Partnership summit is scheduled to take place in Warsaw. I expect achievable, yet fairly ambitious objectives to be outlined there.

I am all the more hopeful that this topic will appear in the elaboration of the Polish Presidency’s economic priorities. Security will also be an important topic in the forthcoming period – not only economic security, but also energy and military security, including better protection for the external borders of the Schengen area. This is linked to the continuation of talks on EU expansion into the Balkans.

      <p sl="unknown">All of the speeches are running seriously behind schedule, so I urge you to keep to the speaking time that you have been given.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after 20 months of work, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis is about to bring its work to an end, and yet the crisis is not over. I would like to take this opportunity to really thank my colleagues and to acknowledge the collective work that we have been able to achieve and the confidence you have placed in me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are concluding our work at a time when the economic governance package is stalled, at a time when the financial markets have once again taken up many of their bad habits, including in terms of the distribution of bonuses, and at a time when the fate of Member States depends on the ratings they are given by the credit rating agencies. It is a difficult environment, and that is why we are asking you, Commissioner, to conduct a public debt audit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this report, I believe we have fulfilled our mandate. We say that we need more Europe. This message may sound odd in some capitals as we now feel that the capitals are wary of Europe, precisely because it has sometimes appeared to act too late and do too little.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We say that we need this integration. Commissioner, eight months ago, in October 2010, we suggested here that you bring in a tax on financial transactions across Europe. Eight months later, you have implemented this. Eight months ago, we also suggested that you appointed a ‘Mr Euro’, and now Jean-Claude Trichet is suggesting a finance minister, although the mandate he has set for this role is not as we would have liked it to be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hear us out, then, and do not wait any longer; implement the other proposals we are making, like our suggestion to mutualise the debt. In the Greek case, we were told that there would be ‘no aid to Greece’, and then we proceeded to help Greece. We were told ‘no permanent mechanism’, and yet the mechanism will become permanent. Today, therefore, we are saying to you, ‘Go further and mutualise the debt. Set up a public rating agency, set up a European Treasury’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Internationally, we need Europe, of course, to speak with one voice. We need to establish real European economic governance. This entails integrating the Bretton Woods institutions and the G20 into the United Nations system; it also means fighting to ensure that, in terms of international commerce, we have fair trade based on reciprocity. It also requires the European Union to pursue consistent policies and not, as here, adopt ambitious targets without a framework for the Europe 2020 strategy or, moreover, develop austerity plans that prevent us from carrying out what we believe to be our strategy to end the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To that end, in this report, we indeed suggest you follow the golden rule for spending on education; we propose that you finally establish the European Energy Community, which will bring to life the concept of solidarity among us. We also propose that you finally look into the issue of corporate governance. What are you waiting for to make our businesses, which call themselves socially responsible, accountable for these social and environmental responsibilities?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the area of ​economic governance, we are aware that we need to do more in terms of supervision, and we invite you to look at what an optimum allocation of capital is. Today, you want the financial markets to be stable once again. That is not enough, given that stability in the financial markets was supposedly the situation we were in before August 2007, and we have seen where that got us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Behind stability, we must also look at where the capital is going and how it is being used because this is not an industry. It is a service which exists to serve industry; it is precisely this paradox that you must resolve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, we ask you to look at business models in the banking sector, as there is perhaps also work to be done in that area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to do all this, we will need a larger budget, and we can tell you that if, together, we fail to carry out the revision of the Treaties that needs to happen, each of us in the euro area must accept our responsibility and move forward through enhanced cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We hope we can move forward together on this path that we are suggesting to you and which appears to be a new deal for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to congratulate Mrs Berès on drafting an excellent report. It is a very important report, and one which is indeed apposite at this juncture. The financial crisis has turned into a crisis of public finances, and the fight against it is what is most important for Europe today. This is why I very much welcome the report, and this is why I say it is so important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have before us, today, our most important short-term challenge, that of reconciling our positions on the package of six legal acts on economic governance. I think that between the position of the Council and that of Parliament, there are still two or three areas of disagreement. I hope we will quickly be able to find the compromise we are looking for – I hope so, but I am not sure – but I do think it is extremely important for us to achieve that compromise quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The package is truly groundbreaking: we are going to place greater emphasis on, and attach greater importance to, public debt and not just deficits, and we are going to introduce country-specific rules on public debt – whether deficits or increases in public spending. This is something which we have had in Poland for some time now, and is what will now be required, on the basis of this package, in all Member States. It includes a very significant reinforcement of the preventative arm, perhaps the most important reinforcement of this arm of our system of economic governance, and there is also to be an EU spending rule.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Naturally, everything in the six acts of the package is very important, but we must also ensure economic growth – something which the package, of course, does not do – because, as Mr Tusk said here a few minutes ago, solidarity is not charity. Of course, we must ensure this economic growth mainly by structural reforms and privatisation, but we must have aid programmes which ensure not only consolidation of public finances, but which also make economic growth possible. Solidarity, which is not charity, is something which is in the best interest of countries which play in the same team. This is precisely what we have to regain – the understanding that the stability of the euro area is crucial, too, for those countries which give help to others, and not just for those which receive that help, and that programmes for structural reform, consolidation of public finances and also privatisation are in the best interest of the countries which adopt those programmes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of this, I am certain that on the principle of a rightly understood concept of solidarity, we will be able – and this will also be thanks to the report we are going to discuss today – to overcome the growing divide between the north and the south of Europe, between the more stable countries, which are helping the others, and those which are receiving that help. We must, however, remember, as Mr Tusk said a few minutes ago, that solidarity is worthwhile because those who receive expressions of solidarity from others who are, at that time, stronger, can later repay that solidarity and give back even more.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would just like to end by expressing my great satisfaction at the fact that Christine Lagarde, the former French Minister for Finance, has become Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. I think she will play a key role in the forum of the G20, too, in terms of taking Europe’s proposals further there. As representative of the Presidency, I am going to listen with great attention to the comments of the European Parliament. I would also like to congratulate Mrs Berès again on this Committee’s report.</p>

The scope of your work has been enormous, but your method of tackling it has been similarly impressive, resulting in a thorough analysis and a broad set of conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although this final report represents the completion of the committee’s mandate, it will be important to ensure that its work receives the appropriate follow-up. From the Commission’s side, I can assure you that we will pay very close attention to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, I cannot comment here in detail on every one of the 108 paragraphs, but let me make some general remarks. First of all, we continue to be primarily preoccupied with the urgent measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis because we are, of course, not out of the woods yet. We are working to put public finances back on a sound footing and to address the extraordinary challenges presented by the situation in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we need to put in place an institutional and legislative framework which will prevent a repetition of the events of the last three years. In this context, let me thank all those who have worked intelligently and hard on the economic governance package over the past year. I can only regret that the Council and Parliament have not yet been able to reach a final agreement on it. The conclusion of the governance reform is badly needed to show that Europe has the capacity to act, and thus to restore confidence in our economic prospects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The adoption of the package is fundamental to our response to the crisis: to strengthening and giving teeth to our economic policy coordination, in terms of both prevention and correction; to achieving sound public finances; and to avoiding harmful macro-economic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">I firmly believe that 99% of this package has been agreed. The Council and Parliament have both made important improvements to our original proposals. Parliament has, for instance, codified the European Semester and set up a structured economic dialogue, providing for a prominent role for Parliament throughout the European Semester. It has created the opportunity for detailed discussion of country-specific situations at every stage of decision making, and it has obtained a commitment from the Commission to carry out a study on eurosecurities within six months of the entry into force of the legislation. The Commission will also commit itself, in the declaration accompanying the study, to reviewing the intergovernmental nature of the European Stabilisation Mechanism by mid-2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, you have won an equal role for Parliament in determining the scoreboard for detecting possible macro-economic imbalances. You have inserted firm guarantees on social dialogue, respect for national traditions in relation to collective agreements, wage formation and the role of social partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet it seems that this is not sufficient, and therefore it is not possible to conclude the legislative process before the summer break. That is very disappointing. I hope that the Council and Parliament will pull out all the stops to reach an acceptable compromise on the issues that still divide them, so that this package can enter into force as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking beyond the vote, I welcome the ambition and scope of the vision outlined in the report. I share the view that we must look further ahead and focus on the long-term implications of the crisis for the European project. I assume that a clear majority of all of us here agree that deeper economic integration will have to be part of the answer, despite current trends that appear to go in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding your call for the Commission to present a report on Eurobonds, in the context of the economic governance package, the Commission has agreed to table such a report on the feasibility of eurosecurities towards the end of the year. These eurosecurities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability, as well as ensuring, by taking advantage of the increase in liquidity, that Member States enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates. This issue really has to be seen as part of the overall governance reform that will materialise through the adoption of the package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate your support for improving the European Union’s role as a global player in the context of the G20, the IMF and other elements of global governance. I am also glad that you have paid particular attention in your report to the issues of competitiveness and convergence, and sustainable growth and jobs. The paramount importance of growth policies cannot be overstated in relation to tackling the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I trust the Commission and Parliament share the view that a convincing response to this crisis and the effective prevention of future crises will require stronger, broader and earlier coordination at European level. This is at the heart of the economic governance package. In my view, the first concrete reaction to the final report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as prepared by Ms Berès, must be the speediest possible adoption of the package. It does not yet mean completion of the economic and monetary union but it is certainly a very big step in that direction – and it is essential to restore confidence in the European project of deeper integration and an ever-closer union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report will be debated and decided upon, and the public debt crisis will keep us busy for years to come, as will the appraisal of the causes of the crisis. In this report, we have done what we set out to do, looking at the bigger picture, developing long-term perspectives, breaking down barriers, whether based in party politics, routine policies or populist agendas, or even day-to-day political issues. That is the job we took on and that is also the job we have done.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether or not the Council and the Commission support this report, the fact is that Parliament will make its own decision. We could actually start working on the implementation of the report tomorrow. The sooner these objectives become a reality, the sooner we can learn lessons from the crisis. I welcome the fact that this report is being debated following the speech by Prime Minister Tusk. After all, this report is simply the implementation of his appeal for more Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do indeed need more Europe, because we do not have enough Europe in economic policy, taxation policy, budgetary policy, social policy, education policy, research policy, foreign policy, energy policy or defence policy. It is true that we have an imbalance between competition policy and social policy, between the internal market and taxation policy, between the euro area and economic policy. The fact is that, on many issues that relate to the internal market, the role of Europe in the world and the euro area, we seem to have precariously one-sided policies, something that has contributed to the crises, and that is one of our greatest problems in overcoming the crises. We need more European Union, more Europe, and more Europe on the world stage. To spell it out, we need to take the next step towards integration. We need an economic and social convention. We need an economic and social union as an interim step on the way to defence and foreign policy union and to political union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do need a voice for Europe on the world stage. We have reached a crossroads because we need to decide what role we want to play in the future. Do we want to become a key player in globalisation and have our voice heard, or do we want to be just a supplier for the more dynamic regions beyond Europe’s borders? Do we want to be crisis managers or do we want to become a museum? These are the decisions to be taken. This report points the way forward; it should guide our actions and we should start implementing it sooner rather than later and learn from the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken by this Parliament two years ago to establish a Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis has proved to be courageous and far-sighted, in the light of the results contained in the mid-term report and in the final report that will be adopted today.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was not easy to take that decision and, above all, to keep issues relating to the financial crisis together with those relating to the economic crisis and to their social consequences, which have proved to be extremely dangerous in most parts of the world and especially for us here in Europe. We have done some important work, therefore, and it is leading to an even more important conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">The scenarios presented in the report all suggest that, in order to end the crisis permanently, Europe’s institutional, political and economic structures need to be strengthened. Even this course of action was far from certain, but I believe it should be considered, especially at a time of great difficulty such as Europe is experiencing now.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposals contained in the report concern the creation of a Treasury Minister role; own resources for the EU budget; Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax; the coordination of taxation policies, the possibilities for which are indicated in the report; the idea that knowledge is crucial to the creation of quality jobs for young Europeans in the future; and the revival of cohesion policy, to strengthen the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are some innovative passages, but they propose strengthening the European Union, this Union that has lost its way slightly and is, in fact, being hit very hard by the crisis. Consequently, there are problems today that we must not underestimate or ignore, but we can overcome them by applying the proposals contained in the report correctly and consistently.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, the crisis is not over, we know that. However, today’s debate and vote concludes the work of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (the CRIS Committee). I would like to say a special thank you to Mrs Berès. You are a visionary in the true sense of the word. You are always equally stimulating to work with and a master of compromise. I would also like to thank my fellow Member behind me here, the rapporteur Mr Klinz, for his excellent work and for the way that he has chaired the committee.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As we have heard, we need more Europe, not less. Nationalism must not be allowed to gain a foothold once again in Europe. It was therefore good to hear what the Prime Minister, Mr Tusk, had to say. We must take a positive view of free trade, globalisation and movement across borders. We must achieve a clearer and stronger Europe. The report is visionary and forward-looking, and we know that the world today is changing at an enormous rate. Things that were taboo only a few years ago are now on everyone’s lips. You only need to look at the proposals relating to economic governance that the Commissioner mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I do have one important objection. The committee wants to increase the EU budget to between 2.5 and 10% of the Member States’ combined GNI. This is, if I may say so, completely unrealistic – visionary perhaps, but unrealistic. Referring to a report from 1977 does not improve matters. The Europe we have today is completely different. Citizens want a well-functioning Union that solves common, cross-border problems. The EU may well need more resources for common commitments in the future, but such a change must be made in dialogue and in agreement with the citizens. Therefore, we must not put the overall effect of the report at risk today. Visions are good and necessary, but they must be well-anchored. Today more than ever, the European project needs democratic legitimacy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the first report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis clearly identified the many causes of the financial crisis and their subsequent consequences for the EU and the global economy. I was confident that the second report would concentrate on what measures we would propose to ensure long-term growth and competitiveness in order to ensure the EU’s future prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am disappointed, therefore, that we cannot support the final result. The very idea that ‘more Europe’ – the central thesis of the final report – is the EU solution to a global economic crisis is one that my constituents in Wales are unable to relate to. It is not obvious how the EU speaking with one voice at the IMF or having one single European commissioner to deal with financial services legislation could somehow have prevented the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression or indeed how these measures will fuel the economic growth necessary for Europe to recover from the ongoing crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet, the most sinister part of the report – there seems to be a use of the crisis as an excuse to renegotiate membership of the EU – is the idea that the EU budget should be increased to 5%-10% of the EU’s GDP. To put this in perspective, at the moment, certain Member States, including my own, are quite rightly refusing to allow a 5% increase in the EU budget. Yet this report proposes up to a 900% increase. I think more than five Member States will be happy to sign a letter protesting against this suggestion of a 900% increase.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group fundamentally disagrees with many of the other issues raised in this report, like tax-raising powers for the EU and a common immigration policy. Therefore, I urge others to vote against this report today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, you have focused your comments in this debate on economic governance, that is to say, on the package of six directives that are currently being negotiated. The specific purpose of this report is to integrate this work but, also, to go beyond it. It also aims to indicate a path, a vision that goes beyond the very short-term discussions in which you are rightly involved. However, do take the time to read this report because it outlines a majority view. It is not just the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is a vision that results from a compromise, a compromise reached by a majority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Examining its contents provides a breath of fresh air with regard to the current situation. What is the issue at stake today? The issue is working out who will be paying for the crisis, who will be paying for these 20 percentage points of public debt, accumulated over three years, to save the markets, the banks, and Europe from a very significant recession. By continuing to focus on the issue of public finances, you are targeting the fire-fighter rather than the arsonist. If the Member States have spent 20 points of their Gross Domestic Product in additional debt, it was not for the pleasure of doing so, but because they had no other choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In solely considering the consequences and limiting yourselves to a European policy focusing on managing the consequences of this crisis, and not the causes, I think you are missing the point and you are causing pro-European opinion among Europeans to become significantly weaker. We know that today, we are threatened by this trend and this isolationism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second major issue which this report seeks to address concerns the balance of power between the Member States and the markets. We created the euro, in part, to prevent the markets from speculating on our currencies. That is what we saw in the 1990s. Currently, we are at the point at which we must prevent the markets from speculating on our public debts and, in order to do so, we have two tools available to us. The first is Eurobonds, which would involve mutualising our debt to ensure a deep liquid market, such that it is no longer possible to speculate against the single public debt market. The function of the second tool is to limit the capacity of the financial markets to speculate on public debt through a number of instruments. This is the path that a majority in Parliament is ready to propose to you. Seize this opportunity, President-in-Office, on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, unfortunately, in the Commission’s interim report a year ago, despite the rapporteur’s initial intentions, the real causes of the economic crisis and the debt crisis were not reported and analysed for reasons for which the majority of the Commission was to blame. Today’s final report, which is, unfortunately, based on these erroneous assumptions, basically proposes maintaining the same economic model, the same economic and social policies, that took us into the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">To be precise, the report remains within the framework shaped by the economic governance package, with a tighter Stability Pact; it remains within the framework of the Euro Pact, which is unravelling the European social model; and it remains with the framework of the model of privatisation of public property. This policy is already being applied in Greece, in Portugal and in Ireland and, as a result, the recession is getting worse, unemployment is rising, debt is increasing and speculators are making a profit and turning up the pressure.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report is basically a compromise between the two large groups and essentially considers the policy advocated by Mr Rehn, present here, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy as the only way forward. For us, this is not the only way forward. For us, there is the alternative proposal of a Europe of solidarity, of economic and social cohesion, and of democracy. It is the alternative proposal being put forward in the streets and squares, such as Constitution Square, which, unfortunately, the Greek Government bathed in German tear gas and blood last week, in the squares of Spain, in the squares of the Bastille and on the streets of London, where civil servants are demonstrating.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Angelides report by the US Congress Commission of inquiry has clearly demonstrated that the crisis was avoidable and has pointed the finger at public operators and the financial system, referring to those responsible by name: the Federal Reserve, rating agencies, investment banks and the five major US banks responsible have all been blamed for the ongoing crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even today, these practices are going on. The Commission of inquiry’s findings were preceded by the very serious, yet unheeded, warning that was also given by the crisis committee led by the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Maurice Allais. Unfortunately, the report does not say much about all this and, bowing to the superior knowledge of those economists – nearly all of them in fact – who were unable to predict the crisis, it overlooks today what is a key proposal for those who want to get to the root of the problem: to re-establish the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, aimed at separating the activities of traditional banks from those of investment and merchant banks – speculation, in other words – and to prohibit the creation and trading of financial derivatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report also disregards one of the key aspects of this powerful formula, which is necessary to ensure a financial recovery and to successfully combat corruption through the use of drastic measures. Lastly, how can one ignore the negative impact of the crisis on a serious problem such as immigration?</p>

However, the call for a 5% increase in our budget is extremely unfortunate. People will have great difficulty understanding this because it seems as if we are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
      <p sl="de">First, we need the reforms that should really have been brought forward in the Treaty of Maastricht, or the Treaty of Nice at the latest, but that have still not materialised. Only then can we discuss other forms of income and, in particular, increased income. I believe we would have shown real courage if we had said, ‘let us break up the big banks’.

I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Berès, and our Chair, Wolf Klinz, for doing excellent work, as well as all our colleagues who were involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main message from the committee is that we need steps towards economic and monetary union, including a European treasury, to tackle the global and European imbalances of sovereign debt and to create the prerequisites for growth. We need a common tax base. We need better own resources. We need to make more effective use of our own money by increasing the EU budget in the long term and by making strategically crucial investments. And we need stronger social cohesion in order to implement the EU 2020 goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need unified representation of the euro area and the EU as a whole in international forums. We need Europe to prioritise stronger, more efficient tackling of global economic governance, including better structures for financial regulation, with a stronger role for the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee’s work is at an end but the work of the EU towards achieving these goals is just beginning, and this is what we hope for our citizens.

      <p sl="de">These goals are indeed visionary. It will not be possible to achieve them all, but we do need to know the direction that we want to take. For that reason, Mr Vincent-Rostowski and Mr Rehn, I hope you will forgive me when I say that your answers were somewhat misguided because they refer to an economic governance package which certainly covers many important issues, and rightly so, but, as the report points out, it does not do enough. We need to go further. You are calling on us to agree to the economic governance package, yet you have failed to understand what this report tells us. What is more, this report is not alone in its findings. You can read articles by Helmut Schmidt, Nobel-prize-winner, Amartya Sen, and many others that say quite clearly: this is not enough. Your actions and those that we propose will not get us out of the crisis. Nothing has been said about growth. As the experiences of recent years have shown, it is a mistake to simply believe that growth will automatically occur. The report really says nothing about this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to say a few words about employment. The Polish Presidency has promised to tackle the employment issue and to present a plan on this matter. We have heard nothing about this today. We are still waiting. Hopefully, something is in the pipeline. Turning to the unjust distribution of income, it has been proven that the unjust distribution of income has led many people to take on loans, thereby getting into debt and contributing to the bubble that eventually caused the crisis. I do not wish to accuse you of not having read the report. However, with all this in mind, I would ask you to take the time to read the report. Let us have your honest position on it. It contains many good elements. We need greater focus on growth and employment and the just distribution of income, otherwise we will never emerge from this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was established in autumn 2009, many observers commented that it was too late. It should have been launched a year earlier and the crisis was almost over, they said. Today, we find ourselves not in the first or second year following the crisis, but rather in the fourth year of the crisis. The problem is still ongoing. Fukushima has shown that, one day, everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong. It was a similar story with the global financial crisis. Numerous negative factors coincided and, if it were not for the decisive action by the European Union and the USA, things might have hit a new low, leading to economic melt-down and a repeat of the great depression of the last century. Happily, this has been avoided. However, we now have the so-called debt crisis or the euro crisis in Europe. We have been in the grip of this problem for eighteen months now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I get the impression that Europe’s decision makers have not been providing active leadership for the last year-and-a-half. They react to market distortions and turbulences in the market, but they do not act with foresight on the basis of a clear vision of where they want to take Europe. That is what is missing. There is a lack of vision, and our citizens have the impression that it is business as usual for those who caused the crisis: profits are privatised, losses are socialised and the actual issues are side-stepped. That is where our report has its starting point. It makes proposals for the overall direction of the future development of the European Union and the euro area. Mrs Berès explained these proposals in detail and Mr Karas also discussed them. I do not need to go into further detail at this point.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one important point to note, however, which is that Europe has reached an extremely critical turning point. If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo of the integration already achieved, and will instead find ourselves taking a step backwards. It is important that all of us who believe in Europe and who want to shape Europe’s future should support these ideas, addressing our citizens and the representatives of the national parliaments and trying to win them over to our cause.</p>

The compromise reached by the report can be briefly summed up as follows: the cure for us all is more Europe. Is this really a cure, however? If we think that a larger European Union budget and smaller national budgets, a unified immigration policy or European taxes will be this ‘medicine’, then we are mistaken. Take the example of the three euro area countries that had to be bailed out, where the whole burden of these three countries is placed on the shoulders of these countries’ citizens and governments, while leaving the interests of European Union lender nations’ commercial banks, pension funds and insurance companies completely untouched, even though they, too, ought to bear a proportion of the losses from these investments. How will it all end in these three countries? It will end as it did in Latvia, because at the time when Latvia had the largest fall in gross domestic product (GDP), the nation that lent the most for investment in Latvia recorded the largest GDP growth in the European Union.

      <p sl="fr">Your solution, therefore, is ‘more Europe’, for Europe to become a real state and to do away with national sovereignties. That must involve tight control of Member States’ budgets, with the European Semester, the suppression of any deviation from the ‘economic governance’ package and the creation of a European finance minister to levy taxes and issue Eurobonds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report, contrary to the views of a number of my fellow Members, is not unrealistic. It is not by saying that we need more resources in Europe that we become unrealistic. We would be unrealistic if we said that from now on, we have the means to achieve all our ambitions and that there is no erosion of national sovereignty. The erosion of national sovereignty does exist and it is used to make up for the shortcomings of national sovereignty; it is Europe that needs resources. If this report is sure it can provide Europe with the means it requires, it is only being even more realistic. Moreover, we must have the courage to tell the truth: the problem is not the citizens of Europe not wanting more Europe; the problem is all the politicians, who continue to make Europeans believe that everything could be done without Europe, and that a nation state will be able to solve all the problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I ask you: where does the nation state stand when it comes to the pressure being exerted today by the rating agencies? Is the nation state capable of reversing this juggernaut of a multifaceted crisis, which is undermining the recovery efforts being made by millions of Europeans? It is Europe that will know how to solve these problems, not the nation state. The nation state is no longer able to do so in 2011, nor will it be able to in 2014. We will need more Europe, and this report shows us the way forward and tells us how to get there.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to take some bold decisions in this Europe if we want to do more than just survive. The crisis has severely disrupted normal life for European citizens and businesses and, if we do not react, it could mean that the quality of the social and cultural life, the welfare and the future of young people and Europeans, are irreversibly affected.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as creating valuable cohesion and prosperity, overcoming the crisis means finding solutions to the causes identified: solutions for tackling speculation, which should also be restricted where necessary through the introduction of strict rules for the financial markets; solutions for combating the recession; solutions for combating the imbalanced development model that has put individuals below profit; and solutions for combating the resurgence of nationalism, which is today preventing Europe from making the choices that it has to make.</p>
      <p sl="it">Above all, it is time to provide tools and resources – new and old – so that we can forge ahead and start the engine of growth, with research, innovation, training and support for productive investment, infrastructure and jobs, because without jobs, people have no dignity or rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thanks to Mrs Berès and other Members, this report outlines a possible strategy for a Europe that is proud and aware of its role. It is now up to Europe’s leaders, if they exist, to implement it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Berès for the sizeable task she has carried out with Mr Klinz and all their colleagues on this committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe we need a long-term vision, and as Mr Engel has just reminded us so well, the supporters of the nation state – some of whom, moreover, have no objection to being paid by the European Parliament to spit on Europe – have nothing to contribute. I would remind them that even the Roman Empire fell. However, in more tangible terms, we need this vision and we need laws immediately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to respond to two points, since economic governance has been mentioned here by several speakers. Mrs Berès, the negotiations are not deadlocked, they are taking their course. We have a democratically elected parliament which is trying to play its role in ordinary legislative procedure, before the Council for the first time, and with the help of the Commission. Therefore, we are counting on the Polish Presidency, as we know we can count on the Commission – and I want to pay homage to all the work done by Commissioner Rehn and his teams to find solutions. We are in debate, not deadlock. There should be no question of hasty decisions on subjects such as these.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I think that, from time to time, we should be aware of what we are achieving. I shall give you two examples: matters are moving forward with Eurobonds just as with the financial transaction tax, which Mrs Berès referred to. I would emphasise that the Commission has shown a great deal of courage on these two issues: Commissioner Rehn is ready to commit if we reach agreement on governance for Eurobonds and Commissioner Lewandowski and the College have made the link between own resources and the financial transaction tax. We are working. Let us not worry too much about the Eurosceptics who have nothing to contribute.</p>

      <p sl="pt">What is actually happening is that these countries are being seriously encroached upon and reduced to submission, and their peoples are being subjected to policies of austerity, and are witnessing the robbery of their workers, pensioners and ordinary citizens. This is being done solely for the benefit of the international financial sector and of big companies, which intend to take control of strategic companies at low cost through their privatisation. These packages, founded on neoliberal policies, on reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact and the Euro Plus Pact, on so-called economic governance and on the Europe 2020 strategy, alongside liberalisations and attacks on social and labour rights, are causing recession, increased unemployment, increased social inequality and greater poverty in these countries, which means a break from and a change to these policies is urgently required. We would therefore express our solidarity with the peoples and workers of these countries who are fighting against these policies.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost two years after the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis was set up, I am presenting my final report which, in my view, is one of the most important documents with a long-term vision which the European Parliament has produced, thanks to the hard work, great patience and cooperation between the political groups. I feel that the following points are important in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Firstly, resolving the issue of the high levels of public debt which we have nowadays in some Member States. Each one of us is well aware that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Sooner or later, someone has to pay the bill. This is why not only some but all Member States must take responsibility and reduce their countries’ expenditure so that acceptable deficit levels can be achieved. This is obviously not the actual solution resulting in economic growth. However, it is an important prerequisite for providing business and European citizens with financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The second issue is competitiveness. We need to focus our efforts aimed at increasing the European economy’s competitiveness on completing the Single Market, tapping the potential for growth and creating jobs. I believe that one of the ways for us to achieve this is by preserving tax competition in the Union because it will enable us to ensure the ideal business environment, which will also result in further investment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Last but not least, new Member States which do not belong to the euro area must be involved on an equal footing with the other countries in making decisions about the Union’s future. I believe, as most of my fellow Members do, that the solution for exiting the crisis is more Europe and integration. I wish to thank all my colleagues for their work over these last two years. I am pleased that I was a member of this committee.</p>

      <p sl="el">Her report contains an in-depth analysis of the causes of the crisis and proposes specific, ambitious and solid proposals to get us out of the crisis. If this approach, these proposals, are adopted by the Council, we can be certain that, not only shall we manage the crisis efficiently, but we shall also protect the Union and the euro area from future crises, we shall strengthen it institutionally and politically and, most importantly, we shall be in a position to restore its credibility in the eyes of European citizens and to regain their trust in our common European future.</p>
      <p sl="el">With its specific proposals, such as specific measures to strengthen employment, a system of Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, this report sends a strong message that we need more and a stronger Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, finally, after two years, we have received the report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Berès, and the Chair of the committee, Mr Klinz, for their work. However, I must point out that it is thanks not least to the dedication of Mr Karas, the coordinator from our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of Mr Engel and of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Pietikäinen, that we have been able to present such a good document.</p>
      <p sl="de">The crisis committee was originally intended to analyse the causes of the crisis and to offer long-term recommendations. We have now formulated five recommendations under five main headings. In addition, the report also analyses the necessary steps in the areas of competitiveness, energy policy, the EU’s internal market, migration and research, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, taxation, employment and training. I believe that what we now do with these excellent recommendations is of crucial importance. It is not enough to formulate the necessary steps – we now also need to take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU institutions need to play a stronger role in formulating and implementing joint measures. In my view, the EU is at a crossroads. Either we decide to take the next step towards integration or we allow the EU to drift apart because of the current differences over economic policy. After all, just because the crisis committee has finished its work, this does not mean that the crisis is over. The debt crisis poses an enormous challenge for all of us. We need to face up to this challenge. This is something that we are certainly going to do in the coming months in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, a notable professor of economics once said that the longer young people study the subject, the more arrogant they become. In other words, this is a question of where these arrogant bankers, greedy investors, biased credit rating agencies, etc., come from. They come from universities, colleges, from among us here, and that is why we need rules and regulations to curb this greed. Moreover, we need them now in Greece, and we need them in Europe, and even the United States of America needs new ground rules. I think that this report is excellent, as is the Commission’s commitment to establishing new ground rules in both the long and the short term.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I wish to point out, however, that Europe is being hampered by a lack of consensus, because now we have to take decisions to reassure the public and the markets that everything is under control. I also wish to point out that, not only is there this lack of consensus, but also in some way, a virtue deficit. As Mrs Berès said, it is quite strange that nothing has been learned. For example, the bonuses of bank executives, which led to the wrong decisions being made, are only increasing at present; in other words, nothing has been learned.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I think that this is a very important report, and it provides global solutions, such as Eurobonds, the new Economic Security Council and current solutions. Congratulations to Mrs Berès and to our Chair, Mr Klinz.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating the rapporteur and everyone who contributed to the success of this report. There is no doubt that this report constitutes, and will constitute, a benchmark for robust and coordinated recommendations and responses to the challenges of the crisis. If we can draw one conclusion, it is that the crisis we are experiencing will only be overcome by deepening European integration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At a time of severe financial, economic and social difficulties, and of painful austerity measures in some Member States, such as my country, Portugal, the temptation is to shelter behind a protectionist and nationalist attitude. However, this is a mistake. The European response to the crisis involves genuine European economic governance that pursues sustainable growth, promotes job creation and develops the social market economy, providing long-term responses with established objectives with which the Member States agree.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The strategy for escaping the crisis needs to be financed with a Union budget that is sufficiently ambitious. In order to prevent another sovereign debt and euro crisis, there is a need for closer coordination on budgetary policy, as well as for the creation of a system for issuing public debt securities and Eurobonds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I will conclude by stressing that there is also a need to maintain levels of social protection in these difficult times, above all, for the most vulnerable Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we are discussing one of the most important reports of the recent period. The European Parliament is the first institution to formulate a detailed opinion on the causes of the crisis, the ways out of it, how we can avoid another crisis, and also what ‘more Europe’ means, which we have mentioned several times recently. Decisions on strengthening the euro area are made slowly and with difficulty, and it is good that Parliament has laid down its ideas in this regard. We must not allow internal imbalances to undermine the European project. We must insist on our principles that emphasise cooperation and solidarity, both inside and outside of the euro area. The Berès report attributes importance to preserving the welfare acquis and the social support system, which also act as economic stabilisers. We can achieve the objectives laid down in the 2020 strategy only by increasing the appropriate financial resources; that is why it is important that the report calls for a long-term and considerable increase of EU budget resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to join the line of those welcoming this report, especially its practical recommendations. With this report, our Parliament shows vision and provides concrete policy tools to address challenges to come. It provides a focus for the EU 2020 strategy by addressing the new job creation objectives. This is just one of the many important contributions of the EPP Group to this report. It calls for a new generation of EU funding programmes to support innovative and job-creating SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Education and youth are core elements of the EU 2020 strategy. They will remain a foundation of our efforts to promote innovation, growth and sustainability. Without the implementation of the educational policy tools, the EU 2020 strategy will fail. This report paves the way for a new EU internship programme involving both the private sector and SMEs, and proposes the introduction of a European innovation scholarship, which should contribute to the fostering of the knowledge and skills of those employed in innovative sectors.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the current crisis is the most serious since the EU has existed and the first since the creation of the euro.</p>
      <p sl="es">Its complexity and depth oblige us to redefine the foundations of an economy and a globalisation lacking control or responsibility. Moreover, it places stress on the European social model and adds to the challenges of competitiveness, ageing and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">It will not resolve itself spontaneously or at a national level. It calls for a political response, and for a determined and sustained course of action to be pursued on a European and international scale.</p>
      <p sl="es">The creation of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis demonstrates the commitment of Parliament to overcome a crisis that is still not over with a democratic response.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Berès report addresses the problems of sovereign debt, global imbalances and the construction of a global governance system, the steps towards a new international monetary system, the actions necessary in order to fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and criteria for rethinking the future of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">The common thread is ‘strength in unity’. The EU must not disappear when it is most needed, or resign itself to irrelevance. Citizens must know that the EU will add value to their future and the Member States must know that it will support their reform processes.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this, the EU needs to rely not on rhetoric but on a gem: a powerful budget based on own resources, combating tax evasion and the issue of Eurobonds. This is why I support the report, so that the EU counts in the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the objective that we set ourselves has not been fully achieved, in my view.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report has not fully met the Commission’s objective of analysing the causes of the crisis and proposing tools for use in reviving the economy. The implications and the development of this crisis, which started off as a financial crisis before becoming an economic crisis and now, tragically, also a social crisis, has forced us and is still forcing us to be extremely cautious in our proposals. Our task is to support measures that will prevent further economic crises and successfully boost growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report we are examining contains some measures that could fulfil these tasks, but only if they are implemented quickly and with the necessary resources. I am referring to the Tobin tax, to bonds for infrastructure, to actions in support of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to extend the European transport networks and to complete the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European system is still too slow to act; very often, policies are adopted after a long delay. We need more Europe; we need a Europe that is more in touch with real needs. A Europe that is timid, divided and pervaded by harmful nationalism makes us too weak in this globalised era and continues to favour speculators, who, in recent years, have come to view our continent as fertile ground for their interests. I am grateful to the rapporteur and to Mr Karas.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Kotecki, Commissioner, it is often said that crises help strengthen Europe. That has been the case historically, but I am not so sure that it remains true today. The slow, improvised and reactive way in which the Union is responding to the Greek crisis is exacerbating the situation every day, and is causing a lack of confidence in the Union and its currency to spread in a most appalling way. This is despite the problems in the euro area resulting from obvious failings in the construction of the single currency, which are currently focused on its weakest links.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order for the result of the current crisis to be a strengthened Union, there is a need for a strategic vision, as there was in the past, and which, unfortunately, neither the Commission nor the Council has been able to implement in connection with the European programme or project.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this report by Parliament gives us this vision: the solution is more Europe and not less. Parliament recalls that the market and the single currency are creating unsustainable divergences between economies, which must be counteracted by specific policies. It acknowledges that, in order for the euro to work, it requires a European budget strengthened by own resources, and requires a solidarity-based European agency for issuing debt, capable of protecting the Member States from market speculation, and of providing them with credit at reasonable prices and with reasonable deadlines. It also acknowledges that the transferability of degrees and workers between countries requires mutual recognition of social rights and pensions. Parliament has united to send clear messages: let us hope that the Commission and the Council listen.</p>

This report from the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis is a little like my first friend, blaming our misfortunes on all sorts of factors – rating agencies, an insufficient federal budget, etc. However, in reality, our problems are fairly simple and there are only two — the lack of competition at the European level, and excessively large budget deficits.

In today’s climate of global competition, it is no longer possible for every Member State to go it alone. I believe that competition is an important and necessary instrument. However, I also believe it is important for our 27 Member States to have joint strategies for the globalised financial markets and in relation to our major competitors on the other continents.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not in favour of more Europe across the board, but I do advocate more Europe in areas where the 27 can only succeed by pooling their efforts. In this context, we have discussed key points in relation to the financial markets, pointing out, in particular, that we cannot achieve greater economic growth simply through financial trading, but rather that the answer lies in coordinated and sustainable economic activity.

      <p sl="da">I am extremely pleased that there is a chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises, which are very important for growth in Europe. That, of course, is not something that we would disagree on. Unfortunately, there are very few citizens in the Member States who want the ultra-federalist initiative that is, regrettably, also envisaged in the report. When I say this, I am, of course, thinking of paragraph 99 and amendments referring to the need for an EU budget corresponding to 5-10% of the Union’s GDP. This is an incredibly bad and irresponsible proposal that seriously overshadows the good proposals – it is out of step with what the majority of citizens in the Member States want.</p>

While our first report drew up solutions to current problems – bank levies, the certification of hedge funds, a financial transaction tax – we are now setting out our vision for 2013 and beyond. We need rules for effective crisis management, greater integration between the Member States and sustainability in employment and growth policies. Budgetary discipline must become our new watchword, from the regions right up to European level. The Stability and Growth Pact, which has been undermined for years, now needs to be replaced with a robust monitoring system from which no member of the euro area can be exempt.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need decisions. Do we need a European finance ministry, as proposed by Mr Trichet, President of the European Central Bank (ECB)? Are Eurobonds to be introduced, in combination with stricter adherence to regulations? Is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to develop into a European debt agency? How can we break the dominance of the credit rating agencies, which have been proven completely wrong so often in the past?

      <p sl="sk">An important role is also played in this context by cohesion policy, which must move closer to EU citizens, in my opinion, since up to two-thirds of public investments in Europe currently remain below the national level.</p>

This is because your formula of austerity and punitive interest rates only feeds speculators and will never, on its own, enable Greece and the other Member States to start growing and creating wealth again, even in order to pay their debts.</p>

The Berès report points the way to the ‘New Deal’ that will save Europe: Eurobonds, more economic governance, more own resources for the European Union and, above all, good political governance, in order to regulate the financial sector, and to punish and control tax havens.

      <p sl="en">I fully agree with those such as Ms Jaakonsaari who say that we need to express unity in our policy making at this critical juncture. We need unity to overcome the current crisis and we need creativity and courage in pursuing a substantive debate on Europe in the day after tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues is Eurobonds, and that is very much linked to the overall reform of economic governance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I suggest we come back to the issue later, because it is impossible to hear or even talk. I cannot hear my own voice. We will return to the subject later.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to say a few words about Eurobonds and the governance reform in relation to the growth policies referred to in Ms Berès’ report. I want to underline one important point about Eurobonds, namely, that this House will get a very meaty and substantial response from the Commission about the way forward on Eurobonds, at the latest six months after the Council and Parliament reach agreement on the economic package.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already promised – and I can assure you again – that, as soon as we have agreement on the package, the brightest and best minds of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Economic and Monetary Affairs will be put to work on a very substantive report for this House, which you will have on your desks within six months. This sequence is simply a matter of common sense. If we do not have stronger economic governance and greater discipline in the euro area in particular, what real hope is there that Eurobonds will take off and will deliver the benefits your report anticipates?</p>
      <p sl="en">Without prior serious reform of economic governance, and real discipline and economic coordination, Eurobonds would quickly turn to junk bonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next, on the reform package, I am sorry some of you do not share the Commission’s view that the package should be one of our key priorities at this critical juncture. However, I am encouraged by those of you who do share that view. I make no apology for returning to this issue from a different angle.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any programme of reform needs to be prioritised and sequenced. If you are addressing a problem, you need, as the first priority, to tackle its root cause. Therefore, we have to ask whether we are in the mess we are in because we did not have a different arrangement for external representation of the euro area. The answer is ‘no’. Are we in this mess because Germany and Italy issued their own debt instruments? No. Are we in this mess because of inadequate investment in tertiary education? No. These are all important issues, but let us recall that we are in this mess mainly because of fiscal indiscipline, even in good times, and because we failed to identify and act on important macro-economic imbalances. We are where we are because we did not have sufficient commitment from the Member States to meeting their European obligations, and because the economic leg of economic and monetary union has always been too weak.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">If we cannot see this, and if we cannot act decisively to remedy it, then all of the rest is just rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. The legislative package is all about putting the ‘economic’ back in economic and monetary union. Assuming that we get through this current crisis, which is not a foregone conclusion, it is all about preventing the next crisis. It is really fundamental. It is about the Community method; it is about economic stability, the foundations of sustainable growth and improving employment; and it is about European coordination and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In short, it is about keeping the European project alive and kicking.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, this is the beginning of the Polish Presidency, which is to run for six months – and from this point of view, six months may seem a fairly short period – but we can all see how fast things are changing and how fast things are happening at the moment, particularly in the field of economics and finance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why we have these serious challenges before us, and I would like to stress that the main items on the agenda of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission are the same. The priorities are the same – they are shared. Naturally, each side should make its own point of view clear on particular issues – and I am sure this will be done – but I am certain that it is by working together that the European Union will cope with the difficult situation we are currently experiencing. As the Polish Presidency and as an impartial participant, we are determined to help and to facilitate a mutual understanding of each other’s position and thereby achieve agreement. In this context, something which particularly comes to the fore is the question of what is being called the ‘six-pack’, which is, in particular, the part of the EU’s work intended to prevent a repeat of a situation such as the one we have now.</p>

      <p sl="nl">With this report, Parliament is sticking its neck out with daring and innovative policy choices. In these days of economic turbulence, Euro-pessimism and Euro-realistic ‘no’ votes, politics has to dare to swim against the tide. The policy options that currently enjoy the support of a large majority of Members of this House are no pipe dream. They are the result of a year of intensive consultation and negotiations. A clear majority has been obtained in this House for establishing a European Energy Community. For me, that is one of the most important points. Europe must itself utilise a single European energy policy. Specifically, it must draw up a common strategy for renewable sources of energy and cross-border infrastructure. This must represent core business for the EU, as it is the only way to attain our climate targets and to turn around our vulnerable position as a major importer of energy into that of maximum self-sufficiency. Furthermore, it is also massively important that a European Ministry of Finance be developed. This idea is on the table, and it enjoys broad support in Parliament. Then there is the issuing of Eurobonds. To sum up, these are tangible measures that will enable Europe to emerge from the current financial crisis stronger and that are very much of the kind that will guarantee the prosperity of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">A third Member State has felt obliged recently to request aid from the European Union as it was unable to obtain financing. Against the current background of the public debt crisis and a fragile European economy, we need greater political and economic integration. In this respect, I welcome the report drafted on the financial, economic and social crisis, which highlights the importance of relaunching the European project.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To emerge from the stalemate it is in, the European Union must make long-term investments in key areas such as education, research and the road and IT infrastructures. These measures would help boost competitiveness and counteract job losses. We need a standard taxation policy at EU level to encourage these investments. In addition, the creation of bonds to be issued jointly for part of Europe’s public debt would automatically reduce the cost of financing in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I would like to begin by expressing my enormous gratitude for what is an absolutely key report. It may mark an historical breakthrough if there is sufficient political will to carry through the recommendations. On the other hand, I do wonder if this impulse to deepen the European project really had to wait for a global crisis. Any measure can be better implemented in more peaceful times. It is often the case, however, that crises create opportunities – and I hope that will be the case here as well. The most urgent issue in today’s situation is to maintain the common currency. In this context, we cannot avoid fundamental reform of the EU budget. It was clear more than three decades ago that currency union requires a larger budget than the EU has at present. The budget needs its own sources, and we must take into account the serious long-term implementation of budgetary policies at EU level. The report, of course, contains a whole series of other key steps which, in the long term, should prevent the occurrence of crises such as the present one. The measures to limit capital flows and the emphasis on support for the real economy are important. In my opinion, the stronger role of the UN is a positive move – the EU can be a valid part of a multilateral world. A common Ministry of Finance, Eurobonds, a European Debt Agency – these are all important proposals. Now more than ever, we need political union and economic integration. We need more Europe.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report by Mrs Berès sends out a strong signal for a permanent solution to the current crisis, setting out a whole series of ambitious recommendations. I can agree with the statement by the rapporteur that the crisis caused by large sovereign debts in various Member States has revealed the risks of imbalances within Europe. The EU must act and respond in a unified way by pressing harder for the closer coordination and harmonisation of fiscal policy. I agree with this view, and I also agree with the rapporteur’s idea that closer European integration can act as a protective shield against a future crisis. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that the asymmetrical development of individual euro area member countries must not be allowed to grow more pronounced in the future. The rapporteur makes a very daring call, however, for the creation of a single European Ministry of Finance, the powers of which would include joint administration of debt. This European super-ministry would be able to contribute towards better coordination of economic policy in the euro area and elsewhere. Such a development would mark a revolutionary change, but at this point in time, it is not at all clear whether the Union or the euro area is capable of such a fundamental intellectual and organisational change. At the same time, however, it is already clear that the euro area cannot continue to operate in its existing form after the current crisis, and will require profound reform.</p>

      <p sl="de">Many of our citizens are disappointed and exasperated by EU policy. It is with some justification that they feel that they are the only ones who are required to suffer the consequences of the crisis. The high-finance sector, which has been rescued using taxpayers’ money, is once again making huge profits. Even though it was largely responsible for the crisis, it is not being required to pick up the costs. In order to prevent future crises, those who profit from speculation must be required to pay a solidarity contribution. The EU should play a pioneering role in the introduction of a transaction tax, even though no agreement was reached at the last G20 summit in Toronto. However, fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States. Brussels should not be allowed to exploit this situation in order to acquire taxation powers, paving the way for a centralised federal state. What we need is a coordinated approach to the issue of a financial transaction tax between the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">The crisis has kept the political boundaries intact but not the economic ones. It has also shown us that risk knows no boundaries. Hence, we need a broad and comprehensive approach rather than an ad hoc, case-by-case one. The only solution to be proposed with conviction, therefore, is that of a system of global governance that lays down common rules for all. We can build competitiveness, open up our markets and make them more efficient, but that will not protect us from future crises. No State or financial institution can consider itself safe, even if it is built on solid foundations, because of our interconnected economies. We have increasingly open and common markets, but we also have rules that differ from one State to the next, preventing the control and the supervision that the markets and the citizens are calling for. Common, blanket rules will not hinder the markets. Rather, they will give operators and investors more security and peace of mind. Europe must once again attract investment and manufacturing, and gain recognition as an international model of innovation and growth. Public and private financial institutions must do their best to ensure that the markets work to benefit the real economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. Unity and solidarity are essential if Europe is to successfully overcome the global challenge.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mrs Berès’s report is balanced and comprehensive and proposes real solutions and mechanisms to combat the financial, economic and social crisis. The fiscal problems which the Member States currently face and the need for important investments and growth call for new financing models, with a combination of public and private funds. I welcome the proposal made in the report to use project bonds in cooperation with the European Investment Bank and the recommendation that Eurobonds should be further investigated, so as to ensure that they benefit all the Member States. I consider that, beyond the common currency, the countries in the euro area should take another step, by making appropriate arrangements to jointly issue bonds and manage part of the Member States’ public debt, so as to lay the foundations for more coordinated multilateral supervision which will make the market in the euro area as a whole more attractive.</p>

Article 3 of the existing budgetary agreement makes it necessary to adjust the budgetary framework and political agreements accordingly when dealing with amendments to the Treaty with consequences for the budget.

Unfortunately, despite all their efforts, the Presidencies did not receive a sufficient mandate from the Council.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, after two years of arguments back and forth, we have finally reached an agreement on new rules for food information for consumers. The Danish Liberal Party would have liked to have seen some more ambitious rules. We will make no secret of that. It is not because we politicians should dictate what people eat, but in people’s stressful everyday lives, it can actually be difficult to determine what individual foods contain. We must therefore make it easy to see which foods are healthy and which are unhealthy. The focus is still on the mandatory 100 g nutrition labelling. The Danish Liberal Party would also have liked to have seen a common system for indicating the proportion of a person’s daily calorie intake that a particular food item represents. We did not entirely achieve this aim. There will be more realistic and accurate rules for guideline daily amounts (GDAs), so this nevertheless represents a step in the right direction. Therefore, we have today voted in favour of the compromise with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="it">My amendment, which is taken up in the institutional compromise, was undoubtedly more ambitious and required more extensive marking of the origin and provenance of other products too – not just of meat, but of milk, dairy products in general and meat used as an ingredient in food. Nevertheless, it is satisfying to know that a road map has been established that will see the Commission present a specific report on this issue in two and three years’ time. The report will therefore include proposals to ensure the increased – not to say full – protection of all Europeans in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="it">I wish to take advantage of this speech to say that, overall, I consider this to be a positive report, and I therefore voted in favour of it. However, I do believe that the Commission should endeavour to reassess certain shortcomings, such as the failure to include rabbit meat, which is acknowledged to be one of the best types of white meat for a person’s diet and nutrition and which could be included in the assessment that the Commission has pledged to carry out within the next three years, with a compatibility assessment that I hope it can develop as soon as possible.</p>

Spending available funds wisely involves buying foods that have been grown, reared or fished in a sustainable manner, and in accordance with known standards, and being aware that spending a bit more on foods that contain less saturated fat, are low in salt, or contain moderate levels of sugar, contributes to our health.</p>
      <p sl="es">Accordingly, in order to tie up any loose ends relating to this regulation, we need to investigate in-depth the training that consumers need in order to make the most of all the information that is going to be available to them.</p>

I am pleased that the line that I pursued from the beginning was adopted. We are to have correct, clear and easy-to-understand information on the packaging, but no more mandatory information. We will increase the opportunity for consumers to make informed choices with regard to which wholesome foods they want on their plates, and we will not lecture or dictate what people should eat. I am particularly pleased that origin labelling for all meat, as I proposed from the start, was included. The Commission is to ensure that this is implemented in a reasonable way. Allergens are to be highlighted in the list of ingredients. We are to have rules concerning legibility, with minimum requirements concerning a clear typeface and contrast. The rules relating to imitations are also extremely good, and we are to make vigorous efforts to prohibit all misleading information. It is regrettable, however, that trans fats will not be clearly labelled. I believe that this balanced and sound compromise will give consumers greater freedom of choice without creating additional unnecessary bureaucracy for small businesses.</p>

European consumers must know what they are eating and where the raw materials actually come from. Information on the product label must be informative and clear. Pretty labels such as ’Made in the EU’ or ’Made in Estonia’ can be a myth, actually deceiving consumers even more.

From now on, no food can ever be labelled as harmful unless it really is, meaning that consumers will not be forced to exclude it completely from their diet.

It is also necessary, however, so that road users do not have a sense of impunity in another country. When driving, for example, on the road from Brussels to Strasbourg, we can see a lot of drivers and cars registered in far-away countries boldly exceeding the speed limit in the knowledge that they will not be punished.

Under Article 9, the Commission should draw up at Union level guidelines for road traffic safety within the framework of the common transport policy.

      <p sl="it">I also welcome the fact that, as well as the traditional offence of speeding, other offences will include non-use of seat belts, failure to stop at a red traffic light, drink-driving and driving under the influence of drugs, to mention the most common ones.

It has happened not as the result of a decision of this House or of any of the national legislatures. It has been driven, rather, by creative interpretation on the Commission’s part and judicial activism by the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Treaties provide for free movement and settlement where the person moving is able to support himself, either from a pension or by working in the host country, but a series of recent cases has undermined the basis of that agreement. We have had the case of a Portuguese national who worked in Germany and is claiming German benefits on his return to Portugal, and we have Dutch nationals who are denied Dutch benefits when they move abroad, whereas foreign nationals continue to claim them if they have been in Holland. We have a similar case in Britain: a pensioner from one of the Baltic States who is claiming supplementary benefits because her Baltic pension is not enough to support her.</p>

      <p sl="en">Also, from the point of view of the danger to public health, it deals with the issue of ionising radiation. The radiation exposure represents merely 2% of that of radiation treatment or an x-ray.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is a good report, but the important thing is that it is not left lying on a Commission desk gathering dust. We should implement this.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, scanners are an excellent idea. I myself went through a scanner like this once in the United States, and I found that it was a very agreeable experience. It was a lot quicker, and it is definitely a bit different when you can walk into a scanner and you do not need, as you do now, to strip half-naked and take off your shoes, jacket, belt and everything. I am therefore in favour of scanners.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, we have to ensure that they do not have any impact on health, and there always needs to be another option if someone does not want to go through the scanner. Many of the fears that relate to how the data might be misused, however, are surely grossly exaggerated, and I hope that scanners will be introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another issue, obviously, is taking liquids on board an aircraft. On this point we have got behind the times, and ordinary people’s lives are being made very difficult indeed, and I would hope that this ban can also be lifted as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="et">Madam President, given the terrorist threat and previous tragic experience of terrorism in the world, it is vitally important to increase the level of air safety, and, of course, to do so using security scanners. Scanners are a powerful weapon in the fight against terrorism. This topic is described very well in the report, although unfortunately, the issue of cost remains unresolved. It is unfortunate that we increase protection for air passengers and develop air security only when some terrorist attack has happened; in other words, after air security has been tested. We need a proper risk assessment which could anticipate various risk factors early on and deal pre-emptively with the corresponding threats. This means that we also need a strategy. Although I support security, I am against methods which would pose a threat to human health or privacy, or which would humiliate people.</p>

The issue has always been one of great difficulty for authorities. But what concerns me about the use of these scanners is where there is no alternative. Fortunately, an alternative is called for in this report, but there are still a number of countries around the world where you are refused the right to travel if you refuse to use a scanner.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are genuine concerns. There are still people who are medically trained who are frequent travellers and who complain about the health hazards of travelling. But, in particular, I would like to point out one problem which some of my constituents have written to me about: the problem that arises for people who carry colostomy bags or ileostomy bags. If people who carry those refuse to be scanned, they are either refused travel or, what happens in the end, is that they are subjected to the most amazing humiliation in front of fellow travellers. It is about time staff were trained better and made to be more sensitive to members of the travelling public who suffer from these problems.</p>

I am especially pleased that four-fifths of those in attendance supported the adoption of this report. I should say that, in the seven years that I have been in the European Parliament, this is still the first report on this topic that has gained this level of support. Gender equality is a basic right in the European Union. I would now ask whether, in the time that the European Union has existed, we are satisfied with our achievements in this area. I am not. Do women in Europe have equal opportunities with men? Without immersing ourselves in facts, we can see that they do not.

      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, at the moment, barely 4% of the board members in Italy are women. Other countries have already passed similar legislation and I hope many others will do so in the coming months. Capable and qualified women must be allowed to achieve professional growth in line with their male colleagues, demonstrating and exercising their capabilities. You know, holding a position due exclusively to merit and professionalism is surely more gratifying and less humiliating, but I am convinced that we have to carry out a true ‘pink revolution’ which has an ever growing female presence as its ultimate objective, without necessarily having to resort to quotas.</p>
      <p sl="it">In future, due to our daily commitment, equal opportunity will not have to be recognised solely by law, but must represent an indefeasible value held by society, based not only on gender equality, but also on a genuine and inherent cultural equality.</p>

We should not legislate on quotas and we should not ask the Commission to take measures to force wage differences to be dealt with or certain quotas of women to be taken on in companies. The European Parliament and the Commission have an important role to play in stimulating debate, shaping opinion and putting pressure on companies, but not in dictating from above.

In the majority of new Member States, agricultural producers are counting on the current system of the common agricultural policy, while from the cohesion policy they expect the realisation of basic infrastructure investments, as in this area we fall well behind the old Member States.

In this context, it seems essential to have a measure ensuring that the list of travel documents is constantly updated, while at the same time ensuring that Member States have the fullest possible information available. In the interests of simplicity and effectiveness, Member States would be asked to give an opinion on the recognition or non-recognition of these documents.

Mr Voss’s report, which I endorsed by voting in favour, highlights the changes to be made so that every European citizen can be guaranteed, even where this involves relations with citizens of third countries, the requirement of privacy to be safeguarded as a guarantee of our freedom.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also agree with what is set out in the document, namely, that rules should be issued with a high level of protection of sensitive data which strike a fair balance between the right to privacy and the right to information and to expression, and lastly, rules that do not unnecessarily hinder everyday processing of these data. This means that, in general terms, sensitive data must remain secret, except where it is the data subject himself who is interested in derogating, by express consent, from this rule.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The world around us has been completely transformed by the rapid development of technology and globalisation, and new challenges have appeared in the area of personal data protection. Technology today enables individuals to share information about what they do and about their likes and dislikes, and enables them to publish this and make it globally accessible on a scale never seen before. Social networking websites are the most prominent example, with hundreds of millions of members all around the world. A recent study confirmed that data protection bodies, business federations and organisations representing consumers all agree that online activities entail increased risks from the perspective of protecting privacy and personal data. At the same time, the methods for collecting personal data are more sophisticated and perhaps more difficult to detect. It is therefore right to ask whether existing EU legislation in the area of data protection is still capable of responding fully and effectively to potential threats. Despite the existence of the EU’s common legal framework on data protection, the insufficient harmonisation of Member State legislation is one of the main continuing fears of the parties concerned. I firmly believe that the EU should draw up a complex and coherent approach, ensuring full compliance with the basic right of individuals to the protection of data, both inside and outside the EU.</p>

Firstly, there is the protection of vulnerable persons, particularly minors, who are surfing the web in ever-growing numbers, especially on social networks, where they can easily divulge their personal data. In the face of this, we demand that young people are made aware that responsible behaviour is indispensable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I strongly support the right of citizens to easily delete, correct or block their data, and to be informed of any possible misuse or errors in terms of data protection.

      <p sl="it">For these reasons, in the firm belief that the European Parliament has moved in the right direction to guarantee citizens a suitable level of protection, I fully support actions such as the introduction of the principle of accountability by means of the mandatory appointment of data protection officers and the application of severe and dissuasive sanctions, including criminal sanctions, for misuse and abuse of personal data.</p>

The existing legislation (which dates from 1995) must be updated and modernised in the face of the spread of new information and communication technologies. It will also ensure that the Commission’s future legislative proposal establishes a true ‘right to be forgotten’, meaning the right of individuals, under certain conditions, to have their personal data no longer collected, analysed, processed or used in any way, and deleted, especially in the world of online social networks.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur that we need to modernise data protection legislation due to the privacy challenges posed by new technologies. However, the problem is much greater than the report suggests. In certain EU Member States, including Lithuania, the problem is not just one of obsolete legislation, but implementation. Article 22 of the constitution of the Republic of Lithuania prohibits interference with a person’s personal correspondence or his life. According to a report published a few months ago in The American, in 2010, the Lithuanian State Data Protection Inspectorate investigated 270 allegations of arbitrary interference with privacy against government officials or companies. In the majority of complaints, the person stated that the government agency gathered or used their personal data, such as a personal code, without legal basis or explanation. We must restore confidence. It is important for citizens to know what happens to their data. European leaders must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure protection against loss of data or unauthorised access. It is a matter of honour and dignity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, it has overlooked some points, a few of which are quite alarming. The examples of ‘cloud computing’ (storing data on external platforms rather than on personal computers), scope for self-regulation by businesses, and agreements concerning international data transfer, are all cases in point. These agreements must reflect the same level of personal data protection as that provided within the Union. We know this is not the case in the United States in particular.

I welcome the adoption of this report which sets out a clear legislative framework, and which believes that the optimal use of tomorrow’s technologies should not undermine individual liberties.

The free movement of safe food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, as well as to their social and economic interests. With this regulation, we, the Members of the European Parliament, aim to serve both the interests of the internal market, by reducing the administrative burden, and benefit citizens by requiring clear, comprehensible and legible labelling of foods. Citizens must know what products they are eating, where they are produced and what their ingredients are. Food labelling must be easily recognisable, legible and understandable for the consumer.

It is vital that they make a conscious choice according to the benefits or drawbacks a food product can have for their health. This is why I think that, in future, efforts must be geared towards informing European citizens about the importance of reading all the items of information on food labels in order to maintain and guarantee a healthy lifestyle.

Therefore, I am glad that the rapporteur has found a compromise so that indications will be more legible and more detailed, products which can cause allergies will be mentioned on packaging in order to protect people suffering from allergies, and imitations will be identified as such (because it is, for example, unacceptable to deceive consumers by selling them cheese made from vegetable fat instead of milk), and so forth. Finally, I am very pleased that from now on, it will be obligatory to declare the country of origin for pork, sheep, goat and poultry meat on the packaging. Including this information will make consumers better informed and provide more effective protection against potential contamination. Furthermore, I am keen to reassure you: my political group has defeated the socialists’ ludicrous idea that all our products should be categorised according to their theoretical danger and bear a red, orange or green traffic light on the packaging.

I would stress the new provisions making it mandatory to include substances that cause allergies in the ingredients list; allergenic substances will also have to be provided for non-packed products. Country-of-origin labelling is becoming mandatory for fresh meat from pigs, goats, sheep and poultry.

      <p sl="it">In particular, I feel that the compromise reached, resulting from the interinstitutional trialogues, meets both the requirement for accurate consumer information and protection of the key role played by the food industry in processing raw materials to produce ‘Made in Italy’ products, which are recognised and established across the world.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Following the implementation of the new food labelling regulations, consumers will be able to make a fully informed and healthier choice when they are buying food. At a time when illnesses relating to food consumption are one of the biggest causes of mortality, it is important that products are purchased on an informed basis and consumers know exactly the quantities of fats, fatty acids, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins and salt they contain. Consumers will also know exactly the origin of certain foods, which it is not mandatory to specify at the moment. This is an important step at a time when product labels can very often be misleading. The new food labelling regulations will help educate European consumers, even though it will mean them spending more time at the shelves, learning what is healthy and what is not, and what ought to be eaten only occasionally. It is likely that, over time, there will also be a campaign to discourage those companies producing very unhealthy foods, which could see their sales fall as a result of detailed ingredient information being displayed. It is right that it will take at least 5 years for the European market to become standardised and for the new regulations to be implemented. However, it is better late than never.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I consider it a positive development that nutritional information does not have to be stated on the front of packaging. More room is thus left to producers to incorporate the name, logo and various marketing messages essential for ensuring the competitiveness of a product on the market. The consumer will also, for the first time, obtain information from the packaging on the origin of poultry, pork, mutton and lamb meat, which, particularly in the context of the recent avian influenza epidemic, is an important precondition for being able to make qualified decisions when purchasing products containing meat. All in all, I firmly believe that the compromise that has been reached balances the interests of consumers and producers, which is more the exception than the rule in the case of European regulations. The weak point of the new food labelling regulations, in my opinion, is the insufficient response to the problem of obesity, which is becoming the epidemic of the third millennium. It is a sensitive topic, particularly for inhabitants of the Czech Republic, more than two-thirds of whom suffer from obesity, and which is currently the second most overweight country in the EU. In such circumstances, I can imagine the possible implementation of an obligation to place a warning on the packaging of products containing excessive amounts of fat or sugar.

      <p sl="pt">Following negotiations with the Council, despite the proposal containing positive aspects, Parliament has ended up giving ground on others at second reading, with a view to reaching an agreement. We consider positive, inter alia, the points on the need for information on food additives with allergenic effects and mandatory origin marking for certain qualities of meat. However, we believe it was necessary to go further in this area of origin marking, extending it to all types of meat, including processed meat, to milk and its derivatives, and to single-ingredient products, including fruit and vegetables. We would stress again that information on genetically modified organisms should be mandatory.</p>

      <p sl="sk">With respect to nutrition labelling, the recent White Paper on a strategy for addressing nutrition, overweight and obesity-related issues in Europe emphasised the need for consumers to have access to clear, consistent and well-founded information. Nutrition labelling is an established method for providing information to consumers and should promote the health-conscious selection of foods. There is a broad consensus that the effectiveness of nutrition labelling can be strengthened as a means of promoting the ability of consumers to select a balanced diet. The parties concerned have presented several suggestions in support of front-of-pack information on nutritional value. The labelling systems in use differ in a way that may create obstacles to trading. The submitted proposal introduces certain general principles relating to the provision of information on foods and to the development of a regulatory mechanism aimed at enabling consumers to select foods on the basis of information. The mandatory requirements remain almost the same, but the Commission has the option of proposing new requirements for special issues. In an effort to take account of changes and developments in the area of information on foods, provisions need to be drawn up authorising the Commission to amend the list of mandatory information by adding or removing information, and making some information available by alternative means. Consultations with the parties concerned should enable prompt and well-targeted changes to be made to food information requirements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I subscribe to the report’s general philosophy of better information for consumers about the foods they purchase, particularly when it comes to the presence of ingredients which can cause allergies or indicating the origin of all types of meat. This last provision is entirely consistent with my belief that consumers should be allowed to choose products from the closest possible place to them. It is one of their legitimate aspirations: producing and consuming locally. It also avoids the CO2 emissions from long distance transport. It is odd that you never think about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have more reservations about nutrition declarations, a European attempt to control our plates, our behaviour and our culinary traditions. Finally, I am disappointed that the obligation to indicate the method of ritual slaughter, an amendment miraculously adopted by the committee several weeks ago, has turned into the possibility of starting to think about a potential report on this subject in several years’ time. Defenders of animal rights, secular people, agnostics, Christians and those who are indifferent will therefore continue to consume, without knowing it, meat produced in an entirely unnecessary manner according to practices that they reject, condemn or simply do not want to support. It is for that reason I abstained from voting on the compromise amendment.</p>

This concerns the origin, but also the nutritional value of foods and whether they contain allergens, among other things. From now on, the energy value and the levels of fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates and protein will be clearly visible on packaging. I also voted for Amendment 61 on mandatory labelling of country or place of origin for meat and poultry. This represents a major step forward for consumers, as labelling has often lacked sufficient detail in the past, leaving gaps in consumers’ information.

In accordance with the new legislation, the energy content and the amount of fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt has to be given on the package in the form of a legible table. The content of these ingredients has to be expressed per 100 g or per 100 ml. In addition, the content of these ingredients has to be expressed per portion of product.

Under this regulation, the name or address of the food business operator placed on the label does not constitute an indication of the country or place of provenance of the food product concerned. Food labels should be clear and understandable in order to assist consumers wanting to make better-informed food and dietary choices. Studies show that legibility is an important element in maximising the possibility that labelled information can influence its audience and that illegible product information is one of the main causes of consumer dissatisfaction with food labels.

People are paying much more attention to what they eat and there is a strong trend in the food sector towards eating local produce. There is also a boom in seasonal food. In particular, when diseases or pathogens are found in food, such as in the recent E. coli (EHEC) outbreak, people move increasingly to eating local products that they trust. In order to make it clear to consumers what they are actually eating, we need more transparency in food labelling. It should not be possible to use incomprehensible abbreviations which either confuse consumers or lull them into a false sense of security, in order to conceal the fact that certain ingredients are present. The same applies to country of provenance labelling. For these reasons, the EU intends to introduce a standardised, EU-wide, mandatory labelling system on food packaging. The same information must be provided everywhere. It must also be clearly legible and positioned and worded in such a way that absolute transparency for consumers is guaranteed. In my opinion, this is an important step towards helping people to have a good diet and, therefore, bringing about lasting improvements in the health of the population.

It consolidates and updates two areas of labelling legislation: the area of general food law covered by Directive 2000/13/EC, and that of nutrition labelling covered by Directive 90/496/EEC. The dossier was affected by the extensive tabling of amendments at each stage of the process (up to 800) and two major groups within Parliament: the rapporteur (partly supported by ECR) and the ‘opposition’ in the form of S&amp;D, Greens/EFA, GUE and partly ALDE.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Sommer’s draft report was substantially improved by Parliament. We supported the report both in plenary first reading and in ENVI second reading, as several of our key demands had been incorporated. The Council common position partly showed steps towards the Parliament position (e.g. country of origin), and, from a Green perspective, was better than the Parliament position on some issues (e.g. alcohol). The only ‘but’ is the inclusion of a text that says that Member States may stipulate that the particulars shall be given in one or more languages from among the official languages of the Union, which puts the non-official languages at risk.</p>

The free movement of safe goods is a fundamental aspect of the internal market; it contributes enormously to the health and prosperity of citizens and safeguards their social and financial interests. I believe that this fundamental aspect is covered by this report, as it protects consumer rights and its aim is to guarantee comprehensive information for consumers on the foods they choose to consume, alongside healthy competition.</p>

As such, not only do the energy content and the percentages of the various ingredients now have to be indicated, but labelling relating to the country of origin has been extended to more products compared with the previous directive. The new law, in addition to guaranteeing better consumer protection, also reduces bureaucracy, thus helping SMEs, which make up over 80% of the European food sector.</p>

It brings more clarity and openness for consumers. The model I have in mind is that of responsible consumers who are aware of what they are buying. However, that will only be the case when they also know what a product contains. Today’s decision will introduce standardised, mandatory nutrition labelling relating to per 100 g/100 ml amounts, thereby allowing consumers to compare products on the supermarket shelves. All the existing food labelling is voluntary, sometimes confusing and difficult to compare. Mandatory labelling which shows the nutritional value of foods will give consumers the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers are increasingly being misled or deceived about food. We only need to think of imitation cheese on pizza, reconstituted ham, ice cream that contains no milk and chocolate biscuits without chocolate. Often, cheap substitutes or aromas are used. All these imitation products must, in future, be labelled as such. The food labelling regulation is a major success on behalf of European consumers, which is why I have supported it.</p>

After three years of negotiations, she has succeeded in introducing a mandatory EU food labelling system which is manageable for SMEs. It is true that customers must also be informed in future about the substances which cause allergies that could be contained in loose, non-prepacked products. However, the Member States are entitled to decide for themselves how this is to be done. This means that every country can identify the solution which is best for its own businesses and consumers, for example, signs or discussions at the time of sale. German bakers and butchers already have very high standards in this respect. The EU is not imposing any other mandatory nutrition labelling requirements on products which are sold loose. A derogation has been granted for handcrafted food which is sold directly by the manufacturer in small quantities to end consumers or to local retailers who, in their turn, sell the products directly to end consumers. My group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has therefore been successful in bringing the interests of consumers and of manufacturers into line.

      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, penalties imposed for infractions committed in another Member State are those that most often go unenforced.

Citizens of other countries are also involved in these events, and they not infrequently underestimate the awful state of Poland’s roads.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Drunk drivers are a huge problem in many countries. Although the ambitious objective of reducing fatal accidents by half over the last decade has not been achieved, everything possible should still be done to increase the level of safety on the roads. The certainty of being punished for offences such as drinking and driving, failing to use seat belts or exceeding the speed limit committed in any of the EU’s Member States should definitely improve safety on the roads and reduce the risk to life associated with driving.

The Union will have safer roads once the directive has been enforced. This is a first very important step towards greater road safety and, given that it has been achieved after three years of negotiations, this makes it all the more important. We are moving towards the ideal situation where people who have committed offences or infringements will no longer get away with them simply because they do not live in the state where the act was committed. The authorities in the country where the act was committed will subsequently send offenders a registered letter to make them aware of the nature of their offence and the penalty which will be applied, as well as of possible methods of redress and the legal repercussions.

      <p sl="cs">Studies have shown that foreign drivers are responsible for a disproportionately high number of road accidents, and particularly those caused by speeding. The penalties imposed for offences committed on the territory of a Member State other than the one in which the offending driver is resident are very often not enforced, and this applies particularly to automatically recorded offences, the number of which has substantially increased with the expansion in automatic radar systems on Europe’s roads. This relative immunity undermines the fulfilment of objectives in the area of road traffic safety and casts doubt on the justification for these controls in the eyes of European citizens, who demand that resident and foreign drivers are treated in the same way. On the one hand, I welcome the fact that, at first reading, the Council transferred the legal basis from transport policy to police cooperation, since I regard the new legal basis as being neater in legislative terms. On the other hand, it concerns me that the Council has used these amendments to weaken the integration elements by removing references to enforcement procedures, and has limited its proposal to the exchange of information.

Penalties for offences committed by non-resident drivers are mostly avoided, particularly in the case of offences that are recorded automatically. This relative immunity undermines the objectives set out in the field of road safety, and weakens the legality of these controls in the eyes of European citizens, who may question them, given that everyone should be treated equally, regardless of whether they have permanent residence in a given state. The Commission’s aim is to facilitate the enforcement of penalties in the case of drivers who commit a speeding offence, drive under the influence of alcohol, fail to use safety belts or fail to stop at a red light in a foreign Member State.

Reckless drivers let loose in other countries will no longer go unpunished. Nevertheless, I am keen to warn against an ever-expanding police and surveillance system. For instance, I do not consider using a mobile telephone while driving as a serious offence.

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this text because too many Europeans are still dying on our roads each year. Globally, it is the leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 29. In its White Paper on European transport policy (2001), the Commission had the commendable objective of cutting by half the number of casualties on roads by 2010, but since 2005, the drop in the number of casualties has slowed down. In the Union, one of the problems is that the sanctions relating to offences committed in a Member State other than that of the driver are often dropped. This impunity weakens road safety objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was therefore essential to legislate in order to remove this inconsistency, by facilitating the application of sanctions against drivers who commit the most dangerous offences outside their own Member State.</p>

The Union is pursuing a policy to improve road safety with the objective of reducing fatalities, injuries and material damage. An important element of that policy is the consistent enforcement of sanctions for road traffic offences committed in the Union which considerably jeopardise road safety. Sanctions in the form of financial penalties for certain road traffic offences are often not enforced if those offences are committed with a vehicle which is registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place, etc. This directive aims to ensure that even in such cases, the effectiveness of the investigation of road safety-related traffic offences should be ensured. This directive also aims to ensure a high level of protection for all road users in the Union by facilitating the cross-border exchange of information on road safety-related traffic offences and thereby enforcing sanctions where those offences are committed with a vehicle registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place.</p>

Road rage does not stop at the borders of one’s country. Dangerous driving remains so outside that country. From now on, drivers will be held responsible wherever they are and systematically.

Violations of a wide range of road traffic rules, such as exceeding speed limits, failing to wear a safety belt or drink-driving, are causing large numbers of serious accidents. In 2001, the European Union set itself the ambitious target of reducing the number of road fatalities by half, which it was not able to achieve.

Although we have noticed a reduction in the number of deaths on our roads in the last decade, the number of accidents, particularly in the Baltic States, is too high.

This budget clearly supports the areas of scientific research and innovation, education, professional training, and encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises. Another innovative aspect is the creation of a fund for investing in future infrastructure, for example, energy, telecommunications and transport. I believe this budget, which is simpler and more flexible, will have a real impact on Europeans’ lives.</p>

The Article requires that all three institutions cooperate on finding a solution ‘throughout the procedure leading to the adoption of the financial framework’. Parliament has clearly explained its position regarding the Commission proposal in the oral questions of May 2010 and in its resolution of September 2010. The Council adopted its own proposal in December 2010, and asked Parliament to consent to this proposal on 18 January 2011, without commencing any negotiations with Parliament aiming to reach a common position. The Council pointed out in its letter that the proposal included the introduction of a certain measure of flexibility, in accordance with Parliament’s wishes. This offer is not enough. Parliament has insisted on a greater level of flexibility in view of increasing needs and reduced capacities, and the increased use of the flexibility instruments established in the interinstitutional agreement. None of its other demands concerning the 2011 budget got a hearing. It cannot therefore agree to this draft Council regulation laying down the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013.

With a budget of EUR 1 000 billion, which represents a 30% increase, the Commission is removing, for itself, the fiscal constraints that it imposes on the Member States. It is proposing to slash its bête noire, the common agricultural policy, whilst prohibiting its partial renationalisation, despite the issues of food self-sufficiency and safety being more important than ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is promoting policies whose operation and effectiveness are increasingly being called into question by the Member States and even by the Court of Auditors. The same is true, in particular, for those policies that feed into the Structural Funds. Now, regional policy, with its requirement for cofinancing, is an incitement to public spending. Its objective is, above all, to grease the palms of local bigwigs and to destroy the Member States.</p>

However, the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries. Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is scandalous. We do not need an inflated EU budget that may be up to ten times larger than necessary. We do not need a budget funded by EU taxpayers which is completely lacking in any awareness of the need for austerity measures, which will bring about a further increase in the Brussels bureaucracy and which will rob the net contributors of their last pennies. Instead, we should take every opportunity to make savings. Farming subsidies, the largest and most controversial item on the budget, should be renationalised.

Only with these two aspects – one of regulation and monitoring of public accounts, and the other of sustained growth – will Europe be able to escape the crisis and achieve the targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy. No state can manage to grow and be competitive without sustainable public finances. I would therefore re-emphasise the importance that we already have all the economic governance measures fully functioning by 2012, such as the new rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Semester for increased coordination of economic policies, and the new procedure regarding excessive macro-economic imbalances.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As such, I would reiterate the importance of realising new own resources capable of reinforcing the EU’s capacity for intervention and autonomy. The Commission should also table proposals as soon as possible relating to a common strategic framework (CSF) that includes the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), as well as a proposal relating to the European Social Fund as the key instrument for combating unemployment, and reducing social inequality and poverty thanks to improved education and vocational training.

      <p sl="sk">In view of the current economic, social and environmental crisis, strong European leadership and closer cooperation at EU level are more necessary than ever. The current approach to governance remains unbalanced. We must strengthen supervision of economic policies and ensure effective compliance with fiscal consolidation. We must also take appropriate steps to find a solution to macro-financial imbalances. Better coordination and harmonisation of tax policies are desirable, as well as an attempt at further measures leading to new revenues. It is important to supervise long-term investments in order to maintain sustainable economic growth. In this context, euro funds are also a correct and essential component of a balanced and strengthened economy.

While the rules of the Framework Agreement required the resolution to reflect the summary report produced by the Conference of Committee Chairs, the final resolution, supported by the EPP, S&amp;D and ALDE Groups, was instead merely a wish-list of vague long-standing political beliefs.

The regulation first introduced a unified legal basis for the control and prevention of TSE and BSE. The regulation consolidated all previous EU legislation in the area of TSE. It has been amended several times since it was introduced, and a number of supplementary measures have been added with the aim of further eradicating, controlling and monitoring TSE. In addition to this, there are other measures contributing to a comprehensive safety and surveillance regime for managing TSE. In my opinion, it is essential that consumer protection, animal health and TSE eradication remain the chief objectives and the top priorities when considering any changes to current legislation, and we must also continue the close monitoring of developments in the TSE family of diseases, in case of a repeat TSE or BSE outbreak. It is also essential to promote research in these areas, where our knowledge is still incomplete. Only in this way will it be possible to adopt well-founded policy decisions in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">In recent years, the agro-food industry has been marked by numerous epidemics, among which the most representative are certainly Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE), commonly known as ‘mad cow’ disease.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the mid-90s, the spread of this disease in the EU saw over 2 200 cases and, to date, has led to the deaths of 207 people. I should like to point out that this epidemic radically changed not only the European system for managing food crises, but also public awareness of these issues. Even today, over 10 years later, a survey conducted by Eurobarometer reveals that 62% of Europeans feel they cannot protect themselves against diseases such as mad cow disease.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore important that citizens know that in Europe, there is constant monitoring of spongiform diseases, which can offer prevention and guarantee, if necessary, rapid identification. I agree with the rapporteur as to the validity of the proposals tabled by the Commission on the TSE Road map 2.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I hope that the Member States together with the EU scrupulously apply the European legislation on feed and food.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The 1990s and 2000 were marked by the health scandal of mad cow disease. Whilst animal meal has been clearly identified as being at the origin of this disease, a majority of MEPs have voted in favour of the partial lifting of the ban on animal meal in Europe. As we know, given the devastating effects of this meal, this is extraordinary. I therefore voted against this report as, although the epidemic has all but disappeared, a great number of unknowns remain. There are other viable solutions and it would have been preferable to prioritise these, rather than reviving old formulas that have already caused so much damage. Do we wish to align ourselves with practices which have demonstrated in the past how dangerous they can be, or shall we commit to defending common sense and a European agricultural model that guarantees consumer safety? Together with the other members of the Democratic Movement, I therefore voted against this report to reaffirm my view that there should be no compromise on food safety and health.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The number of cases of mad cow disease (BSE) and other transmissible diseases such as scrapie (TSE) has decreased dramatically in recent years. This is important evidence that the EU’s TSE eradication measures have been successful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this downward trend must not lead to less stringent surveillance measures. This is why I voted against this report that recommends, subject to certain conditions, lifting the feed ban for non-ruminants, especially poultry, pigs and fish.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is real public concern about this issue and I believe that lifting the ban on feeding processed animal protein to non-ruminants, even subject to conditions, is neither justified nor free from health risks, such as cross-contamination in mixed livestock farms or in abattoirs.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, I fully agree with the rapporteur when she states that, considering the seriousness of the phenomenon, control and surveillance measures must, if anything, be strengthened.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because in 1997-1998, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) reached epidemic proportions in the EU due to cattle being fed with BSE contaminated processed animal proteins (PAP). In reaction to the BSE epidemic in the EU, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) was adopted and established for the first time in a uniform legal basis for the control and prevention of TSE and BSE. The regulation consolidated all previous EU legislation governing TSE. It has been amended several times since its introduction and several additional measures have been amended or introduced to further eradicate, control and monitor the spread of TSE. In addition, other measures contribute to a comprehensive safety and surveillance regime governing TSE. The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ‘The TSE Road Map 2: a strategy paper on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies for 2010-2015’ was published on 16 July 2010 and was welcomed by the European Parliament. However, the European Parliament underlines the importance of ensuring that the significant decline in BSE cases in the European Union does not lead to less stringent TSE measures or to a reduction in the strict control and surveillance mechanisms in the EU and takes note of the contribution of past and current TSE legislation to the eradication of TSE in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the 1990s, we experienced the nightmare of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a form of BSE. Since that time therefore, research in this field has been carried out continuously, and standards for breeding, feeding and the slaughter of animals have been made higher than ever. Despite the intensified activity and the real progress which has been made, scientific research has not shown that the danger has been completely eliminated from Europe, so there is no reason to significantly weaken legislation. After all, the safety of consumers is of primary importance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the question of protein deficit in the diet of ruminants remains important. EU legislation has established detailed standards governing the presence of animal protein in feed. However, in view of the insufficient amounts of protein crops grown in Europe, we are forced to import them from outside the Union, where high standards of production are not always maintained. The solution is a liberalisation of legislation on feed or a change in protein crop production policy (the Häusling report).</p>

The difficult time Europe went through during the BSE epidemic is still vivid in the minds of European citizens who, for the first time, found themselves confronted with a food scare, but also a collapse in production that devastated the economy of many rural areas. We therefore welcome the TSE Road Map 2, so that monitoring can continue effectively together with the development of ante-mortem and post-mortem rapid BSE-diagnostic tests, and with research dedicated to this animal health problem, which now forms part of an ugly chapter of European agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) are caused by a transmissible agent known as a prion which is an abnormal form of protein. This disease is extremely dangerous to people and animals. Although the European Union has recently seen a decline in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases, it is essential to maintain the same level of control of TSE and related feed and food and stringent surveillance mechanisms. At EU level, we must be in a state of constant readiness to stop an outbreak of this disease. I believe that the Commission should encourage research to develop rapid BSE-diagnostic tests. Furthermore, it is very important for the Commission to review the current threshold levels for dioxin in fish-meal. It should be noted that the limit currently permitted is too low, because it poses a threat to human and animal health.

The European Parliament advocates strict preconditions. Processed slaughterhouse waste must only be derived from species which are not linked to TSE. The production and sterilisation methods used to process the slaughterhouse waste must comply with the highest safety standards. The ban on intra-species recycling (‘cannibalism’) must remain in force. The production channels for slaughterhouse waste derived from different species must be completely separated. The separation of these production channels must be guaranteed by the competent authorities in the Member States and audited by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Before the ban on meat and bone meal is lifted, a reliable species-specific method must be put in place to identify the species origin of the proteins in animal feed so that ‘cannibalism’ and the feeding of animal meal to ruminants can be prevented.

I agree with the rapporteur that an integrated approach to aviation security is needed, with one-stop security so that passengers, luggage and cargo arriving at an EU airport from another EU airport do not need to be screened again. In the report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to propose adding body scanners, which should serve to speed up the pace and tempo of checks at airports and reduce inconvenience to passengers, to the list of authorised screening methods. I agree that appropriate rules and common minimum standards for their use must also be provided. I also believe that before adding body scanners to the list, an impact assessment should be carried out which demonstrates that the devices do not constitute a risk to passenger health, personal data or the individual dignity and privacy of passengers. The use of body scanners must be regulated by common EU rules, procedures and standards.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mr de Grandes Pascual, as I think that it deals with a subject of paramount importance in the context of the international fight against terrorism. I feel that the measure banning the boarding of aircraft with liquids was justified at the time it was adopted. Technology did not yet allow us to carry out rapid scans and prevention was the most effective solution for reducing the risk of attacks being carried out. With the prospect of this restriction being lifted in 2013, cooperation between European and national institutions must be stepped up. This is why a review needs to be carried out of the control mechanisms at airports to ensure the same level of security as at the moment. At the same time, it is important that passengers’ rights are respected, regardless of the type of new aviation security measures introduced. This means that the proportionality of the measures applied by states to their citizens must remain a priority in all circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since the report emphasises what health risks could arise from the implementation of new body scanners and then stipulates that they could be introduced only after thorough medical assessments have confirmed that they are not harmful to the human body, the report can be adopted and I am therefore voting in favour.</p>

Parliament is therefore taking up the challenge of analysing the measures adopted and proposing others where appropriate, with a view to preventing risks. Furthermore, international coordination on aviation security measures is needed in order to guarantee a high level of protection, whilst avoiding a situation where passengers are subjected to successive checks, with the restrictions and additional costs these entail. It is important to draw attention to the fact that while applying new technical measures aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also crucial to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, because those measures are not just about protecting citizens, but the impact on their rights and freedoms. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that this technical security arrangement really is safe, effective and reasonable. All body scanners should make use of a stick figure to protect passengers’ identities and to ensure that they cannot be identified through images of any part of their body. When Member States install body scanners, they must comply with the minimum standards and requirements.</p>

This is the second time the European legislative is sending out a message about this after it voted against the SWIFT agreement with the United States, which breaches European citizens’ right to personal data protection. It is important that MEPs have asked for the devices to respect passengers’ privacy and dignity and not to pose a health risk. At the moment, body scanners do not feature on the list of control methods and technologies capable of detecting objects hidden in clothing. This is the list drawn up as part of the EU legal framework for aviation security. The European Commission is due to propose a set of regulations which will add body scanners to the list of search methods authorised at EU level. However, this does not mean that Parliament will not have the opportunity to reject the proposal tabled by the Commission. The fact that these devices could affect passengers’ health is an important detail which needs to be resolved prior to approving any of these technologies.</p>

Several initiatives have been adopted to create an integrated approach to aviation security, so as to achieve a high level of security for the public.

This should include common technical standards and operational conditions which ensure that the inherent risk to personal data protection, to passengers’ privacy and dignity, and to human health is minimised.

The images generated should be stick figures, with the data being destroyed immediately after the individual has undergone the security check. The European Commission should table new European rules this summer. Parliament will have the option of rejecting them within three months in accordance with the comitology procedure.

      <p sl="de">It is important to make the deadline for introducing the new systems dependent on the technology being fully functioning rather than on a specified date. In addition, it must be possible to combine the new machines with systems for detecting liquids. I would also like to highlight the fact that issues of space and structural engineering need to be taken into consideration in the case of the control unit (in other words, the security scanner and the X-ray device). Major structural alterations will be needed at many airports to support the weight of the machine and to make the necessary space available.</p>

The democratic institutions involved therefore have an urgent obligation to adopt all measures necessary to ensure the safety of citizens. Decisions adopted in favour of security often entail the loss of certain freedoms and, in any case, cause inconvenience, annoyance and a change to normal rules of behaviour. It is a sad fact that, among the values of modern societies, security is a value that has to be protected, because it is not guaranteed. Civil aviation security is undoubtedly one of the most important issues for the European Union. The EU’s regulatory framework in the area of aviation security establishes a list of methods and technologies for detection and other checks, but the current legislation has to be amended in order to incorporate security scanners into the list. These scanners seem to be an appropriate means of improving aviation security, contributing to the effectiveness of security controls at EU airports. Detection checks, intelligence services and security services, the exchange of police information and analysis of the human element are key factors forming part of the definition of the concept of aviation security and comprise an integrated whole. It is essential to focus all efforts on protecting democratic values and on combating terrorism, which is a threat to these values.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Aviation security is a topic of endless discussion. It includes the safe transport of people (performing checks on people and baggage), and of freight and postal items. Which materials can be potentially dangerous? Liquids, gels and aerosols with a volume ‘greater than 100 ml’, firearms and explosives, and solid objects of a certain shape and size (for example, small nail scissors). The author of the report overlooks the fact that the European Commission has not found anyone who would justify this technically non-sensical regulation – a general ban on liquids, aerosols and gels (LAGs) on board aircraft – requested by the European Parliament for the seventh year. By the way, there are no similar regulations for underground trains or high-speed trains, despite the fact that passenger numbers and the risk of attack are comparable. Security scanners have two important unofficial functions. They are good business for the suppliers, and provide employment for large numbers of people. Their ‘reliability’ is not 100%, despite considerable technical progress. The question is: what are we really looking for? Are we capable of detecting the items we are looking for with the desired level of probability? This is the weak point of the whole operation, I suspect, and I have considerable doubts about it. As far as the matter of LAGs is concerned, I see in the background the exorbitant prices of drinks on board aircraft and in airports. I can see no other rational reason for the 100 ml limit on fluids. Despite my reservations regarding scanners, I think that many parts of the report are rational, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is therefore supporting it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Whilst security scanners or body scanners have been an undeniable step forward for aviation security as they allow the detection of banned items hidden under clothing, they should not be introduced without extreme precautions. On the one hand, citizens’ health must be safeguarded and therefore I support the ban on monitoring technologies that use ionising radiation. On the other hand, the dignity and privacy of individuals must be protected. Therefore, it is essential, if we are to add security scanners to the list of approved inspection methods, that only stick figures are permitted, that the data are destroyed and that it is possible to refuse to submit to such a check. The use of these scanners must be harmonised and subject to common protection rules that guarantee respect for fundamental rights in each Member State that chooses to introduce this system. Regular updates of the standards will be necessary to cope with new risks, technological developments and any resulting negative effects. Moreover, lifting the ban on the carrying of liquids, aerosols and gels in 2013, and instead having a system for inspecting these substances, is, in my view, highly appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="et">It was confirmed in yesterday evening’s debate that air safety is a highly important and relevant topic. I am very pleased that this report was adopted today, and I just want to repeat why I think it is important. 1. According to Eurostat data, there were 751 million air passengers in the European Union in 2009. Security in aircraft and airports must be ensured for them and for many others. 2. Security scanners must protect passengers’ identities and ensure that they cannot be identified through images of any part of their body. 3. Data generated by the scanning process must not be used for purposes other than that of detecting prohibited objects, may be used only for the amount of time necessary for the screening process, must be destroyed immediately after each person has passed through the security control and may not be stored. 4. For the health and safety of travellers and employees, it is important to use technology which is the least harmful to human health. Furthermore, exposure to cumulative ionising radiation should not be permitted in the future, and should therefore be explicitly excluded from use. I think that this report on air safety, and security scanners in particular, is necessary in order to ensure the rational and justified use of new technologies. I therefore supported the adoption of this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Fortunately, the report covering the use of security scanners at airports has been improved considerably when it comes to the protection of privacy. Thus, the report no longer expresses a clear preference for body scanners but instead allows for other security screening technologies to be used. These technologies must also be guaranteed not to adversely affect the health or fundamental rights of passengers. As a result, data gathered from screening of this nature may only be used in that context and must be deleted immediately for reasons of privacy. Another restriction is that there must be no use of profiling. Screening must take place on a random basis and there must certainly not be any selection on the basis of specific characteristics. Finally, X-ray technology is prohibited on the grounds of the health of both passengers and workers. Our group also proposed forcing a revision of the Groundhandling Directive. I gave my full backing to this report because it had been significantly improved in large part due to amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The security of civil aviation is an issue that the EU cannot neglect, since globalisation, for all its positive aspects, also opens the door to international criminals and terrorist acts, with unforeseeable consequences for public safety. Nonetheless, and given that 100% security is impossible, there is a need to impose mechanisms that safeguard security but, at the same time, do not threaten fundamental rights. In this specific case, the introduction of security scanners in European airports will not just enable the reinforcement of security, but will also reduce passenger disruption. The introduction of these scanners through harmonised rules for the whole EU, which regulate conditions and common standards for detection performance, will also take into account health risks for passengers and staff. I believe it is important to commit to the technological development of scanners for uniform application in all the Member States, not least as regards restrictions imposed on liquids, aerosols and gels since 2006. Another point I would like to stress is closer monitoring of cargo and post originating in third countries, by exchanging best practices, sharing information and training airport staff.</p>

However, it places excessive emphasis on a range of ‘human rights’ concerns and insists on regular mention of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we opposed and which is now yet another of the baleful consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon. By definition, effective security measures must be ‘discriminatory’ – they must be targeted primarily against those most likely to fit the current threat profile. This will not just be a matter of race, or religion or place of origin – although these may be important factors – but also of behaviour and other aspects. Security measures that alienate the innocent travelling public but do not focus on the most likely suspects are counter-productive.

Of course, semantic precautions are taken to make the use of body scanners, referred to as ‘security scanners’, admissible in airports; their use is surrounded by privacy and data protection ‘safeguards’ (the option of not submitting to the scan and going through a checking process, a very remote image viewing room, restricted data storage, among other things).</p>
      <p sl="fr">As always with the use of technologies that call into question data protection and privacy, the issues of purpose and proportionality arise. Reducing the terrorist threat depends on the resolution of the political causes at the root of terrorism and on strengthening the human resources allocated to the services concerned: victims, just like others – despite the optical illusions – of austerity policies. The proliferation of ever-more sophisticated technological resources is somewhat illusory.

The representation of women in business management roles, in business leadership, and in the various bodies which regulate businesses, is, unfortunately, low.

The statistics show clearly that women are not sufficiently represented, particularly in managerial positions. The introduction of legal regulations in this area is important, particularly when businesses themselves do not want to adopt measures for promoting the appointment of women to managerial positions, in line with the concept of the social responsibility of business. The motion also underscores the necessity of creating a suitable mentoring and training network for women. The key to increasing the number of women in managerial positions is also to introduce an appropriate system of support, making it possible for women to balance their family life with their professional life.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I agree with the opinion that it is incumbent on policy makers at both EU and Member State level and on companies to remove the barriers to women joining the labour market generally and management bodies in particular, and to offer women equal opportunities so that they can obtain senior posts, with a view to ensuring that all existing resources are efficiently utilised, that women’s skills and strengths are channelled to best effect, that the best possible use is made of the Union’s human potential, and that the EU’s core values are defended, given that equality is a fundamental principle. I abstained from the vote because the report stresses that if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate, legislation, including quotas, should be proposed by 2012 to increase female representation in corporate management bodies to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, while taking account of the Member States’ responsibilities and of their economic, structural (i.e. company size), legal and regional specificities. I do not feel that it makes sense to set quotas in the field of business.</p>

I am pleased to see that the report contains proposals on improving the number of women on the management boards of leading listed companies. In particular, I appreciate the fact that the Commission is invited to propose legislation containing quotas by 2012 in order to make progress on this subject. My country, France, has established quotas which have already produced very positive results. I feel that it is important to promote gender equality on management boards in order to create real equal career opportunities within companies. We also need to recognise women’s skills, and how their talents can contribute to business management. Above all, I believe that we urgently need to remedy the iniquitous pay differential whereby women earn 17% less than men, which I feel is an aberration. Perception of women in the workplace has to change: our economy cannot afford to ignore the potential for development and competitiveness that parity, equal gender representation and equal opportunities can provide.</p>

It is worth highlighting the fact that equal rights for women and men are one of the European Union’s leading principles. Differences can currently be seen in the employment of women, particularly as regards high-ranking positions. Women earn less than men for performing the same jobs, and the gender-based imbalances can be seen clearly from employment statistics for managerial positions. According to the data, the vast majority of the highest-ranking positions on company boards are held by men, but it is evident that women are making ever bolder advances towards these prestigious and well-paid jobs. Personally, I support all measures aimed at removing these barriers, and I therefore voted in favour of adopting the report.</p>

In my opinion, the measures called for in the report are ideologically motivated attempts to force women onto the labour market, which will result in falling wage levels. Quotas for women will simply result in token women being appointed, which will harm the economy. Well-qualified, competent women will find their own way into management positions. They do not need the measures described in the report to achieve this. We do not expect from men what we expect from women, which is to combine child care with a job.

The principle of equal pay for equal work must be defended by the trade union movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the progress achieved by the women’s and trade union movement on women’s rights, women still carry the biggest share of domestic tasks, child care and care for elderly or ill members of the family.

I would like to explain briefly why I voted against paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b. The figures on the proportion of women in management positions are shameful. Therefore, I am fully convinced that we finally need to take targeted measures to bring about a significant increase in this proportion. However, I feel that the calls made in paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b go too far. I do not believe that we should intervene in the operational management of businesses or set quotas even for the board of directors. Therefore, we should first of all call on companies to take voluntary measures. In particular, I think that 2012 is far too early for the introduction of legislative provisions and quotas.

Although many structural barriers have been removed through legislation in order to promote gender equality in corporate management, men continue to predominate in leadership positions. Today, only one out of 10 board members of the largest companies listed on the national stock exchanges of EU Member States is a woman, and progress has been slow in recent years. The disparity is widest at the very top, where only 3% of such companies have a woman directing the highest decision-making body.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States and the Commission should consider introducing new policies enabling more women to become involved in managing companies, in particular, by: initiating a dialogue with the management of large companies about ways of increasing female representation; supporting initiatives to assess male-female equality on recruitment committees and in other areas, e.g. with regard to wage differentials and career patterns and developing women’s individual capabilities in-house, by means of specific further training courses and other forms of professional support, in order to prepare them effectively for management duties.</p>

A mandatory quota will interfere on a large scale with companies’ freedom to do business and is therefore questionable from a constitutional perspective. In addition, an across-the-board quota does not take into consideration the specific circumstances of each company and industry. For example, it would not currently be possible to impose a standard quota in the construction, engineering or IT industries in Germany. In this area, it is essential to focus initially on training and study opportunities in order to bring about a significant increase in the proportion of young women employed in these traditionally male-dominated industries. In addition, we need to improve conditions for working parents, in particular, by introducing family-conscious, flexible work models and developing the child care infrastructure.

Special action needs to be taken to enable qualified and educated women to reach positions that are difficult for them to reach at present. Norms regarding self-regulation and good governance are an excellent method for achieving this.

Indeed, although some States have adopted interesting measures, the Union as a whole needs constructive regulatory input. European legislation could set a 30% quota for female representation in decision-making bodies by 2015 and 40% by 2020. The merit of the Parliamentary motion for a resolution, which I support, is that these measures would be accompanied by measures designed to achieve a better balance between work and family life, to tackle the gender pay gap and to encourage more flexible working hours.

As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to draw your attention to two matters in particular. The first of these is the significant imbalance between the number of women and men in decision-making bodies. Men account for 89% of the members of management and supervisory boards in Europe. According to Eurostat research, in the third quarter of 2010 women made up barely 37% of all managers and higher-ranking officials in Poland. The boards of public limited companies and supervisory boards have an even lower female representation (around 12% in 2009).</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of these sad statistics, I would call on companies and the Member States (in line with paragraph 1 of the resolution) to act quickly on a voluntary basis to increase the proportion of women in the highest ranks. Otherwise, I support the Commission’s suggestion to put forward a proposal for EU legislative acts on this matter. The second matter concerns the differences in pay for men and women in managerial positions. According to the Polish Salary Survey, in Poland, men’s average pay was over 33% higher than women’s, while the difference was around 25% in managerial positions. The resolution we have voted on today calls on the Member States to adopt regulations on this issue as a matter of urgency.

This report pays most attention to the representation of women on the boards of medium and large companies. However, this is a much broader issue, particularly in Lithuania. According to Eurostat data, more than 91% of Lithuanian women have been educated at secondary and higher levels, the highest rate in the EU. At the same time, less than 17% of Lithuanian women become CEOs, and only 18% of them are elected to Parliament, while there are practically no female university rectors. Having a female President is not enough. There needs to be a rapid response in order to avoid a drain of talent and skills into the EU workforce.

Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Commission has recently launched a number of initiatives with the aim of recognising and making use of women’s potential, energies and capabilities. This will benefit the European economy, as studies show that bringing women into companies and into top management positions improves productivity and efficiency and produces better financial results.

That is why it attempts to attribute the crisis to speculation (as if that were not a structural component of capitalism itself), to credit rating agencies, to ‘irresponsible lending practices’, in other words, to secondary aspects of the capitalist economy, in order to acquit the capitalist system and ignore the fact that it is rotten to the core. The solutions proposed by the political representatives of the monopolies revolve around the central strategic objective of the EU and the bourgeois governments: to safeguard and maximise the profitability of capital, reduce the price of labour to the absolute minimum, demolish any labour and social rights of the working classes and strengthen the position of the euro-unifying monopolies in global competition between the imperialists.</p>

Against the backdrop of the growing sovereign debt and states’ inability to rebalance public spending, there is increasingly frequent talk about the concept of democracy by credit or governance by loan, which is a typical feature of certain EU Member States. The critical time has not passed for these Member States. This is precisely why I think, along with the rapporteur, that present or future systemic risks need to be very closely monitored by the authorised institutions. We need to restore the balance within Europe so that we can take steady steps towards exiting the grey area of the effects triggered by the crisis.

The financial and economic crisis has resulted in unemployment for 23 million economically active people (9.6% in total), and a youth unemployment rate of 21%, while 17% of EU citizens risk falling into poverty. The crisis has made clear the need for progress towards establishing genuine economic governance of the Union, consisting of a systematic set of policies designed to ensure sustainable growth, good stable jobs, budgetary discipline, the correction of excessive macro-economic imbalances, competitiveness and productivity in the EU economy, and stricter regulation and supervision of financial markets, as well as a suitable mechanism for resolving the financial crisis. I agree with the report’s observation that credit rating agencies played a significant role in deepening the financial crisis through the allocation of incorrect ratings to structured finance instruments which had to be downgraded.

In order to achieve this, there is a need to expand a Union budget able to respond to the new needs and challenges, because the costs of prolonging the crisis will be extremely high for everyone, as can be seen in the Commission forecast, which reveals that output will fall by about 4.8% of gross domestic product by 2013 and will be significantly lower over the next decade than it has been over the last 20 years.

The essential issue is that the most negative features and consequences of the current European integration process, whose nature and content are strongly neoliberal, are being exacerbated. These are the reinforced criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact and the so-called ‘Euro Plus Pact’, with more attacks on rights and social regression; it is so-called ‘economic governance’, which is an attack on democracy itself; and it is the Europe 2020 strategy, with the parade of more liberalisations, privatisations and deregulation that it provides for.</p>

In this context, all the indications are that we will not manage to avoid fundamental reform of the EU budget. It was clear more than three decades ago that currency union requires a larger budget than the EU has at present. The budget needs its own sources, and we must take into account the serious long-term implementation of budgetary policies at EU level. This is therefore one of the most key requirements at present. Measures to limit capital flows, however, and an emphasis on support for the real economy, are also important. In my opinion, the stronger role of the UN is an extremely positive move – the EU can be a valid part of a multilateral world.

      <p sl="pl">The debate on how we should emerge from the current economic crisis has coincided with the start of the Polish Presidency of the EU Council. While listening to today’s parliamentary debate on these issues, I noted that the opinion of the rapporteur responsible for the report on how to emerge from the economic crisis, Mrs Berès, who belongs to my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, largely reflects what the Polish authorities have said in connection with the newly inaugurated Presidency. I am thinking of the call for a more integrated, not a more diffuse European Union to be the response to the economic crisis. In my opinion too, this statement should form the basis for the EU’s ‘anti-crisis’ measures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to note that the very sensible but, at the same time, controversial proposal put forward by our political group, namely, that the EU budget should be increased to a level of 5-10% of GDP, may gain wider recognition in future, at the conference planned by Poland on the future financial framework, in which both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will participate. I believe that it is a very fortunate coincidence that the proposals of the S&amp;D Group, as outlined in the Berès report, are viewed positively by the government of the country which currently holds the EU Presidency, in spite of the fact that it is part of a different political family. I therefore voted in favour of the report, and I also hope that its proposals will be implemented before the end of the Polish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as drafted by my colleague, Pervenche Berès, as it proposes ambitious yet practical solutions to help the EU come out of the financial, economic and social crisis from which European citizens are suffering on a daily basis. It is only by implementing Europe-wide solutions, such as issuing Eurobonds, which will enable more effective management of sovereign debt, greater investment in education, research and vocational education and the establishment of sound, effective economic governance, that Europe will be able to come out of this crisis for good.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges of 8 June 2011, Parliament called for EU budget resources to match the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, this message was regrettably not repeated in the final version of the Crisis Committee’s report. If we are to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, boost Europe’s economy and promote employment, we will certainly need a substantial increase in the EU budget over the next few years.</p>

I am particularly pleased with the idea of creating a Eurobond system, and that of establishing a European energy community. I also welcome the creation of a European treasury, which would provide a means of pooling debt, and would be led by a Commission Vice-President who could coordinate European monetary policy effectively. Nonetheless, it is regrettable that the amendment on increasing the EU budget with a view to boosting growth, employment, innovation and investment, within the framework of the EU 2020 strategy, was rejected in the plenary vote.

      <p sl="pl">The economic crisis which has disrupted the functioning of the European Union in recent years has affected not only the financial sector, but also the social sector, since a drop in employment, lower incomes and higher prices are problems which affect every European. The threat to the financial stability of many enterprises has resulted in many factories and companies going into liquidation, and the public debt of certain countries has given rise to strikes and demonstrations, and continues to do so. The work of the specially appointed parliamentary committee on the crisis is therefore extremely significant. The key achievements of this committee include developing savings programmes, drafting agreements, initiating cooperation with national parliaments and coordinating the operation of governance mechanisms in a crisis situation. All measures aimed at counteracting the effects of the crisis, such as restoring balance on the market, reducing unemployment and ensuring sustainable development, absolutely deserve our support.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European economic crisis has been under the microscope of academics and politicians and, although outwardly, people have tried to show a united front, it has been bubbling away under the surface the whole time. Recently, there have been more and more views on debt restructuring, which, just six months ago, was rejected as being completely out of the question. More and more, however, people have been inclined to think that such arrangements are inevitable. The debate has switched from a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to whether, sooner or later, they will be the lesser of two evils.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The unsustainable political culture in the countries in crisis, as well as their incapacity for self-regulation, have resulted in irresponsible housekeeping and a chronic budget deficit. The corrective measures will be painful, and a fair share of the burden will fall on politicians. By ‘fair’, I mean that those who have benefited from the bubble over the last decade will suffer to the same degree when it bursts. A standard of living acquired through debt and deceit is not genuine, and it cannot become so at the expense of others.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we speak of coherence and solidarity, it is worth bearing in mind that the EU Treaties explicitly state that the Member States are not liable for the debts of others. This report contains elements that threaten to conflict with these specific points. The promissory notes issued by the Union would represent joint and several liability, which would not only allow people to live above their means at EU level, but would also dilute political liability for indebtedness, so that it no longer becomes the immediate responsibility of the governments of the Member States and their citizens. I do not think that any increase in joint and several liability is something that we want, before an overwhelming majority of EU politicians understand that, in the longer term, no one can live beyond their means.</p>

One matter of concern is the current situation of young people in the European Union with an unemployment rate of 21%, while in some Member States, this figure even passes the 40% mark. This makes them the main group affected by the economic crisis. I think that the main job creation efforts must focus on creating employment for the young workforce. To achieve this, we have to incorporate the needs of young people into EU employment strategies, devise programmes intended to provide young people with the skills they need in the real economy, promote opportunities for them to specialise or work in another Member State, not to mention support the development of the entrepreneurial spirit among young people through providing specific vocational training, access to EU funds and business advice.</p>

We can no longer delay decisions on creating jobs and incentivising the employers creating them. Not only do we have to support foreign firms investing in the EU, but local employers creating new jobs. High labour costs represent one of the most serious obstacles to establishing new businesses and increasing employment. Lower labour taxation would stimulate investment. Furthermore, it is crucial to increase investment in research and development. The instability of farm and food prices is another problem that demands immediate solutions.

In particular, I should like to stress that union and solidarity are fundamental for Europe to successfully overcome the global challenge, and in that sense, I welcome the reference made in the report to Eurobonds. The current European national bond market is extremely fragmented; the mutual issuance of Eurobonds may get round this fragmentation by creating a new European market with a global dimension. The lack of a strong and substantial European bond on the global markets penalises the whole Union, including states with healthy public finances. Any solution, though, must avoid countries with responsible budgetary policies being forced to rescue, in one way or another, ‘undisciplined’ states. The concept of Eurobonds is based on solidarity but they must not become an instrument to reward unsound policies and to weaken incentives towards greater future budgetary prudence by states.</p>

I would like to stress my vote in favour of an increase in the EU’s budget to reach 5-10% of the EU’s GDP and thereby make progress in the political and economic integration of the continent. I think that the foreign and defence policy should be run by the EU as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Two significant factors caused the economic crisis in the EU and the decline in its global competitiveness: namely, excessive Member State budget deficits and unfair internal competition.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The EU has not complied with its own criteria in relation to budget spending. Unequal direct payments to farmers and incomplete cohesion policy, which has been unable in these last 12 years to eliminate significant economic and social divergences between Member States, are the first issues we must tackle if we wish to achieve sustainable development and a uniform improvement in the welfare of our citizens throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="lv">This report makes several important proposals, including cutting Member State budget deficits, supervision of financial transactions and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, it places too much emphasis on the ‘Europeanisation’ of financial and economic policy, including harmonisation of tax systems throughout the EU, which would not only deprive Latvia of the ability to make its own decisions concerning these processes, but also take away one of the major advantages of its tax policy, namely, attracting new investment. I also find the rapporteur’s proposal to increase the EU budget to a level between 5% and 10% of EU gross domestic product, focusing its revenue on VAT and increased contributions from Member States, unacceptable. Far from improving the economic situation in the EU, this would have exactly the opposite effect. It would deepen the imbalances between Member States and place a disproportionate burden on the smallest states, which have also suffered most from the economic crisis. For these reasons, I voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the last time I spoke in this Parliament in early May, I said that statements should, and could, be made but that the priority was action.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will remember that I announced my intention to establish a European Union office in Benghazi. The European Union flag now flies above the courthouse in the newly-named Freedom Square: a symbol not just of our solidarity with its people, but of our practical commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The office is now up and running and experts are arriving each week, working to see how we can support the security needs of the people and build the capacity of civil society. Last week, my team was in New York, coordinating our work on Libya with the UN.</p>
      <p sl="en">Outside the courthouse in Freedom Square, I met some of the people who have been bringing democracy to life in Libya. They thanked me, they thanked you and they thanked the European Union. They know that we will stay with them over time. Today, I am sure you join me in saluting again the enormous courage of the Libyan people, whether in Benghazi, Misrata, the Western Mountains, Tripoli or in the South.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have stepped up sanctions to stop arms and money reaching the regime. We have provided almost EUR 140 million of humanitarian assistance to those most in need. We continue to work for a political resolution to the conflict, in the Contact Group – which will meet in Istanbul this week – and in the Cairo Group, where, at our instigation, we continue to work with the UN Secretary General and the Special Envoy, Mr Al Khatib, the Arab League, the African Union and the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation, where we prepare for the days, weeks and months after Gaddafi leaves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Actions must be rooted in strategy. The EU was the first to offer a serious response to the Arab Spring, with our partnership communication in March 2011. Two months later, we launched a new and ambitious European Neighbourhood Policy. I am delighted to have Stefan Füle with me today – my close and trusted partner in conceiving this new policy and on ensuring delivery on our promises.</p>
      <p sl="en">You know the core principles of the policy: mutual accountability; individual approaches to individual countries depending on circumstances and aspirations and offering more support for more reform. In Stefan’s words: ‘more for more’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has financial backing to match, in the form of an extra EUR 1.2 billion for the next two years, on top of the EUR 5.7 billion already pledged – so, nearly EUR 7 billion. To this we should add a sum in the region of EUR 7-8 billion, the result of the concerted efforts I initiated to unlock new investment funds from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The goal is clear: the promotion of what I call ‘deep and sustainable democracy’ and – with it – economic prosperity. We know full well that democracy is hollow without food, safety, and jobs. So now is the time for all of us – for the institutions and the Member States – to deliver on those shared objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beyond the new policy, I have taken two further regional initiatives since we last met. First, to enhance our effectiveness, presence and visibility, I have appointed an EU Special Representative for the southern Mediterranean: Bernardino León. His task will be to assist us in strengthening the EU’s political influence in the region – in dialogue with governments, civil society and international organisations – and to cooperate closely with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, I have established a Task Force to draw together our work and bring in the European Investment Bank, the EBRD, other international financial institutions and other international partners, to turn commitments into reality, to synchronise and work closely together. That reality is about the democracy and the economy we wish to see on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Tunisia and Egypt, we see the evidence of the economic upheavals of the last months. When I was in Egypt a few days ago, I talked to shopkeepers, to people in the streets and to people running hotels. All tell me the same story: that revenues in tourism and foreign direct investment have fallen and that they need support to revive and sustain the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, for instance, we are supporting a major Egyptian social housing initiative, and why we are launching a major programme to support the poorest areas in the greater Cairo region, as well as a EUR 20 million programme to support Egyptian civil society. We are ready to help Egypt reform its security sector, and we have offered EU election observation and assistance and support for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I talked with Deputy Prime Minister El Gamal, who is leading the electoral process and the drafting of the constitution. An eminent lawyer, it falls to him to sort out a constitution that, in my words, will be the ‘guardian for the people’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, in Tunisia, I met with Foreign Minister Kefi on Friday. Support for civil society and for the preparation of October’s Constituent Assembly elections is well under way. We have been asked to deploy an election observation mission and will do so. Security reform and regional development programmes are also in motion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government in Tunisia, meanwhile, advances its own reform agenda. We applaud the consensus that was reached on the date for the elections and the fact that the principle of male-female parity for the lists of candidates has been retained.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am concerned that the voice of women should continue to be heard and their engagement certain. There is a fear, expressed to me, that, having taken part in their revolutions, their place in their future is not guaranteed. We need to support them: practically, by offering our resources, and politically by making it clear that we expect to see their engagement. A few weeks ago, we funded a conference with UN Women in Tunisia to bring together women across the region to consult and gain strength from each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is, of course, more to do – and this morning I have issued a statement of concern on the recent arrests of women journalists, artists and women’s rights defenders in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">But perhaps our greatest concern is for the people of Syria, who are denied the right to play their part in charting their country’s future. What began as small local demonstrations against corruption in the local communities has become a national outpouring, and it has been met with violence and repression.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday in Homa, 1l people died, adding to the total of over 1500 civilians and 350 security personnel who have lost their lives. Ten thousand people have been detained. We condemn without reservation those acts of violence and repression.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since we last met, I have increased our sanctions twice. I have continued to make our voice heard, worked with our international partners and sought action at the Security Council with the objective of sending a single message: to stop the violence, create the dialogue, and prepare for change.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Assad’s promises of reform and dialogue remain weak. Just recently, he announced that a committee will meet to prepare the framework for a dialogue. But let us be clear: any dialogue has to be inclusive, and that means the opposition taking part and all participating without fear.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our EU delegation remains on the ground in Damascus, meeting every day with individuals and groups, working with other representatives and sending out our messages.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our delegation in Ankara has been visiting the refugees who have arrived over the border in Turkey in their thousands. I have been in close touch with Foreign Minister Davutoglu of Turkey to offer support in the future, should they need that, and to discuss with him the political situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">That instability in Syria has echoes in Lebanon. We are following the indictments of the special tribunal and must now carry forward its work.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings us to the search for peace in the Middle East, between Israel and Palestine. The changes in the surrounding neighbourhood, the speech of President Obama in May, the moves towards Palestinian reconciliation, the approaching UN General Assembly: all those bring a renewed focus on the possibility of talks and a solution. I have worked tirelessly for this possibility – working closely with President Abbas, Prime Minister Fayyad and Prime Minister Netanyahu and with many others in the region, with our Quartet partners and with the Arab countries – to look for a strong and ambitious consensus, in which the EU plays the leading role this Parliament wishes us to play.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN, the US and Russia responded to my letter requesting a Quartet meeting, which will take place in Washington on Monday. That will build on the process that began with the Quartet meeting in Munich which I chaired earlier this year. Since then, the envoys have met intensively and, for the first time, with the negotiators from both sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not underestimate the challenge, but my objective is absolutely clear: to try to find a way to adopt a statement next week that will help the Israelis and Palestinians to bridge the gap and allow for a return to the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many look to September and the prospects for a resolution. We do not yet know what a UN resolution might say and what reaction it might bring. But I am clear that my energies should focus on using this time to get the talks moving and, on that, the European Union is united. We have a strong position from which to move forward, based on the Council conclusions, a united position.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also understand very well the concerns for the people of Gaza, having visited twice and seen the situation for myself. I have consistently stressed the need for the crossings to open, to provide what people need, and to ensure the security that Israel needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is there that our energies should lie. I am encouraged that, having spoken to the Prime Minister of Israel in the last few days, meetings are now taking place on the ground. But I do not underestimate the fact that there is much more to do. I thank Greece for its offer to route humanitarian aid to Gaza, in coordination with the UN.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now want to turn to two kingdoms, Morocco and Jordan, where the EU supports and encourages the strong commitment to reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 12 June 2011, King Abdullah of Jordan outlined ambitious reform proposals concerning political parties and the electoral process. I have been in regular contact with Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh with regard to this reform agenda, most recently during my last visit to Jordan two weeks ago. Finally, this past weekend, there was good news from Morocco, with a referendum endorsing the new constitution on Saturday.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reforms proposed are a significant response to the legitimate aspirations of the Moroccan people. I now hope that Moroccan citizens will remain at the centre of the implementation process, and that the dialogue will now widen and strengthen. We are ready to give Morocco full support in this endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Algeria, the state of emergency has been lifted, and the President’s promises of reform now need to become action – something I raised with Foreign Minister Medelci recently when we met at the EU-Algeria Association Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Bahrain, we have continued to express concern at the persistence of human rights violations. Honourable Members will remember that I discussed this with the King of Bahrain in the Gulf a few weeks ago. We see trials lacking in due process, the handing down of death sentences and the disgraceful treatment of doctors who have tried to help those in need.</p>
      <p sl="en">There may be some steps in the right direction. I saw that an independent international commission of inquiry into the events of the past few months has now been established. That is in response, in part, to the calls that we have made. But we need to remain vocal and strong in order that the national dialogue can finally get under way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I turn to Yemen. Crippled by political stalemate and worsening humanitarian and economic conditions, the only way forward – as I discussed with the President before he was injured, and as we continue to send messages from our delegation – is a truly inclusive political transition, in line with what the Gulf Cooperation Council have put forward in their initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to work closely with our partners, with the United States and with the Council, to try to unblock the situation and find a solution. As President Saleh begins to recover, he must transfer power and follow through on his commitment to the transition.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made it clear that we are ready, alongside our international partners, to provide further humanitarian, political and practical support. But I do not need to tell honourable Members just how difficult the situation is in Yemen and how concerned and alarmed we are by events on the ground. We are also ready to help prepare for elections and to establish a working Parliament there. But there is no question that, if Yemen is to move forward, that transition has to begin now.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to close by thanking this Parliament for its steadfast support for the efforts to safeguard and promote these fundamental democratic values, rights and freedoms. Honourable Members, this Parliament is unique in what it can offer those in search of democracy. You are the representatives of democracy: you demonstrate the power of the citizen, and the qualities of open debate and freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you know only too well the challenges of building democracy, fighting for causes and working for people. You have much to offer the people that I have met all over the region who long for greater dialogue and for the opportunity to meet with as many of you as they can. In this way, they can find out some of the practical ways in which democracy has taken root in your countries and in this European Union, and how you have overcome the challenges. I know that you will be generous in your support for those who are finding their own path to democracy and their own future.</p>
      <p sl="en">As it was put to me in Benghazi by one of the many young people I met, a young man who had been imprisoned by Gaddafi for eight years as a political prisoner: ‘we want what you have: democracy as everyday life’.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, they say that when the celebrated thinker, Ortega y Gasset, was asked what distance one needed to be from events in order to write history, he said, far enough not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatra’s nose.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lady Ashton, I bring this anecdote up not because Egypt is a country affected by the Arab Spring but rather because in the EU, we are experiencing an historic dilemma involving a lack of confidence in our project, debt crisis, the calling into question of the basic achievements that are most valued by our citizens, such as the Schengen area, and doubts over the ability of NATO.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, over the last two and a half years, we have experienced tangible progress in the form of your own duties as Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the birth of the European External Action Service and the Joint Communication on a renewed European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">You said yesterday that our neighbours will always be there and I share that view. The question is about us, whether we will rise to the occasion, whether we will live up to the expectations of our citizens, who regard foreign policy as a barometer for the state of the EU, whether we will be able to accompany these transition processes effectively in the countries that are the subject of the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lady Ashton, we are clearly backing that. We believe and hope that you will succeed in your work, but in order to do so, you must act with the highest profile. Not a physical profile, like in Ortega’s response, but rather a political profile, with particular emphasis on finding the greatest common denominator and not the lowest common multiple.</p>

    <intervention id="3-381-000" speaker_id="22097" name="Véronique De Keyser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have worked extremely hard, and you have our full support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Parliament’s resolution today relates to countries that are somewhat forgotten: Syria, Bahrain and Yemen. By calling for this specific focus, we are addressing a dual objective: the first is to break the silence and avoid practising double standards in the region, while these countries undergo cruel repression. The second is, while remaining firm in our condemnation of the atrocities that are being committed in these countries, to make political room for possible negotiations, which is something that you are going to look into.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This resolution has very wide support among the political groups, and I will simply make two or three points. The first, which may seem a little trifling, is of a linguistic nature. I do not like the idea of the expression ‘Arab world’ in the title of the report. This has somewhat post-colonial connotations, as if there were actually a single Arab world. As the resolution illustrates, and as you say yourself, there are many different countries, each with its own separate identity. There are also different regions, such as the Maghreb or the Mashreq region; therefore, I think we need to forget about this concept of an Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns Syria. The repression that is rife today in these countries is bitter, cruel and ruthless. Even children are not being spared. The resolution denounces these crimes, which cannot continue to go unpunished. It expresses concern over the waves of refugees now crossing the border from Syria into Turkey. It calls for humanitarian corridors and the intervention of the United Nations, and supports the emerging opposition both outside and inside the country. However, the resolution stops there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why? Why have we not gone further? Why did we not say, for example, that we want Bashar al-Assad to leave power, as he has disappointed all those who believed he would change the repressive system he inherited from his father? This president seems to have crossed a line from which there is no going back. It is because we wanted to leave room for political negotiations in the corridors of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, Syria is heading into a state of violence. Religious minorities, especially Christians, feel threatened today by extremists. Please visit Damascus as soon as you can. Unlike my fellow Member, I would ask you not to keep your distance. What we need is strong political action and a high-level European presence on the ground. There may still be an opportunity, and I call upon you to seize it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third point is more general. I am going to go over my time, but I wanted to say that we support the External Action Service, and our relationship with it is much improved. However, there are overlaps at the moment between the structures surrounding the High Representative, and other bodies such as the task force, which has yet to prove its worth. Our help for these countries is a test for us, today, and naturally, I hope that these structures and the External Action Service will succeed with flying colours in the task before them. Our credibility depends on it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to ask Baroness Ashton whether she has seen the shocking images on YouTube in the past two days that show a man in Syria filming demonstrations in a street full of homes. At one moment, he sees a sniper from the presidential militia and is killed by this very same man, live, as he is filming. That is what you see on YouTube: his own death.</p>
      <p sl="de">That man – and there are many cases like that – was killed because he was trying to make one thing clear: he was taking these pictures to put them on the Internet. He wanted everybody outside Syria to see what is happening in Syria, what continues to happen: a massacre of citizens with more than 1 500 deaths for the moment. In the outside world – let us be honest – we are watching and doing nothing, or almost nothing, to prevent it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I know Syria is not Libya, so there is no front line to defend. What is happening there is completely different from what is happening in Libya. In that sense, Libya is maybe more difficult to tackle, but that does not mean we cannot do more than we are currently doing. We are waiting for a UN Security Council resolution, and that has been the case now for weeks and weeks. We are hoping for a breakthrough with Brazil, with Russia and with China on this issue, and it has not been forthcoming.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we see, on the one hand, dramatic scenes taking place on the ground, live, and, on the other hand, Brazil, China and Russia blocking the Security Council, we have to imagine another way and ask further questions. We have to do more on our side and not wait for a Security Council resolution which will not come in the next few days or even weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a proposal. I think two things can be done in addition to what we have discussed up to now. First of all, we can extend the list of the people covered under sanctions. There is currently a list of 30 people, which has had to meet with the approval of the international community, or at least of the US and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to extend sanctions to all the 200 families who are currently in power in Syria, and who still support Assad by earning money thanks to the regime. It is thanks to these 200 families that Assad is still there. It is thanks to these 200 families that the massacre is still going on, and it is thanks to these 200 families that – as we can see on the Internet – snipers are killing innocent people on the streets.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can do more than waiting; waiting for weeks and weeks for a resolution that is not forthcoming in the Security Council. What we can do is target these people and extend the travel ban and asset freezing to these 200 families, who are very well known, and extend the list of 30. That is the first thing to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a second proposal: we should finally face up to reality. There is no front line to defend, so we cannot do the same thing as in Libya, but we should at least consider the possibility of creating a safe zone, what we call a ‘demilitarised zone’, on Syrian territory.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not wishful thinking, because it is currently under consideration in Ankara. This has already been done, in 1991 in Iraq – with the support of the US, you will remember – to protect the people living in the north of the country.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is what we should do; otherwise, we will continue to see what is happening now: more killings. We should do this as fast as possible. My proposal is: please stop waiting for unanimity – which will not come in the UN – and take the lead on these two additional initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, six months after the start of the Arab Spring, the countries in the Middle East and North Africa remain in flux.</p>
      <p sl="en">Egypt deserves credit for prosecuting former President Mubarak and his family for corruption. Its military has generally shown wisdom and restraint in its handling of the political vacuum in the country. The ECR hopes to see a new president emerge in September who can restore Egypt’s rightful place as leader of the Arab world. By the way, Ms De Keyser, there is an Arab world, there is also an Arab League, and that is the face for the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the elections, I hope that the Muslim Brotherhood will stick to their pledge to honour the concept of democratic pluralism and that Egypt will maintain the peace accords with Israel. These are vital for regional security. Egypt needs massive EU direct aid and loan finance now from the EIB and EBRD. I welcome Baroness Ashton’s initiatives in this area; we must help stabilise this key country’s economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tunisia is also beginning to make tangible progress towards a more stable future, but remains destabilised by the ongoing upheavals in neighbouring Libya. It is essential for the credibility of the EU and for NATO – which is enforcing the UN Security Council Resolution 1973 – to end Gaddafi’s grip on power in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having invaded Iraq in the name of banishing tyranny and championing democracy, we in the West can hardly leave the job half done in Libya; a wounded Gaddafi being allowed to stay in power would be a disaster as he would plot revenge against his own people and also Western targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I also call on Algeria to cease helping the Tripoli regime with supplies and free passage for mercenaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Yemen, the uncertainty about the succession to President Ali Abdullah Saleh risks emboldening the al-Qaeda terrorists in the country. He is now part of the problem and not the solution and he should stay in Saudi Arabia and sign the GCC-brokered agreement and pave the way for free elections and a successor.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Bahrain is also worrying, and I hope that the Sunni monarchy makes reformist concessions towards the opposition, mainly from the Bahraini Shia majority.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Syria, President Bashar seeks to brutally crush all resistance to his autocratic Ba’athist rule. We cannot forget the principled stand by courageous unarmed protesters calling for a democratic post-Bashar Syria free of the malevolent influence of Iran and its support for Hezbollah and Hamas. The arrest and torture of children is particularly sickening in Syria and, although I, too, am concerned by reports of Salafist jihadi groups now joining the protesters, this cannot be used by the regime as an excuse to murder innocent protesters. I particularly fear now for the Christians and the Iraqi refugees on that territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the constitutional reforms in Morocco to diminish the King’s powers, but hope the situation in Western Sahara can also be settled peacefully with the referendum for independence.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this week the independence of South Sudan, and hope that Khartoum, also a member of the Arab League, will not try to destabilise Africa’s newest nation, which needs all the help it can get from the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I thank the High Representative and her staff for all their good work and commitment to supporting the Arab Spring and stabilising the EU southern neighbourhood.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, all these populations are putting a colossal amount of energy into overthrowing regimes that are enemies of freedom and are oppressing them. We cannot help but admire this energy, and it puts paid to the prejudices held in various quarters about the supposed backwardness of the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has already been said, it requires a good deal of the European Union to rise to the challenge of these aspirations. For us to condemn the violence, support those who promote change, impose sanctions on the dictators, start again from scratch the deals we had negotiated with fallen powers, take on board the human, political and economic consequences of the upheaval that is going on, prevent counter-revolutionary attempts, mitigate the causes of destabilisation and rebuild our relationship as one of partnership, is a revolution in itself for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who now seriously believes that Bashar al-Assad is capable of beginning a political process that would involve those who promote democracy and change, and would establish the rule of law? I certainly do not, and I do not think many people do. And yet, there is no appeal to President al-Assad to leave power in our resolution. Nor is there a majority, unless we see proof to the contrary, willing to call the atrocities committed by this regime against peaceful citizens crimes against humanity, which is what they are, and to bring a case before the International Criminal Court through a Security Council resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not think we have exhausted all the possibilities for diplomacy. Turkey could provide valuable help on this, if it can persuade the hesitant countries that have been mentioned, especially Russia and Brazil, but also China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taking responsibility also means protecting. It means resettling refugees, activating temporary protection, rescuing people at sea. These are the concrete steps that the European Union should be proposing for refugees, instead of organising top-level crisis meetings to discuss EU law. If the EU wants to be consistent, it needs a system that will allow civil society to be involved at every stage in defining objectives and indicators and in implementing and evaluating the EU’s agreements with its future partners. This will represent real change for the European Union. Our partners are now accountable to their people, and their people are eagerly expressing their democratic demands.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, you were correct in your intuition and your analysis, well before the revolutions began. At the beginning of your mandate, you said that the validity of the EU’s external policy would be tested in its own neighbourhood. How true that is! If the Union rises to the challenge of these peoples’ democratic aspirations, its role on the new world scene will no longer hang as a question mark over the suffering that is piling up. In the situation as it stands today, it is the status of the European Union in this 21st century world taking shape before our eyes that is at stake.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Lady Ashton, I shall start by saying that it is obvious we need to continue supporting the democratic revolutions taking place in these countries. I do not have much time, so I only want to make a few observations. First and foremost, we cannot forget that the conditions for negotiating must be set by the peoples of these countries if we want a democratic transition and not civil war.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The situation in Syria is serious, and that is true for Syria, but also for Yemen and Bahrain. If we want to prevent civil war, the last thing these countries need is Europe interfering in their internal affairs, above all else, by presenting military or paramilitary solutions. If I say this, it is because we must totally reject what is happening in Libya. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the United Nations (UN) have exceeded all resolutions, even those voted for by the UN Security Council. It is this silence in relation to Libya, and this rejection that we should be making and that is absent from this resolution, that I cannot support.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the early 1950s, the founding father of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, hoped that regime change in Egypt would pave the way for peace with the Arab world. He even stuck his neck out for this idea in public, although it turned out to be in vain. The Nasser regime and other new military rulers in the region turned out to actually be more anti-Israel than the monarchs they had replaced.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Baroness Ashton, Israeli politicians and analysts fear that the current ‘Arabellion’ (another, more accurate term for the Arab Spring) will come to an end in the ‘gift of the Nile’, in a historical parallel to the 1950s. The political influence of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood will strongly boost their influential Palestinian allies and block any peaceful reconciliation with the Jewish State. High Representative, do you view the change of regime in Egypt, by any chance, as a positive change for Arab-Israeli relations? I ask this because not only the Muslim Brotherhood, but also secular figureheads such as ElBaradei and Amr Moussa fill Israeli observers with little confidence for future relations between Cairo and Jerusalem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Meanwhile, the real winner of this partial ‘Arabellion’ threatens to be the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is a real spectre, above all for the region, but potentially also for the world as a whole. Baroness Ashton, how can Europe, together with the United States, still prevent this scenario from coming about?</p>

    <intervention id="3-387-000" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, many Arab countries will not be able to return to the old days, but in most cases, it is not clear where their journey is leading. However, the people of Yemen, for example, give cause for hope, with groups which have never spoken to one another before sitting the situation out side by side.</p>
      <p sl="de">Simply replacing the president, as proposed by the Gulf Cooperation Council agreement, would not really bring about changes in the system. The situation in Egypt, where there are increasing numbers of attacks on Christians, shows that a coup by no means guarantees the introduction of democracy or religious freedom for minorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following the euphoria of the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia, it is clear that disillusionment has set in, given the ongoing security problems, the economic difficulties and the tough rearguard action being fought by the old regime. With the exception of Morocco, where the king is clearly popular, the protests in other Arab countries have simply led to empty promises and violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, we should not underestimate the strategic importance of Syria. If the Iranian bloc were to be responsible for slowing down the Arab Spring, this would send out a devastating signal. Perhaps, at long last, it is time for the West to call for the departure of President Assad and to withdraw its diplomats.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must also not ignore the risk of new influxes of refugees, even if there is radical democratic change in the Arab world. We must begin making preparations now, so that we are genuinely ready for the problems that will face us in future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is unacceptable that there is no reaction by the Security Council to the developments in Syria. International humanitarian law transcends the narrow notion of non-interference in the internal affairs of states and the danger to peace and security cannot concern only states, but also the security of individuals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia and China must be convinced to lift their opposition and allow the Security Council to condemn in the first instance the use of lethal force perpetrated against civilians, who must enjoy freedom of assembly, expression and peaceful demonstration.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Yemen, the GCC plan must be put into effect now, taking into account that Ali Abdullah Saleh is out of the country for reasons of health and must be discouraged by Saudi Arabia from returning, for the same reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Bahrain, the national dialogue and the commission of inquiry appointed to investigate the events must also answer the question of why the Shia majority is living in conditions of poor housing and in poverty within a rich country. Because this is what it is all about.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Libya, I support France for providing weapons to unarmed civilians in danger of massacre by the Gaddafi forces, in conformity with Resolution 1973. Even a landing of special forces for a 24-hour clean-up operation and then withdrawal – let us say in Zliten or Al Zawiya – is not an occupation force and is within the remit of Resolution 1973. Gaddafi’s departure must be hastened.</p>

    <intervention id="3-395-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle very much for their strong commitment to our neighbouring countries. Of course, there are still some unanswered questions. As far as Libya is concerned, I would like to know when we will find a solution. A purely military approach will not work. We must try at the same time to find a political solution, not to replace the military solution, but to run in parallel with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of Syria, I naturally share the general anger about the situation and I am very much in favour of us extending our sanctions, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and as the resolution also states. The question is: Is there still the chance of a Security Council resolution or not? What are the requirements for coming to a consensus with Russia on this issue? All the other options simply show once again how important it is for the European Union to have a good relationship with Turkey. Particularly with regard to the situation in this region, this relationship is highly significant and gives the lie to all those people who say that we do not need Turkey as our partner in this area, and I am not talking about membership here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Baroness Ashton, can we manage the situation in this region in the longer term without a special representative at ministerial level? You have appointed representatives and that is absolutely the right thing to do. However, there are people available to give you support, for example, Mr Moratinos and others. The two of you are working extremely hard, but this is not the only region that you have to deal with. Mr Füle is also responsible for a region in the East in particular. I wonder whether we need a stronger political presence in the region, and I would like to emphasise the word ‘political’ here, which would allow us to make it clear to the people there that the European Union wants to help them. I would like to ask you to consider this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The last point that I would like to make is that we are sending out different signals and I hope that most of them are positive. You are in the region, you are there on the ground, and the European Parliament is making a constant commitment to solidarity. However, in this situation, one of the largest Member States of the European Union is considering supplying tanks to the region, even if it is ‘only’ to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has a sinister regime and it has occupied one of its neighbouring countries. It is not a supporter of progress in the region.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I think it is a scandal that Germany is prepared to supply Saudi Arabia with tanks. I believe that we must speak out clearly against arms being supplied to the region at this point.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East and what we call – for lack of a better word – the Arab world in general, is such that one does not know where to begin.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course the situation in Syria is the most worrisome and provokes the most indignation – and rightly so. Also worrisome is what appears increasingly to be a stalemate in Libya. I am afraid that in both situations, a strictly military solution is probably not possible. If that is so, then we need to find a political, diplomatic solution, however unpalatable that might be inasmuch as it means, either directly or indirectly, entering into conversation and negotiation with leaders whom we despise and rightly want to see condemned for treating their own people in the most horrible way. I am afraid we need to face the fact that there might be no other solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the conflict between Palestine and Israel, it is clear to us that progress here could be extremely important, both to spare us the torment of having to take positions in the UN General Assembly next September, and also in terms of advancing towards a peaceful solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to welcome the glimmers of hope offered by recent events in Morocco, Jordan and – to a slightly lesser degree – Algeria, as well as the developments in Tunisia and Egypt. Let me conclude by calling upon the Member States to please respond to these positive developments with a ‘yes’ to increased financial assistance to the countries concerned.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we must undoubtedly do everything we can to ensure that democracy is maintained and developed in the Middle East, but democracy does not consist merely of electoral procedures. Genuine observance of rights is also necessary, such as the internationally recognised rights of minorities, including the rights of religious minorities. Unfortunately, the reality of the situation in Egypt and Iraq means that progress towards democracy is not synonymous with respect for the religious freedom of the Christian communities which have lived there for hundreds of years. The Copts in Egypt today feel under threat of violence from Islamic radicals and legal discrimination, the embodiment of which is the Sharia as the source of constitutional law. Christian Assyrians in Iraq have, for many years, been driven out of the country in the name of religious cleansing for very similar underlying reasons. We cannot remain silent on this matter. This is not about causing problems for democracy in the Middle East, or standing in its way. This is about laying the foundations for a genuinely democratic order in the region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would ask Baroness Ashton never to forget the situation of Christians in these countries. Democracy cannot mean they suffer even more discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle. It is a pleasure to have you both here with us. Baroness Ashton, I thank you for your commitment to the region and its democratic transformation. The people expect our genuine support, especially after years of European hypocrisy and collaboration with the regimes. I have three points I would like to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, about the structures you have set up. You have, with the Member States, appointed a Special Representative for the region. I think it is good but it comes a bit late. As Mr Swoboda said, in appointing Mr Leon, you have certainly picked a very experienced and knowledgeable man. However, he is not a public political figure and not somebody who has the weight to actually go there and lead the negotiations and have the continuous support we would like to see. You have set up a task force for the region which is chaired at director level. My question is: how will you articulate the task force and its director, the Special Representative and the External Action Service team you have together with Mr Füle and Mr Mingarelli sitting behind you? How will they articulate together? Will there be extra staff for example for the Special Representative?</p>
      <p sl="en">My second question is on Egypt. I think it is important to continue criticising ongoing human rights violations in Egypt; it is not as if everything is going perfectly well there. I have two questions there for you on the housing project you have financed and I ask you: if you implement this, will you ensure that the local community is involved in the planning? And secondly, will you finance civil society monitoring of the project afterwards? The EIB cannot finance this. It needs to be financed by the other instruments that we have.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Mr Swoboda has referred to the tanks supplied by Germany to Saudi Arabia. We have a new code of conduct and, as I understand it, the exports which Germany is currently planning are not in line with the new code. Have you checked this? Have you investigated whether it is possible? What is your opinion on this? Perhaps you could say something on this subject. I believe that it is not beneficial for the region for us to send out these signals now and provide this support for Saudi Arabia.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, what is happening today in the Arab world has already left its historic mark as the nations in the region move towards freedom and democracy. These people threw off the colonial yoke 50 or 60 years ago, but their anti-colonial uprising resulted, unfortunately, in the establishment of military and obscurantist regimes.</p>
      <p sl="el">At some point, what happened in Iran also created the impression that all nations in the area were turning towards Islam. However, the Arab Spring came and reversed that impression. The aim of the spontaneous and ideologically unaligned uprisings in the Arab countries is to establish democratic, secular regimes.</p>
      <p sl="el">Civil society has taken its fate into its hands and is calling for support from the international community in order to complete the reversal with peaceful means, not military intervention, as in Libya. It is within this framework of peaceful popular action that the Palestinian people have taken recourse to the United Nations, calling for the state of Palestine to be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="el">As the European Union, we need to demonstrate solidarity with the rebelling nations of North Africa and Palestine.</p>

    <intervention id="3-401-000" speaker_id="99416" name="Nikolaos Salavrakos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, it would appear that the democratisation processes in the Mediterranean part of Africa were set in motion satisfactorily, with the exception, of course, of Libya. I personally feared the extent of the demonstrations in the Middle East, which is a boiler ready to explode and, at the same time, the epicentre of numerous terrorist organisations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Since March of this year, Syria has been at the mercy of anti-government demonstrations. It has closed its borders to International Amnesty organisations, as well as international resources and international observers, and the whole scenario is raising questions as to whether the Assad regime will be the next regime to be overturned during the course of the so-called Arab Spring.</p>
      <p sl="el">You need to keep a very careful eye on Syria, Baroness Ashton. Syria is of particular geopolitical importance because it lies in the extension of Iran towards the Mediterranean and, at the same time, it borders Turkey, while its friendships in the region, regardless of whether they are overturned or change for the better or the worse, will perhaps bring about certain reversals in the geopolitical situation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="el">Careful attention must, of course, be paid to the geopolitical importance of Syria and I would ask you to take all the measures needed to stabilise the role and the influence of the European Union as a global partner. Unfortunately, I see slow reactions on the part of the Security Council. I should also like to emphasise the need for you to pay close attention to Greece, because it may be going through a rough patch, but its geopolitical role and the balance it brings to the Middle East are of vital importance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the so-called Arab Spring filled many of us with hope and we are pleased to see the fall of some of these disgraceful regimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, democracy is not coming to all Arab nations just yet, with the situation in the Lebanon being particularly worrying. Hezbollah, officially categorised as a terrorist organisation, is now controlling the Lebanese Government. Every city in Israel is now within range of Hezbollah rockets stationed in Lebanon. There are believed to be 15 000 such rockets. A UN tribunal has recently issued indictments charging four individuals, reported to be members of Hezbollah, with the murder of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and 22 others in 2005. Hezbollah provides military training to Hamas, another terrorist group and one that has been blacklisted by the EU since 2003. Hezbollah is supported by Syria and Iran. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard funds Hezbollah to the tune of USD 0.5 billion per year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ashton, this is my question. Given that Lebanon is also a major recipient of EU funding, currently receiving over EUR 200 million per year, could you please explain to me the type of relationship that you envisage between the EU External Action Service and the Hezbollah-led government of the Lebanon?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as Chair of the Delegation for Relations with the Mashreq Countries, I should like to say a few words about each of ‘my’ – in inverted commas, obviously – four countries. Starting with Syria, and reiterating what some fellow Members have already said, it is regrettable that the international community seems, to the public, to be applying double standards. There is a need to denounce, where appropriate, the countries that I am referring to, which have prevented the international community from adopting a position in the United Nations (UN) Security Council more in line with what should be our shared values: I am referring, obviously, to Russia and China, with their veto, as well as to Brazil.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards Egypt, I believe there is a pressing need to persuade the Egyptian authorities to postpone the elections, as has already been done in Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards Lebanon, I believe a very clear message for the new Lebanese Government needs to come out of this debate: it needs to be aware that it will be judged on what action it takes regarding the accusations drafted by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regarding Jordan, it is the proof that a peaceful transition is possible. It is, perhaps, only necessary at this stage to persuade and encourage the authorities to speed up the reform process.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In a debate like this, we obviously cannot forget the Middle East peace process: as well as reiterating our hope that next Monday’s meeting of the Quartet will actually be productive, we would reaffirm that this House should certainly like to see much greater European Union involvement in the process as a whole. I have no doubt there will be a new round of negotiations before the UN General Assembly in September, but I hope that this round of negotiations will be productive and undertaken in good faith.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is true that what is happening in other countries, like Tunisia and Morocco, shows that the route to democracy is viable; it may follow a different path, but it is possible. This observation, however, does not dispel the public perception of the policies pursued by the international community and by Europe itself on these events involving the Mediterranean region.</p>
      <p sl="it">This perception questions the idea that foreign policy can apply double standards as it unfolds. In essence, we wonder why things are done one way in Libya and another way in Syria. Certainly, it is clear that different standards apply in foreign policy: from political realism, to the strategic nature of certain areas, to the reluctance of large countries to adopt more definite positions.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, this is a contradiction that continues to dog us and which we must be able to tackle. How? In two ways: there is a need for European policy to take more of a leading role, for greater consistency to give credibility to our presence throughout this area; there is a need to give political weight to the idea of a Euro-Mediterranean operating structure that can provide a genuine and lasting reference point for both the north and south sides and that can deal with existing problems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have mentioned that you will be holding Quartet negotiations on 11 September and I am very pleased about that. I am equally pleased, although perhaps also a little surprised, because you are setting your sights very high. You have already clearly stated that you expect this meeting to result in a statement that will bring the Palestinians and the Israelis back to the negotiating table. You have publicly set yourself a very challenging objective and I very much hope that you achieve it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why am I hoping for this? On the one hand, for the sake of the people in the region and, on the other, because I am concerned once more about the common foreign and security policy. Mr Sarkozy has announced that he will behave in a certain way and the German Government has said that it will do something quite different. If we then find ourselves in a situation where the Palestinians present their concerns to the General Assembly, I am again worried about the unity of the Member States on a central foreign policy question and it is you who will bear the brunt of the criticism. Therefore, I wish you every success in these Quartet negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that you have said that democracy is important and that the people in the region want democracy. That is certainly true. However, I believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that what the people really want is dignity and we should focus all our attention on this issue. They want to be able to live in dignity under the rule of law, with no arbitrary confiscation of property. They want habeas corpus and they want to be free from constant threats by the secret police. They want jobs and the prospect of a positive future, so that a free trade agreement with us really will bring results. Of course, they also want democracy and the option of shaping their own political system. However, that is one part of a bigger picture. Finally, they also want peace and an end to this terrible violence.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my thanks, Baroness Ashton, for your presence here today. It is important that, when we discuss North Africa, we do not overlook the situation in South Sudan. For this new nation, the glorious date of Saturday, 9 July 2011, approaches. South Sudan will finally become independent. We hope and pray that an end is brought to this long period of war and oppression. That independence is just a first step on a very long road, as the difficulties for this new nation are not a thing of the past – quite the contrary, in fact.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important that the European Union should give this new state comprehensive support. I am thinking, in particular, of the areas of education and agriculture, which are areas that must be given top priority. This will enable the country to be self-sufficient in time. The European Union has a great deal of expertise to share in these particular areas, and we must therefore help this new nation along the road through assistance in these fields.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is more to do, however. Omar al-Bashir must be stopped. He is currently committing a massacre in the Abyei region. He has begun ethnically cleansing the Dinka Ngok people. A stop must be put to this. My question to you is: what are you doing about this, indeed, what can you do about this? Baroness Ashton, you know you have our support for your human rights policy, but I also call on you to support the people of South Sudan.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to address those German Members of this House who apparently cannot cope with the criticism expressed by other Members of the plan by the German Government to supply tanks to Saudi Arabia. As Members of the European Parliament, they should be familiar with the EU code of conduct on arms exports and should be committed to ensuring that it is complied with.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having said that, Foreign Minister Ashton and Commissioner Füle, I would like to thank you for your commitment and the support that you, with the External Action Service and the Commission, are giving to the transformation processes in Northern Africa and the Middle East. I would like to refer especially to the money that the European Union is giving to this area and especially with regard to the situation of poverty, not just of refugees, but of people who are still suffering from poverty in the region. We have to do something for them.</p>
      <p sl="de">As to the additional EUR 1.2 billion that was promised in ENP (European Neighbourhood Policy) funds, we found out that only EUR 238 million is actually additional funds to be shared between the southern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. Is that really enough for Europe to make a difference? If it is not, then please correct me and put the numbers right.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other thing is that you support programmes for the region, known as ‘national indicative programmes’. It is our understanding – half a year after the Arab Spring – that they are still the old ones, the pre-revolution ones. They have not been updated.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, it is not the first time that we have discussed the Arab countries and the upheavals there. While we are debating the developments that have taken place from Syria to Morocco, in my opinion, Parliament is also reappraising its own past, in other words, the cooperation that was at least tolerated between the European Union and countries which we rightly refer to today as having autocratic regimes and whose internal structures we are concerned about. This is a good thing. However, I cannot help but get the impression that we have once again started to relax in the supposed certainty that everything is under control and everything will be all right.</p>
      <p sl="de">The thing which I personally find impossible to deal with is that we are continuing to comment on political processes, but we are still not prepared to put these developments in their national and regional social context and to investigate the causes of these changes. We must finally stop applying double standards in our foreign policy and also in our democratic dealings with one another. We should talk about the interrelationships between EU Neighbourhood Policy and EU policy on the failure to resolve the Palestinian conflict. I very much welcome your commitment to the Quartet.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should discuss the fact that the war against Colonel Gaddafi’s autocratic regime, which some EU Member States and NATO are involved in, is already having dramatic economic consequences in Tunisia. The outflow of capital, Tunisians returning home to look for work, migrants, a collapse in the country’s income from tourism and in its trade relationships are just some of the issues. This war is also playing into the hands of the powers in the military and the political elite in Egypt who want to return to the previous regime. We are now dealing not just with new problems and no longer only with old problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, we need a fundamental political and economic reorientation of the European Union’s foreign policy activities. I believe that this has become clear during the course of this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am concerned that we might be drawn into yet more conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East. Our involvement in Libya was ostensibly to oppose repression and promote democracy, but, of course, Gaddafi was already unpopular with the West for his policy of the gold dinar for trading oil.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bashar al-Assad, who initially showed great promise, has shown himself to be as violent and repressive as Gaddafi. However, neither Gaddafi nor al-Assad are militant Islamists. It would be a great disaster if they were to be replaced by Islamists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Yemen is the country to which al-Qaeda has allegedly moved its training operations. I hope that we will not be tempted to engage in another bloody conflict there. We must not see British and other European soldiers lured into so-called peacemaking operations in Syria or anywhere else in the region. Furthermore, we cannot assume that democracy will flourish in any of the infertile soils of the Arab countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, freedom and a better standard of living or, when you combine the two things, human dignity, are the decisive aspects of the Arab revolution and these two concepts were also characteristic of the movements in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989. In many respects, the requirements are different and this is why it is also difficult to bring about organised change and introduce a democratic system in these cases. I believe that we should focus our partnership and neighbourhood policy, the instruments and resources that we have, more closely on these two objectives and increase our multilateral approach to this issue, instead of concentrating only on the old bilateral relationships. We must support the process and ensure that in Egypt and Tunisia, for example, as Mr David has said, the timing is such that people there have the opportunity to develop a democratic system and to establish political parties. This is an important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must also be aware that the brutal regime in Syria is still a hiding place for minorities, because it has provided them with protection. If we look back at what happened to the Christians in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was toppled, it gives cause for concern that the same thing could now happen in Syria. We must take into consideration the position of Christian minorities, for example, when we are aiming to implement reforms and to abolish these brutal systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one final remark. I think that you need significant support for your ambitious objectives in the Quartet meeting next week. I do not believe that we should take up a position in favour of or against the unilateral recognition of the Palestinian state. We must make it our policy to avoid this question and to ensure that negotiations take place between the Palestinians and the Israelis as quickly as possible so that we can put in place a sensible, lasting policy. If you can bring this about, it will be a magnificent achievement. I believe that this is in the interests of the Palestinians, the Israelis and also the members of the Quartet, because I understand that the intention is for the EU to play a stronger political role in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the developments of the Arab Spring must be seen in this context. Similarly, on the other hand, the negative example of Iran and the need for security, which also involves Israel, must not be disregarded. This may seem to contradict everything that I have already said. However, the countries in the region that act as a counterpart to Iran and have given up a great deal in order to prevent Iran gaining possession of the atomic bomb deserve our support, whether or not we like their regimes, to ensure that Iran does not become the dominant power in the region. In order to achieve this, we must provide the neighbouring countries with the necessary security options. This can also be seen as a response to Mrs Brantner.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, many thanks for your introduction and the efforts that you have made. Clearly, the situation varies greatly from country to country and what has been causing us more and more concern over recent days and weeks is the situation in Syria. We see shocking images, over a thousand people have died, many people have been hounded and locked up, there are tens of thousands of refugees and it just does not stop, despite the pressure that has been gradually applied, including the sanctions that you have announced. Yet that appears to have absolutely no impact, or at least far too insignificant an impact. Of course, I agree with the logic that, with a UN resolution lacking, the options remain limited for the time being, that a political dialogue, which now needs to get under way very quickly, remains the best solution, but it must be more than mere words. We have already heard numerous announcements in this regard from Damascus, but these need to be followed up by action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What, then, are our short-term options? We need to tighten up and extend the sanctions regime, although the effects of so doing should not be overestimated. These people, after all, are fighting literally and figuratively for their political survival and we must remember that desperate people will do whatever it takes. We still need to do this, however.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the European Union needs to develop a strategy capable of reassuring the minorities that evidently continue to support the regime. It must be made clear that there is no future with this regime, that dialogue and change are necessary, and that their security can be guaranteed in a new context.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, the longer the situation endures, the more victims there will be, but also the more the country will be squeezed economically and financially. That will lead to new problems, weaken the regime and perhaps make it show some lenience. We need to keep a very close eye on this situation and be able to react quickly and alertly to new developments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to endorse what has been said by all those who emphasised the role that Turkey can and must play in resolving the situation in Syria, and I would like to ask you, Baroness Ashton, to consult with Turkey in a very close and coordinated manner.</p>

It is just as important to create jobs and training placements for Africans, and the rules on fair and equitable trade are extremely important here. I would encourage attempts to establish fairer rules and, furthermore, efforts to motivate these countries to engage in closer cooperation among themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission wants to increase the support that we give to our southern partners by more than EUR 1 billion over the period 2011-2013. I would ask you, Baroness Ashton, what the financial instruments in the EU budget are, within whose framework the EU intends to channel this money, and what this money is supposed to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am pleased that, in its resolution, Parliament recognises Turkey’s important role as an intermediary and peace-builder in the Arab world. Turkey has acted in an exemplary fashion, not least because it has kept its border open to Syrian refugees. Coordination efforts with Turkey should be stepped up, especially with respect to matters of foreign policy, and relations cannot fully develop merely within the context of enlargement policy. Turkey must also be a strategic partner of the EU, not just a recipient country, and I think that the EU must be able to recognise Turkey’s important role here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a properly negotiated two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine question would be the greatest catalyst to democracy, economic progress and confidence in the Arab world. Instead, the proposed unilateral declaration of statehood at the UN General Assembly by the Palestine Authority takes us in the opposite direction. It can only create more tension and deepen hostility. Will the High Representative/Vice-President use EU leverage to dissuade the Palestine Authority from this course of action?</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, I congratulate the governments of Turkey, Greece and the Republic of Cyprus for their robust action in thwarting the second of the so-called ‘peace flotillas’, which was, of course, just a deliberate provocation to violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ashton has told us something of what the EU has been doing. I am not sure there is a lot to show for the EUR 4 billion being spent since 2007 on democracy and development in the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="en">In regard to Libya, the European Union has wasted a lot of time and money on its effort to foist an EU military mission on an unwilling international community. This mission never saw the light of day, but cost the taxpayer EUR 7 million nonetheless. All this is a distraction from the real effort. What a pity that more European NATO members have not contributed to the NATO Operation Unified Protector. I am sorry the Polish Presidency is not with us this afternoon. Why is Poland not contributing at least one of its three squadrons of F16 strike fighters to this NATO action?</p>

We have taken too long to respond – or, in some cases, not to respond – to these long-standing needs, in keeping with the values that we preach. First Algeria, then Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morocco, Jordan: the people of the southern Mediterranean are reminding us of a longing to be able to live according to the universal values of equality, freedom and brotherhood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) might be the project on which our new relationship could be based, around common values of solidarity and respect for the law.

It is time we put our words into action and stopped applying double standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, will you dare to take action that will allow the Palestinian state to exist within its 1967 borders and lift the blockade on Gaza? The time has come to do this if we do not want to lose credibility in the eyes of our southern neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, serious developments have erupted in North Africa and the Middle East which are linked to the intensity of the struggle by the working, grassroots forces for social and democratic rights and to efforts to modernise the bourgeois regime of the countries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, imperialist powers and the international unions which those powers have established and which they serve are involved in these developments. One of these is the European Union, which appears to be extremely worried by these developments and is making desperate efforts to impose a new, more unfair and more repressive framework on bilateral relations with these countries. The proof of this is the pogrom against immigrants, the continuing imperialist war by NATO and cold-blooded murder of civilians in Libya, the consignments of military equipment from France and preparations to send a EUFOR mission to Libya.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, the core issue in the region is still the hypocritical stand being taken by the United States and the European Union on the Palestinian state and the fact that Greece and Israel have been engaged in systematic military cooperation to the detriment of stability and peace in the region.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to condemn from this tribune the action taken by the Greek Government, which prohibited the peace convoy from setting sail for Gaza. This was a provocative and unacceptable action which undermines stability in the region and which has nothing in common with the feelings of the Greek people.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to call on all our Member States to recognise the state of Palestine at the UN General Assembly. It is time that the Palestinian nation gained its rights.

      <p sl="el">Secondly, how can Israel, which can indeed have a parliament, which can have political parties, which can have everything, be considered a democratic state, when it continues to illegally occupy foreign land? How can such occupation be considered legal when it has been condemned by the United States, by the United Nations in repeated resolutions, with repeated position statements, when it is now common ground that the existence of a Palestinian state must be recognised? Since when has the refusal to grant a state recognition, the recognition demanded by the international community, been a democratic right and example of the democracy of a country?</p>

We have a political and moral obligation to give these people our full support and to show our solidarity with them.

In this context, we also need a peace plan in the Middle East. We must not keep things as they are, so that the situation in the Middle East remains unchanged. We occasionally hear people saying that nothing must change, because the situation could become threatening. Freedom is never threatening.</p>

The problem, or rather the relationship, between Israel and Palestine has a significance that reaches far beyond the region itself, because it also touches on the question of how we coexist in a civilised world. If there is no peace between Israel and Palestine and if Palestine’s right to secure borders is not recognised, then this will always weigh heavily on our relations with the Arab and Muslim world. That is why everyone needs to know that relations between Israel and Palestine have a significance that reaches far beyond the relationship between these two groups.

      <p sl="en">In this debate, I ask for their response in three areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, do they agree with Amnesty International? The witness testimonies, videos and monitoring reports show systematic crimes of humanity in Syria – in excess of those recorded in Libya – and that therefore there should be no barrier to European countries seeking full referral of Syrian perpetrators to the International Criminal Court within the UN Security Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, will they accept that there should be full reference to international humanitarian law (IHL) following the May communication, and support for the EU guidelines on IHL in all of the follow-up actions in countries within the region? We seek to uphold the rule of law. There is no higher law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, I do not understand why, for the last recorded year, Europe exported over EUR 250 million of aircraft, military vehicles, small arms and light weapons to Libya, how the United Kingdom, until at least late last year, sold small arms, ammunition, body armour, assault rifles and tear gas to Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, and why Germany and Spain appear poised to sell battle tanks to Saudi Arabia. Do they really think this is consistent with the ban on selling weapons which could be used for internal repression? Should there not now be a freeze on all arms sales and security cooperation with all of the countries of North Africa and the Gulf, or is the Arab Spring really the spring for European machine guns, gunning down the democracy protesters that we say we support?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, all eyes are naturally on Syria today, but they are also on Libya, where the situation is difficult, whilst we urgently need to rush to the aid of Tunisia and Egypt. The Deauville G8 summit announced that it would mobilise USD 40 billion for the period 2011-2015, half of which would be for Tunisia and Egypt alone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, I would like to tell you that the time to help those two countries is now. It is now, before they hold their elections, that we must help them stabilise their economies and get their economies going again. There can be no democracy without development, and there can be no development without democracy. We urgently need to provide help, therefore, and to invest and stand alongside them. We also urgently need to equip ourselves with a more coherent partnership policy. We should re-examine our trade links with these countries and open our borders, for example, to products from Tunisia. This will also be a form of help and an opportunity to re-examine our immigration policy so that we create a European policy, instead of a policy that is merely the sum of selfish national policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Turning again to Syria: everyone has spoken about this, and yesterday Amnesty International said it considered the brutality of the repression to be on a par with crimes against humanity. I take this very seriously. Europe must clearly do more than it has done thus far. What we have done is good, but we need to reinforce sanctions. I think the silence of the international community is utterly to be condemned. Saying nothing is as good as handing out a licence to kill, and we cannot talk or negotiate with these countries without having first condemned what is going on in Syria at the moment.</p>

The clashes have lasted 16 weeks and claimed almost 1 500 lives, according to local humanitarian organisations. Twenty-eight people died during last week’s demonstration in Hama, which was the largest since March. Reports that the authorities have dismissed the town’s governor for trying to prevent the bloodshed are particularly shocking. The fact that refugees heading for Turkey are being prevented from escaping is also a violation of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The international community cannot sit back and watch these blatant violations of human rights by the Syrian regime. We should therefore step up our attempts to ensure that a UN resolution is adopted condemning the actions of Bashar al-Assad. He is losing his legitimate claim to power, and I therefore agree with the position of the British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, who has said that the Syrian leader must reform his regime or step aside. We should consider stepping up pressure by extending economic sanctions, and also level charges in cases where human rights have been violated.

When we intervened in the crisis in the Balkans, we waited too long, we hesitated too long, and the consequences were tragic.

Support for all democratic forces and their security needs to be guaranteed with more follow-up pressure. However, the people there must also have economic prospects.

This cannot be described as an active peace policy. Libya sends its best wishes, Mr Westerwelle. We must pull together to stop Iran. Leopard tanks will not stop nuclear weapons. That, too, needs to be stated clearly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, please use all your influence and all your powers to prevent this deal. There is a nice Latin saying: pecunia non olet – money does not stink, however, these billions of euro certainly do.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is that we are having difficulty bringing together all the possible instruments and making even small but tangible gestures.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have: political dialogue, trade policy, development coordination, immigration policies and humanitarian aid with separate managers, procedures and budget lines and sometimes Europe picks a card and uses the policy it likes the most, but we need to pursue every option to help whoever is most deserving and to update all the instruments.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, trade with Egypt and Tunisia cannot continue with the same agreements for other countries in the region. A Mediterranean development bank is needed or, alternatively, the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could be extended, just as the European Investment Bank can finance small enterprises in Moldova or in Ukraine, but not in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe reach the Caucasus and Central Asia, but there is no Mediterranean integration cooperation organisation. What initiatives do we intend to adopt in this direction? Is Parliament currently asking for a specific Erasmus programme for the Mediterranean and why is the Commission not rolling out this initiative immediately? An Arab employee of a multinational can obtain a visa for Europe, but a small Tunisian entrepreneur who wants to sign a contract cannot.</p>
      <p sl="it">High Representative, it is up to you not to waste any initiative and to consistently bring together all our actions from the many European Union bodies, otherwise, the change will take over and inspire the Mediterranean, but it will not have inspired us.</p>

Assassinations, suicide bombings and rocket attacks continue daily. Corruption is endemic, the citizens have limited access to drinking water, and electricity supplies are restricted to about six hours a day, while temperatures just now rise to above 50 °C. There are few jobs, and there is massive unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Erbil Agreement, which was supposed to create a government of national unity, has never been implemented.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Lady Ashton, I share your view that the EU must give its attention as a matter of priority to the southern Mediterranean, which is going through a period of extraordinary changes. I am delighted that the recent referendum in Morocco has adopted the reform promoted by King Mohammed VI. It would be good if changes at a constitutional level were accompanied by reforms in economic and social matters in order to reduce inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Contrary to what is happening in Morocco, we are receiving bad news from Syria and, unfortunately, the end of the Gaddafi regime has not yet been brought about in Libya. We must remain involved in these processes, and also in Egypt and Tunisia. It is very important that we go along with the changes that are taking place in the region and we must ensure that the values of liberty, justice, democracy and respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and religion and also gender equality, prevail. Positive conditionality or, what amounts to the same thing, the more for more strategy, should assist this as well as strengthen relations with civil society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I am concluding. I hope, moreover, that the Union for the Mediterranean is finally able to act after a period of paralysis. Furthermore, as of yesterday, it has a new Secretary General, whom I wish success in the complex management of the Union. Let us hope that projects identified some three years ago can be set in motion and so contribute to improving the economy in the Mediterranean countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am even wearing a flower-patterned shirt to symbolise the Arab Spring. Who could have expected, a few months ago, this wind of change energised by the universal values of democracy and which is now blowing on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and more widely on the Arab world? No one. Certainly not most European leaders who have been urging us for years to enter into agreements of all kinds with dictatorial regimes for the sake of Europe’s interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I say to myself that it is never too late to show courage and dignity – the courage to say to our people that there is no Muslim horde about to sweep across Europe, but that there is a young population who, paying with their blood, want to see democracy irreversibly established, and want Europe to be a partner who helps them, so that the rule of law is no longer an illusion but becomes a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tunisia and Egypt are currently in a situation of emergency. There is not enough time here for me to give an overview of the countries where there are uprisings. However, I do want to vigorously condemn with all my heart, here before you, the atrocities committed by the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, this condemnation is directed at all countries where the word ‘repression’ is opposed to the word ‘freedom’. In moments like these, even if history is sometimes cruel, the international community – of which you are one of the dignitaries, Madam – should react so as to show support to and solidarity with the peoples who have taken up the struggle, but also to condemn in the strongest possible way, and in all instances, all these contemptible regimes and all the countries that do not comply with international law or with United Nations resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In your communication of 25 May, you mentioned this support. I know that this is one of your priorities. However, I urge you, Baroness Ashton, even if this means devoting all your energy, to move from appeasing words to constructive solutions. I would not wish to see, as the only response to this Arab Spring which is changing the face of the world, a European winter where narrow-mindedness sets in, borders close and walls come up.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, the Syrian people no longer trust Bashar al-Assad. This revolution started – as has been widely acknowledged – as in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, in the name of dignity, freedom and democracy. Obviously, this has nothing to do with the fundamentalism that was so much talked about and feared.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These revolutions are clearly inspired by the notion of a secular state and by the thirst for freedom of a youth that wants to be in control of its own destiny. The pressure that we exert should therefore be effective. At present, it is merely rhetorical. To my mind, it is not effective enough. We need to go beyond virtual posturing. Baroness Ashton, I am aware of the limits of diplomacy; I know that it is difficult to set a common position for the 27, but I also know that you have the ability, if you are so inclined, to propose a slightly more radical measure for instance, that would entail asking the 27 Member States to send back the Syrian diplomats serving in Europe. What is more, this request has been formulated by the Syrian opposition. I believe this could send a strong signal, which, in my opinion, could perhaps be a little more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I would also like to ask you to pass on this request for an international independent investigation commission and finally – this has been aptly said by Mr Pöttering and by others, especially Mr Brok – I think that you cannot ignore the strong link in terms of opportunity that exists between what is happening in the Muslim and Arab world and what should be happening in the Middle East. I believe that we now have a chance to make progress in resolving the conflict in the Middle East in a decisive way, by putting pressure on both parties. I did not like the heated discussions by the spokespersons of each side.</p>

If we had asked experts on North Africa at the start of the year, they would have been able to tell us that the dictators in that part of the world could sleep peacefully. On paper, everything looked quite safe, with the army and the security services, everything under control. Yet a wave was started by one young person who quite simply set himself on fire as a sign of protest against the evil, which proved that those who said that the Arab world and our Muslim brothers were not mature enough for democracy and did not deserve democracy were wrong.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we are witnessing something incredible. Our Muslim brothers are dying for democracy, and they are giving up their lives to be free. I therefore think that it is our particular moral duty to help these people. I will not echo the criticisms of Baroness Ashton, since I believe that the European Union has done a great deal in view of the complex conditions in which it is working, although it is always possible to say that we could do more.

On the other hand, I want to talk about the bigger picture in today’s debate – the situation in the Arab world and North Africa – to emphasise the need to make a clear distinction between the different change processes taking place. In Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, violence has certainly been the main response, with all the necessary overtones, to the demands expressed by the general population for change and, at the very least, democracy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope, just as I believe that we all hope, that the authorities in these countries will understand that there is no option other than a process of genuine transition to democracy. Violence will not win the day.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, I would like to highlight, on the other hand, the example of Morocco which, in this respect, is extremely significant, proving that a peaceful transition to democracy is possible. In this respect, too, I welcome, as did my colleague, Mr Millán Mon, the result of last Friday’s referendum, in the hope that an extensive reform programme will be introduced and that, in contrast, the Moroccan parties will play a bigger role in modernising the country.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, China and Russia veto action on Syria on the UN Security Council, thereby encouraging the Assad regime to continue the massacre. Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other Member States sell arms to Saudi Arabia and turn a blind eye to the repression in Bahrain and Yemen. At least in Libya, the UN Security Council has lived up to its responsibilities, but – I regret to say – our Europe risks not being involved, despite your efforts, Lady Ashton and Commissioner Füle.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Instead of acting unilaterally or in a limited way under the umbrella of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), European Union Member States should have launched a common security and defence policy mission a long time ago, to help impose the arms embargo, control borders and, above all, protect civilians. If EUFOR Libya were operating jointly with NATO, perhaps the Libyan people would already have overcome the impasse threatening so many lives in Tripoli and other cities still controlled by the dictator, Colonel Gaddafi.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we asked in this resolution, the European Union should urgently make a part of the frozen funds available, so that the National Transitional Council can respond to the basic needs of the population under UN supervision. This could determine Libya’s future, Lady Ashton. In the post-Gaddafi period, Libyans and the international community will expect Europe to do everything it can to help equip the transitional government with democratic political power and civil society, and to support the electoral, constitutional, judicial, administrative and security reforms needed to build a democratic Libya.

      <p sl="es">I wish to acknowledge, therefore, the effort that you and your team have made and you also, Commissioner Füle, to adapt foreign policy to the new scenario, to support with determination and respect the changes in the Arab world, and I hope that the Member States will accompany you on this road.</p>

      <p sl="en">Eyewitness accounts and reports suggest that the abuse was widespread and systematic. In one refugee camp alone, humanitarian workers found over 250 women who would cautiously speak out about their ordeal.

Not only do these women have to deal with the trauma of abuse, but they are then compelled into silence for fear of shaming their families.</p>

The use of children as human shields, snipers that indiscriminately attack civilians and now the use of rape as a weapon of war are tactics of a true despot.

The city was besieged by the Assad regime’s tanks and armoured vehicles. That is just today, and just one city. The violence is also carrying on at full throttle in other locations throughout the country. The Syrian authorities have sealed the borders with Turkey and Lebanon. The villages close to the border are besieged. Thousands of refugees have crossed the border into Turkey and thousands more are waiting to do the same. As it stands, these people are trapped like rats. Turkey has promised to accept the refugees and it is up to the EU to offer this candidate State for membership of our Union all the help we can, and to do so quickly.

      <p sl="en">As democrats, we have an obligation to support the implementation of these rights for Palestinians, too. There is no contradiction between starting negotiations on final status issues while acknowledging these principles in practice for Palestine at the United Nations in September. The two things could, in fact, be mutually reinforcing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lady Ashton, I welcome your strenuous efforts to get negotiations back on track and I wish you success for your initiative with the Quartet on the Middle East next Monday. Gazans need more than humanitarian aid. They need a normal life, they need jobs and they need to be released from their open-air prison, and achieving these things would, I believe, ensure their support for a negotiated settlement. As regards Hamas, I urge the Quartet to listen carefully to the 24 former prime ministers, former ministers and peace negotiators – some of whom participated in the Northern Ireland process – who have urged it to consider the conditions it has applied to Hamas as goals rather than preconditions. They have advocated that, at least to start negotiations with Hamas, it should be sufficient that they adhere to a ceasefire and to the principle of non-violence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for the constitutional reforms in Morocco and Algeria, which are a peaceful demonstration of hope for the whole region but, unfortunately, are in sharp contrast to the recent bloodshed in Egypt, Syria and Yemen. At the same time, as a participant in the political process of democratisation in Bulgaria, I share the anxiety of opposition parties in Morocco and Algeria that the proposed reforms might fall short of bringing the much desired change. Allow me to borrow some wise words from Otto von Habsburg, who once said that the essence of a country lies in citizens’ freedoms and legal order. Systems of governing, whether monarchies or republics, are just solutions that abide by these principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Governance based on legality is the most acceptable system that suits human needs. Let us remember that the Arab Spring was at first inspired by the story of a Tunisian street vendor whose basic human right to dignity was violated in public.</p>
      <p sl="en">The democratisation experience of Eastern Europe shows that democracy is not a single act but a constant process that goes well beyond simply calling elections. Democracy cannot be imposed. Democracy needs to be fully yearned for and protected by the whole society. We need to stress, also, that democratic changes are irreversible only if they guarantee the economic prosperity of a critical mass of people. The under-developed private sector of each of these countries also undermines the educated and active population. The European role in the process is not just to inject money but especially to provide know-how.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU has shown clear support for all forms of uprising against all forms of undemocratic regimes, but our support has to be very tangible. All the people have to feel our assistance. Yes, the EU imposed restrictive measures on persons in Syria, but it did not go far enough. Our policy in Libya is crucial and effective, but we have to do more.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to mention only a few examples. We have to stop all supplies of military equipment to the undemocratic governments in the region. We have to change all instances where we use double standards. Of course, we have to be very careful not to support the forces and movements with Islamist ideology.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards cooperation with Turkey, Turkey has shown its really effective support for democratic changes in the region. We have to appreciate not only the humanitarian assistance for the Syrian refugees, but clear statements from Turkey against Mubarak, Gaddafi, and now against the hardliners in Syria. We have to involve Turkey more. The Palestinian-Israeli peace process is a conceivable part of the regional solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to have a united Europe in position. Calling for an urgent relaunch of negotiations is equally important so as to avoid a European split on the UN vote. I hope, Baroness Ashton, that you will be successful in this process.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, one day, when we are debating the situation in North Africa and Syria, as we are doing today, we will have to acknowledge that we have placed stability above democracy and have been satisfied for there simply to be stability in the countries in this region. We have been slow to act, and now we have learnt a lesson. We know deep down that there will be no stability if it is not rooted in democracy. I think we should acknowledge that we have learnt a lesson. When we talk about Syria, we should, in fact, resist contemplating whether it would not be even worse if President Assad were cast aside. The truth has to be that President Assad no longer has any legitimacy, whatever we may fear in terms of a period of chaos.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that people seek democracy. They want personal integrity. Even if we did not expect this to happen in North Africa in those countries that we have discussed in the debate today, we know deep down that sooner or later, people in general will succeed in reaching a situation where they can feel free and respected.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to emphasise what several people have said: let us involve Turkey more in this discussion. Historically speaking, Turkey has been a very significant country.

The demand for freedom and democracy, the demand for rule of law and respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms for which these countries are fighting, are precisely the foundations of the European construct.</p>
      <p sl="el">The massive danger today, several months after the uprisings started, would be to demonstrate that, as a Union, we apply double standards to these major events. Following the inability of the European states to take a uniform stand on the question of Libya, the Union is being extremely hesitant on the question of Syria, a country in which the bloodshed has exceeded all precedents.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union should immediately demand the removal of the accessory in crime, Bashar al-Assad, who, despite his pronouncements, continues to massacre the country. It should also be noted that there has been no proper condemnation of the intervention of foreign forces in Bahrain. The Union cannot turn a selective blind eye to military intervention.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to send a clear, strong message, which illustrates our determination to support the fight for democracy in these countries, and to speak out with one voice against repression and violence at this very crucial time.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioners, democracy is now required in the Arab countries to take the place of authoritarian governments. The political system in many of these countries, however, is very undeveloped, and, unfortunately, there are no true democratic leaders emerging. The alternatives for the future in these countries are, at worst, military rule or extreme Islamist regimes, and certainly not the democracy that all of us here so badly want to see. Fortunately, though, recent developments in Morocco and Tunisia offer a small hope of improvement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The forthcoming parliamentary elections in Egypt, in particular, are crucial in many ways. If the Muslim Brotherhood comes to power in the country, they are not going to bring peace: instead, they will jeopardise the entire peace process in the Middle East and, for example, Israel’s right to exist. In Syria and Libya, terrorism is also a major threat. Syria still has close relations with Iran, from where weapons are also transported to the Hezbollah in Lebanon. That is why it is extremely important to bring a resolution against Syria in the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Human rights abuses have increased in Arab countries in connection with the uprisings. Furthermore, recently, in a letter sent to the Commission and the Council by four organisations representing Algeria, there was an appeal made for the Union to give more attention to the serious breaches of freedom of speech and religion that have taken place in that country, including the closure of Christian churches. Commissioners, I hope that the European Union will show determination and duly intervene in cases like these.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, ‘Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free’ is the opening phrase of the European Security strategy of 2003. That is only eight, not 50, years ago. We were wrong to ignore the fact that stabilising our neighbourhood – something on which that happy condition depended – is a relentless task in need of constant monitoring. From that standpoint, it has to be said that we failed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite our extensive set of programmes and policies undertaken over a number of years, the region, rather than being stabilised, exploded, because we committed two strategic mistakes. We approached the entire effort mainly bureaucratically and we talked only to the people in power, avoiding deeper probing into those societies. Then, how did we react when all was suddenly in flames? With a lot of effort and some luck – the new reality coinciding with our Neighbourhood Policy review – we managed to put in extra money, directed more effectively towards the real needs of these societies in profound transformation, while establishing contact with the emerging leaderships there.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let us not fool ourselves: we are in for a huge, long-term effort of supporting state-building, which requires a strategic rather than a bureaucratic approach, and the end of which, we hope, will be a more balanced and intimate relationship with these regions, without our customary arrogance of appearing to know best what others really need.</p>

Among all the Maghreb countries, the situation of Libya seems to me especially worrying since it is at the gates of Europe and has abundant oil reserves. We have been at war a long time and the situation appears to be stagnating.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the EU should do everything possible to achieve two objectives: that Colonel Gaddafi leaves the country and, also, that Libya enjoys a stable situation and becomes a democratic state, and does not run the risk of degenerating into a failed state which could be infiltrated by al-Qaeda, which would be a very dangerous and worrying situation for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, an ungovernable state, the massive return of emigrants to their countries of origin and, above all, of armed Tuaregs, could cause a conflict situation in the neighbouring countries. Libya is an Arab state but, above all, it is an African state, and I think it is very important to take into account the opinion of the neighbouring states of the Sahel in connection with this country’s situation.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, as a result of the rapid political developments in the Arab world, the international community and, first and foremost, the European Union, now faces two crucial dilemmas:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, how to support the demand of people in the Arab world for freedom and democracy without, at the same time, upsetting the stability of an extremely important area of the world from Morocco to Yemen and putting international security at risk.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second dilemma is how to avoid a policy of double standards when it comes to protecting human rights in those countries, in all the Arab Spring countries, given that the situation in these countries differs from one country to the next.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, so far, no solution has been found to either of these two dilemmas. Thus, the situation in the Arab world looks like an equation with no constants, just numerous ‘x’ factors.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore face a huge challenge. I recognise that the newly formed External Action Service is literally undergoing a baptism of fire under extremely difficult circumstances, such as in Libya. However, that cannot be the reason or pretext for not demanding a faster response, more efficient coordination, better action planning and a European voice.</p>
      <p sl="el">The slow-burning and lacklustre reactions of the international community and of Europe to the barbarity of the Assad regime are, unfortunately, provoking feelings of indignation and shame. This is a policy of double standards at its very worst. This policy must be changed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Short-sighted tyrants and sometimes religious fundamentalism have led to violence and disorder, but also revolutions that are freeing some territories from these ferocious and vicious tyrants, who are often incapable of listening to the voices of their people. The summit of dissidents in Syria in recent days, testifies to the possible turn towards a national dialogue that we trust can bring about a new and more fruitful relationship between the opposition and President Assad.</p>
      <p sl="it">The unresolved issue of the Middle East does not lessen the complexity of a time that sees other conflicts looming between Syria and Turkey and problematic regulation of erratic migratory flows to the West. Even in Lebanon, the climate has greatly deteriorated and all this affects the stability of the area. We are not talking about Libya because others have done so.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are though, surprisingly, positive signs: in Morocco, the referendum that has just taken place indicated 98.5% in favour of constitutional reform, and a very high percentage, 72%, of the population voted.

      <p sl="mt">We are going to check out the conditions at the camps and speak to the refugees so as to gauge the effectiveness of the humanitarian aid given by the European Union.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Syrian poet, Adonis, has written an open letter to President Assad in which he addresses the President and says that no one believes that democracy can be instituted in Syria immediately after the fall of the current regime; rather, it is unbelievable and unrealistic for Syria to continue the systematic violence to re-establish order. He adds that that is the problem and that it is necessary to lay the foundations of democracy from the outset, now, and not tomorrow. He then says that, on the other hand, without democracy, there will only be a retreat to the abyss.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ‘abyss’ the poet is talking about is growing larger every day in Syria: people filming are being shot, children of even 11 years of age are being imprisoned, some army officials are starting to become discontented and starting to desert. Many would follow them if they could more easily cross the borders with neighbouring states. Even today, the Corriere della Sera, in analysing the situation in Syria, states that in Syria, the protest is not abating, Assad is not stepping down and the world does not see.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a short while ago, in the spring of 2010, I and colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs visited Syria to discuss refugee resettlement. I recall that last year, we passed resolutions on this issue in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">We established while we were there that Syria had already opened its borders, unlike neighbouring countries, and had agreed, due to the disturbances in the area as a whole, to accept hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Palestinians under extremely difficult conditions. Even back then, we all recognised the risk that all these people, with the help of the trafficking gangs we are all familiar with, would be free to take action in neighbouring Turkey to reach Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">We all realise that this risk is more visible than ever today and that it is, of course, being fuelled by the political disturbances in Syria which, as we have already heard at length, is causing even Syrian citizens to take the refugee route. For example, according to our information, over 10 000 refugees have already arrived in Turkey and 5 000 are already amassed on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition to what has already been said about managing the problems, Baroness Ashton, the European Union needs to act quickly and to take measures in preparation for a possible new influx of immigrants and refugees, so that it can nip the problem in the bud, rather than being called on to deal with it after the event, and can set up a cooperation framework like the one it is trying to set up with the countries of North Africa.</p>

The Member States of the Union that are currently present on its territory are providing financial and material support to one side against the other. I am not defending Gaddafi’s regime, far be it from me. What worries me is that we very well know the long-term consequences of such a two-sided policy: we create antagonisms, we reinforce differences of opinion within a country, spelling disaster for decades to come.</p>

When we began, I think it was Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra who said that we had to make sure we met people’s expectations – those of our people and those of the people of the region we are seeking to support. In a sense, that idea frames all of the contributions that honourable Members have made in the course of the debate this afternoon.</p>

Honourable Members have come up with important new ways in which we could support the people of Syria and extend our action. Extending sanctions is something we have done twice already, and we will continue to look at that option. Mr Verhofstadt described the idea of some 200 families being included in this respect, and we will certainly take that idea forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that the desire to see safety provided for the people on the ground leads us to wonder how best we can achieve that – beyond the exhortations, the words and the pressure at the Security Council, and collaboration with our neighbours – and several speakers mentioned the idea of a safe zone. However, it is important to understand that providing some kind of safe zone for people on the ground would require a Security Council resolution: otherwise, it would be illegal under international law. Many of the roles and ideas that honourable Members have suggested are already being worked on, in one way or another, in our work in New York.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is interesting, too, that next week, there will be a debate at the UN on the whole question of responsibility to protect, and it will be interesting to see what emerges there as a result of these issues, not least in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members asked too whether we can do more with diplomats. We keep a delegation on the ground because their job is to continue talking to the people of Syria, and that is what they do. We have a head of delegation. We have removed people whom we have been able to move out of the country to safety, but we have a head of delegation and a very small team, and I really do pay tribute to the people who remain through all this turmoil and continue to support the work of the European Union. The work of the head of delegation is very much about day-to-day contacts with civil society and groups of intellectuals, talking to people about what is happening, and also continuing to make approaches to, and put pressure on, the government on our behalf.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hear what people say about asking Member States to remove ambassadors, and that is a tool we could look at. I could recommend it, though I cannot enforce it, but I am also very keen to do as we have done in the case of Libya, which is to keep talking to ambassadors about what they believe is happening in their respective countries. You will know that many ambassadors to Libya have ended up deciding that their future does not lie there. However, this is an issue we will continue to consider.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the message about the children who are in prison is a significant one and I absolutely agree with it. It is essential that we continue the pressure to have all children taken out of prison. We will do all that we can within the operational framework we have, and we will continue to work with our partners, not least with Turkey, which many have mentioned as a key partner here. I have already indicated that we are in touch with Turkey, that I am in touch with Foreign Minister Davutoglu, and that we are supporting Turkish efforts not only in relation to the work with refugees – and we have met refugees in Turkey – but also as Turkey continues to make its own representations in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a concern, which I described, about the echoes from Syria that go across to Lebanon, and about the question of Hezbollah. It is true that the Mikati government is supported by Hezbollah, but Mr Mikati is not a man of Hezbollah. I think we need to try and give this government a chance to succeed. Our resources are directed at civil society and the development of the economy and an independent judiciary and, of course, we fund the special tribunal. The amount of assistance is EUR 50 million, not the figure of EUR 200 million which was mentioned by one honourable Member.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members have also worried about Iran. Of course we have enormous concern about what is happening in terms of the development of their nuclear weapons programme. As you know, I have worked very hard to try and get the talks moving. We have had two rounds. I have just written to Dr Saeed Jalili in response to his letter to me, saying once again that what we have put on the table remains there, and that we are open to ideas they might put forward for taking us into a new round of talks – but with the purpose of finding a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also continuing our pressure on them for human rights violations. I said earlier that I have issued a statement today on what has been happening to women in Iran, but we have also taken action and sanctions against those who prevent people from having their human rights fully and properly recognised.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we discussed a number of what I would call rather more internal issues, so let me deal with those briefly. When we decide to have an EU Special Representative, we look for the person whom we believe can best do the job in hand. Stefan Füle and I and the 27 Foreign Ministers and other Commissioners spend a lot of our time in our neighbourhood and our region. We are your political eyes and ears. We are the people who perform that political function. Sometimes, a Special Representative who has ministerial experience is incredibly valuable, and sometimes we are looking for different skills. In the case of the Special Representative for the southern Mediterranean, I looked for somebody who had strong and long diplomatic experience, especially in that neighbourhood, to back up what Stefan Füle and I do – not to replace it but to back it up – by being able to bring together at a different level the type of people we bring together at a ministerial level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to the task force idea, a lot of work goes on internally. Stefan Füle particularly is tireless in bringing various people together, but what I was looking for was a response to those who say ‘You need to engage the international financial institutions and countries that wish to support the neighbourhood but to do it collaboratively with the EU’. At that level, it would be ministerial, and Stefan and I would be there, but the question is about how we bring in extra resources, through the EU Special Representatives, to do particular jobs. I know that Bernardino León – whose reputation goes before him, not just in Europe – will do a superb job on behalf of us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not rule out involving ministers. I know Miguel Moratinos well. To the Brazilians who were here, I extend my congratulations on their countryman’s appointment to the director-generalship of the FAO, but you will understand, too, that I may have supported my dear friend Miguel for that role. I hope we will see him engaged again in European issues, alongside many others whom honourable Members may propose.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree, too, about the involvement of local people in our planning. ‘Planning for Real’ was something in which I was engaged for many years, and it is about local people having the opportunity to work together to decide what their local communities will be. It is of absolutely core importance to having the sort of communities that are sustainable and can be developed for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Lunacek, specifically in response to your point about money: the figures are EUR 750 million of new money, and EUR 490 million either in programmes that are under-spent or in money we have recycled in other ways. So the total figure is much higher than you had feared. All of the indicative programmes are now being reviewed to make sure that they fit, and all of the instruments will be revised in order to make sure that they fit with the new strategy and, just as importantly, that they are tailored to be able to respond to the needs of each country. We are doing this as swiftly as we can because one of the challenges, as honourable Members have rightly pointed out, is to ensure we respond in good time to needs which are already very obvious.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similar considerations apply in relation to mobility. We have proposed working with each country to establish mobility partnerships, visa facilitation agreements and visa liberalisation arrangements. We agree that mobility is really important, as is trade. I agree completely with those who argue that, by supporting engagement with the markets in these countries, and particularly with small businesses, which are the backbone of all economies, we will gain because we will be creating new markets for ourselves. And we know the consequences of not doing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that we want to build the Union for the Mediterranean secretariat to take forward the six regional projects, and we are working on that right now.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will finish with a couple of key points. First of all, in relation to the Middle East peace process, what I commit to is to do my best. We have worked very hard. I have spent more time, since I took office, on the Middle East peace process than on any other issue. We work tirelessly and we work with all parties, across the region and internationally, in trying to achieve what we all know is the right answer: two countries, side by side, living in peace and security for generations to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">The challenge for us is how to try, now even harder than ever, to make that scenario a reality on the ground. More than anything else, for the Palestinian people, the issue that is going to be of enormous significance in the coming weeks and months is that of getting a country that is sustainable – a state that is theirs. More than anything else, for the people of Israel, achieving that with the security of Israel at the heart of the arrangements is going to be what matters. From my point of view, this is not about being pro one side or the other. The desired solution is for both of them, and I want to see both of them achieving that as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">More than ever – with the changing neighbourhood and the challenges economically and politically – the time to do this is absolutely now. I will say that on Monday, and I will do my best to get us to the point that I know we have to be at. I am prepared to fail, by being prepared to be as strong as I possibly can be.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree on many of the things about which people feel passionately in relation to Gaza. I really understand that. Going into Gaza to see the circumstances there, particularly for children and young people, is really tough. It is really tough to see kids in schools that are running double shifts – children who want what our kids want, what all kids in Europe want, the same kind of lives – and knowing what the difficulties are. We have to find ways to alleviate the problems of Gaza and to deliver for the people I have met there who want everything that I want: economic security, a good education for their children, somewhere to live, to feel safe and to have a future. That is what we have to deliver and we have to deliver it in the best possible way. I think this is about getting the crossings open and finding a solution for the people of Gaza that brings them peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have also seen the rockets that have been launched into Israel. I went and saw racks and racks of them, and I saw that children had to play underground because of fear of the rocket attacks. Again, we have to do what we are doing for both sides. We have to understand that the solution must give both communities the future and the security that people want, and we will do everything we can to that end.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, there are many points we could have discussed which I did not raise now because we have discussed them before. Camp Ashraf, I know, is really important. I get more letters from you on that than on any other matter, and you know that I am working with Foreign Ministers and internationally to try to find a suitable solution. Finding our way through that issue is very complicated and difficult, but we are engaged with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issues concerning religious groups, Coptic Christians and others, again this is something I raise with all of the countries concerned and something about which we have not forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final point concerns South Sudan. When I leave tonight, I will head back to Brussels and then out to Juba to represent the European Union at the birth of a new country. I met with the Foreign Minister from the north this week and I made it very clear to him that we expect them to do what they need to do to prevent the fighting that is going on in South Kordofan, and to make sure that we do not have spillover violence in Blue Nile. I am really alarmed about what is happening at the borders there and I am alarmed at the prospects for this new country, in terms of what is needed to enable them to cope. But we will be with them, and my purpose in being there as they raise their flag is to convey that the European Union will be there, not just on the day the country comes into being, but also in the long term, to build the deep democracy and the strong economy that we know the people want and deserve.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Tunisia and Egypt give hope to the whole region. They show that a positive outcome is possible, that their peoples’ efforts are not in vain. We must continue to support them, listen to them and offer them assistance that meets their expectations and their needs. However, this progress, these hopes should not make us lose sight of the difficulties faced by other countries in the region.</p>

However, we must not forget to use the institutions in place, since they already benefit from a network and a certain influence in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">After months of intervention and non-action, wishful thinking and short-sightedness, strategic confusion and tactical opportunism, an assessment of the spring 2011 developments in the Arab world and North Africa shows the following: 1. The events are a replica of the geostrategic quake which took place in Eastern and Central Europe in 1989; 2. Notwithstanding the specificity of each country concerned, the general refusal of the people to accept authority (in whatever form) any longer constitutes the common triggering factor; 3. Similarly to 1989, the transformation was not prepared or initiated by the Euro-Atlantic democracies; 4. The Euro-Atlantic players are trying, again as with 1989, to become protagonists by exporting their democratic model post-factum; 5. As usual, the Euro-Atlantic players, desirous to externalise their internal crises or to fulfil their national geopolitical ambitions, apply multiple standards, thus undermining the coherence of any future regional policy; 6. External military intervention can only undermine the equilibrium and complicate the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background, one can understand why, after unwisely trying to behave like an international cop, the EU, too divided to be strong and too nervous to be prudent, has no perspective; but one can only hope that things will eventually end well. Unfortunately, hope is not a policy!</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU external policies in favour of democratisation (2011/2032(INI)) (A7-0231/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-479-000" speaker_id="22097" name="Véronique De Keyser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, allow me first to thank my fellow Members who have widely contributed to this report on democratisation to the extent that at times, I struggle to keep up. However, they did it in an extremely positive spirit and their contribution helped to enrich the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, what does this report contain? Firstly, it was largely inspired by what happened in North Africa and by these Arab revolutions. Indeed, all this has created a problem for us, the European Union. Has what we have done in relation to past regimes and the use we have made of the instruments at our disposal really helped us to support democracy to any real extent? The first answer is no. We did not support democracy, we supported what we hoped to be stability in the region, but stability without democracy can also lead to a police state.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, a complete rethink was needed and today, this report proposes a few suggestions. The first suggestion is slightly philosophical, but it is fundamental: let us rebuild our policies towards our neighbours according to our values, values that we share and, in particular, democracy. That is what must come first.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second suggestion is to dare, to dare play the card of political democracy a bit more. We played the democracy card by telling ourselves ‘As long as there is development and economic growth in a country, democracy will follow’. No, democracy does not always follow. Of course, wealth can be distributed very unevenly. Therefore, we must also be able to support political and democratic structures in those countries and act as a political guide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At present, with these transitions and the world undergoing massive changes, we come to realise that we may not have all the necessary instruments to precisely provide political support to these democracies. We have election observation missions, but these are not enough; we must follow up on things, we must do more follow-up and the report mentions this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point that the report raises is that we must support the civil societies and the influential stakeholders within these civil societies, and there is no shortage of examples to show that there are many new civil stakeholders who can play a decisive role in these democratic transitions, such as a free press, the Internet, women, unions, youth associations and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the main elements of the report. Now, have we got the required instruments? We have numerous instruments. Currently, there are many instruments that can be used in a more consistent and effective way for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have the instrument of the Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, but we also have, as per the Treaty of Lisbon, the ability to make better use of our trade agreements; we have the stability instrument, we have a whole range of instruments. Now, is all that enough? Are these instruments effective? Do they go straight to the point? Are they reactive, proactive, fast-acting? Well, they may not be proactive enough and fast-acting enough, and we probably need to strengthen and improve them. Should we create new ones? I needed a great deal of persuading and we, or rather the Polish Presidency, came up with a splendid project: ‘Endowment for democracy’. I said to myself ‘Yet another instrument, when we have not even made full use of all the others!’</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, in the end, what is the outcome of these thoughts today? We are not against. We are not against this splendid project of the Polish Presidency. Poland has a long history and fine examples of democratisation to show us. Only, we do not think that this should replace what is there already. We believe that all this should remain under the European Parliament’s control, if money from the budget has been used to fund it. We believe that this project should not be too unwieldy, that it should not add an extra administrative burden, but that it can be interesting, used in an ad hoc fashion, to fund some stakeholders who are difficult to fund through the current instruments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is, in a nutshell, the approach we have taken in our work. While for us, this project still has some way to go, we have made progress on both sides before achieving a final outcome today; we think that it is a worthwhile project which needs to be taken up, but at present, we are still not quite in agreement as to the European Parliament’s positions nor as to the Polish project. However, we need to continue the negotiations and I am sure that they will be conclusive.</p>

    <intervention id="3-480-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I begin by thanking Véronique De Keyser very much for her work. In her report, she says human rights must be central to all EU policies. I agree so much with that. I should also like to put on record my thanks to Heidi Hautala, who has now gone off to a new job but who did such a fantastic job as Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is very important. It is a great commentary on what we were able to do in terms of foreign policy and democracy, but it also enables us to consider the responsibilities we have to ensure that people in all countries benefit from the same rights as us. We cannot take those rights for granted. While, of course, the Middle East and North Africa are in the spotlight, we know that in Belarus, President Lukashenko continues to suppress any form of opposition, and that is why we led a cross-regional initiative to record our condemnation of Belarus at the June meeting of the UN Human Rights Council. The resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority.</p>
      <p sl="en">I raise that example to show that this policy of engagement, a policy where we work with the people on the ground but are clear in our stance against regimes, is very important. At the UN, we were very active last year, not least because of the review of the UN Human Rights Council. We had some real successes in Geneva, including the renewal of the mandates of various UN Special Rapporteurs – on Burma, DPRK, Sudan, Somalia, Cambodia and Haiti – and resolutions on the DRC, Guinea, Kurdistan and freedom of religion, a very important issue that is often raised in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also reached all our objectives at the Third Committee of the General Assembly in New York. The resolution in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty was passed with great support, and a resolution against religious intolerance was adopted by consensus.</p>
      <p sl="en">We celebrated, too, in 2010 the tenth anniversary of Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, and we adopted a set of indicators to monitor our progress on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these are examples of what can be achieved when the EU speaks as one. The fact that we speak at the UN as one now offers even greater potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right, too, that we review our policies to ensure, as Ms De Keyser says, that ‘values, consistency and a genuine culture of results’ are absolutely at the heart of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report goes on to stress the need to develop further the political dimension of our work, to match what we do on development. We have a good basis for doing that, though I am sure it will not be easy. These strands were brought together in the policy of ‘democracy support’ set out in our Council Conclusions of November 2009. We went on to designate 12 countries for pilot implementation of our ‘Agenda for Action’.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, too, when we think about the idea of a ‘European Endowment for Democracy’, for me the capacity to help young people, in particular, to join that democratic dialogue by using new technology, will play an important part in advancing that process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes we have to be bold, and I think that is essential in terms of how we now approach the report and take this work forward. I believe that we have to choose stability and democracy; I believe that we need to be creative in our response to these rapidly evolving challenges. No simple task to deliver, but I think this contribution enriches our debate and helps us move towards achieving it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree with Véronique De Keyser that women are a vital part of a well-functioning democracy. They can play an important role in establishing a democratic culture, deeply rooted in society.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East sent a strong message that the empowerment of women and their equal and active participation in decision making and conflict resolution is a crucial element and a prerequisite for a successful democratisation process and for the socio-economic development of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore stress the crucial role of the EU in promoting gender equality and mainstreaming in its external relations with third countries. This can be done through various programmes and the exchange of best practices and know-how and by assuring the availability of necessary funding for education, training, awareness-raising and empowerment for women, as well as for the continuous fight against gender violence, stereotypes and discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, when we talk about democracy, it is not merely a humanitarian responsibility; it is, in fact, our duty under the EU Treaty to work for democratisation. Sometimes our eagerness for democratisation has perhaps been presented as if we are pursuing some sort of cultural imperialism, to put it strongly. That is obviously not the case, but rather every individual, irrespective of religion, culture and tradition, has an inviolable responsibility. To use a word that Baroness Ashton used, I would like us to be a little bolder in this area and to work a little more vigorously precisely to bring about democratisation. The fact is, this is not about a kind of democracy that brings freedom alone; it is specifically about democracy that involves respect for an individual’s inviolable worth and dignity.</p>

    <intervention id="3-483-000" speaker_id="96651" name="Eduard Kukan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, sincere thanks to Ms De Keyser for all her good work in preparing this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad that we are having this discussion at a time of democratisation changes in many places in the world. Democracy is Europe’s core value. Yet its role in the EU’s external relations has been somewhat less tangible. The revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East give us a chance to learn and design new policies more focused on democracy support. To be honest, it is not only the southern neighbourhood where democracy needs to be supported. Our efforts have a much broader reach. We should not forget our eastern neighbours. EU democracy support should develop through a new range of instruments, built on the EU’s past experience, including that of Central Europe. The benefits could be clear and straightforward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest reforms at institutional and policy level raised expectations, especially in partner countries where the lack of a more coordinated and coherent EU voice is often perceived as a serious shortcoming. This is the reason why the report calls for the shift of paradigm in EU democratisation in external policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in the report, we are calling for the establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy. This could be a good and useful tool. It is necessary to be more flexible in the allocation of external funds and respond more rapidly to democratisation trends in third countries. However, if the endowment is to bring added value, it should not overlap with existing instruments. All in all, I believe that the report will be a good base for reflection on changes which should take place in order to have a more effective democratisation policy in the EU’s external relations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-484-000" speaker_id="2073" name="Richard Howitt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a report which is not about saying we support democracy, but how we do it. We support the idea, originally put forward by the Socialist and Democrat Group in this Parliament in the human rights report for a European Endowment for Democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are concerned with proposals from the Polish Presidency which seem to replicate the European initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR). I support those. High Representative Ashton herself this afternoon argued that a network amongst existing organisations rather than a new heavy-handed or expensive agency is preferable in creating the endowment. If democracy can come from Facebook pages and tweets by the young people of North Africa, Europe itself could use virtual technology to achieve our own aims for democratisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, election observation missions really are some of the most successful external actions we as Europe make. But we need to understand that we are sometimes blocked where we are most needed, including, I regret to say, currently by the military government in Egypt. We can do better targeting missions where we can most make a difference as well as in the follow up of the recommendations in the final report in our other country-specific actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, to those who are worried about those who would use democracy to defeat democracy, let us acknowledge that this is a problem in many of our countries. Which is why we designed the rules of the EIDHR carefully, to allow us not to choose for people of third countries but to directly support reform and opposition movements to ensure that there is a choice to be made.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is difficult territory, but we asked the European External Action Service and Commission to exploit these rules to full effect. Let us agree with the axiom, ‘democracy cannot be imported or exported, but it can be supported’.</p>

    <intervention id="3-485-000" speaker_id="28242" name="Alexander Graf Lambsdorff" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her excellent report. This report has a normative section and an operative section. In the normative section, we try to establish a European consensus on what, from our point of view, constitutes democracy, what it absolutely must encompass. The Council has been unable to come to such agreement for years, because the Member States have very different traditions. Nonetheless, I believe that we can all agree that what we have included in recitals C to O are clearly elements of democracy which must be taken into account when promoting democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The operative section deals with the instruments. What instruments are available to us? The EIDHR has been mentioned. We find that it is often too slow, too bureaucratic, too complicated and has scope for improvement. The Instrument for Stability could also be faster. The report states that we always react in an immediate and integrated manner to situations; however, it took weeks before election workers could be sent to Tunisia to provide technical assistance under the Instrument for Stability. There is still a lot of work to do here. That is why the European Endowment for Democracy is being discussed, because we want a faster, more flexible instrument. I believe – and this is important and applies to all the groups – that there are some who are more enthusiastic, while others are somewhat more reticent. We need clarification from the European External Action Service, from the Commission and from the Polish Presidency of the Council, which considers this an important project. Where are the boundaries between the instruments that we have and what a European Endowment for Democracy is supposed to do? Who does what with which instruments and when?</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Howitt addressed the question of election observations in this context. I believe that this is very important. Please look at paragraphs 60 to 63: they contain this House’s view on election monitoring. We want stringent criteria for selecting countries; we are of the opinion that they are not always stringent enough. We want comprehensive political concepts. We want recommendations to be followed-up. I think these are some of the points that need to be highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="de">What happens next? This report contains numerous calls for action, by the EEAS and by Parliament. How can we make sanctions more effective? How can we make the instruments more effective? What are we doing for women and democracy, for gender equality? What are we doing in the EEAS delegations across the world? There are numerous calls for action to be drawn from this report. Let us get to work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, this report contains a host of sensible measures to promote the process of democratisation and deserves our full support.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in this context, I should like to discuss the establishment of a foundation to foster democracy, the European Endowment for Democracy, which is also intended to support societies in upheaval. However, we are not absolutely clear here as to what the precise remit of this new foundation should be. We witnessed a comprehensive debate on this issue in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, but again we were not clear as to what the added value is, compared to the application of the Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy. Certainly, the Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy needs to be improved, for example, in terms of flexibility or the facility for faster response. However, I think that it would be of no help to anyone if we were to agree to set up an Endowment for Democracy in what is still an unclear situation. We must, come what may, avoid creating overlaps.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also discussed the fact that we want to set up a mechanism to promote civil society. When we asked, no one could explain or perhaps no one has worked out what this monitoring mechanism will entail. Thus, there is a lack of clarity here too. Until such time as these questions have been answered, we are unable to agree to an Endowment for Democracy. Obviously, we are worried about what the financing will involve. As it is assumed in the concept that individual Member States will finance this Endowment for Democracy and this may not succeed, this begs a second question: will it be at the expense of existing instruments? If this were to prove to be the case, we would again reject it.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for the spirit of cooperation which she demonstrated towards us. I think that the report rightly calls for the European Union to revise its stand on its external policy, especially in the sector referred to as the promotion of democracy, so that there are no double standards on the part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">In other words, a binding precondition to any agreements with the Union must be real respect for human rights and the people in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">We support the view that democracy and security cannot exist without full and universal respect for human rights. We stress the need to promote respect for rights in the face of economic and political expediency. We, too, therefore underline the responsibilities and mistakes of the Union such as, for example, the mistaken insistence on restricting immigration from the countries of North Africa and on cooperation with the regimes there.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to mention our reservations:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, there are limits on the European Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, our policy is often interventionist and creates situations in third countries in various ways, without promoting human and democratic rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, we place particular emphasis on the question of funding for political parties in third countries. It is a form of intervention, especially when political, economic and other interests arise.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, unfortunately, the report does not refuse – as we would have wished – to accept EU external policy agencies and instruments to which our group is opposed, in principle, on account of the fact that these instruments are of a military nature.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is a grey area in ethical judgment called cultural relativism. What is revered in one country may be abhorred in another. Even within Europe, there are vast cultural differences. The British would never allow bullfighting, and our laws mean it is illegal to produce foie gras. Who are we, therefore, to not only dictate terms of trade but roll out costly projects to tell third countries how to think and behave?</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission evidently fancy themselves as the new UN. The EU may talk about democracy promotion, but what about democracy here? The EU ignored the results of five referendums it did not like: the Danish vote on Maastricht in 1993, the Irish vote on Nice in 2000, the French and Dutch votes on the EU constitution in 2005 and the Irish vote on Lisbon three years ago. Then the EU spends handsome amounts monitoring elections in Afghanistan and Kosovo, to absolutely no avail. It is sheer hypocrisy and arrogance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the events of the Arab Spring, which have been eloquently described by Mrs De Keyser, and the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon on the promotion of, and support for, democracy, human rights and the rule of law throughout the world, mean that we should redraft EU policies on support for democratic processes across the globe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a lack of economic stability and a lack of social stability in countries, since the priority is, and should be, the observance of human rights and democratic rules. The De Keyser report takes a very positive approach to supporting democratic processes, not only when they begin or are in progress, but also wherever we are dealing with underground activities by opposition movements, for example. Such activities can be seen in Belarus and Syria, for example, but also in Cuba. If it were not for the Sakharov Prize, we would certainly not be as aware of events in all these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We frequent have to deal with social discontent. The economic causes are important, but it is primarily the lack of democracy that means that we are dealing with events such as those in North Africa. I am pleased that the report includes a provision supporting the creation of a European Endowment for Democracy, which is a Polish initiative that will expand the instruments available to the EU for long-term support of democratic processes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If this endowment had existed a few years ago, we would certainly not have experienced so many problems in terms of supporting such processes, for example, in Syria or Egypt. This proposal aims to supplement existing instruments, rather than to act as competition for them. We want this instrument to be set up by means of a convention. It looks like the European Parliament will be heavily involved both in supervising measures under the endowment and monitoring its budget. I would wholeheartedly urge Members to support Amendment 11, which relates to this project.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there are a number of paradoxes within the report. It calls for EU measures to be made more individual, by tailoring them to each country, but, at the same time, it also calls for double standards to be removed from European policies. This is something I, too, also support wholeheartedly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs De Keyser, for this report, which is absolutely necessary in the current context. I hope that the proposals put forward in this report will be implemented. It would really mark great progress if we managed to make the issue of social justice and the fight against inequalities key objectives of the European Union’s external policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As both Lady Ashton and Mrs De Keyser have pointed out, the revolutions in the Arab world highlight once again that poverty goes hand in hand with the restriction of freedoms. Just like any society, the more prosperous it is in economic terms, the more extensive the rights it offers its citizens and the more democracy they have.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Breaches of fundamental rights, such as the right to work, education and health, unfair distribution of incomes, marginalisation of women and ever-growing poverty and disparities are some of the factors causing the changes taking place recently in the world and especially in North Africa. However, these states must realise that it is not enough to get rid of the tyranny of dictatorship.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As someone who comes from a country which, two decades ago, still lived under dictatorship, I would like to say that democracy without social justice is never complete. Indeed, dictatorial tendencies, abuses and intimidation are still possible, especially in impoverished societies because, as I have said, poverty and inequality seriously undermine progress towards democracy. This is why I believe that it is appropriate for us to place greater emphasis on respect for citizens’ rights, not only political but socio-economic as well. I hope, Commissioner, that the new Human Rights and Democracy Directorate within the European External Action Service will also bear in mind this aspect of the process of establishing democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, like others, I would like to congratulate Veronique De Keyser who produced an extremely comprehensive and helpful report. I would also like to address the question of the European Endowment for Democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to recall, some 20 years ago, after the revolution in Central and Eastern Europe, I founded the EIDHR as a mechanism that was not part of the EU, but it was financed by us. It was at arms length and it remained so for about ten years until it was taken in-house by the European Commission and then became, for a period, very safe, very bureaucratic and almost totally useless.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fortunately, in recent years, under the people who were here present in the Chamber, it has improved considerably. But it still cannot do everything that we need it to do, especially in the Arab world. So many people have mentioned this and I will do so too.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I would ask colleagues to keep the door open to a mechanism which is capable of doing things that EIDHR cannot do and should not do. That is why it is so important that there is some sort of compromise tomorrow on this report, on paragraph 35, to encourage the thing to go forward.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs De Keyser. The existence of a democratic system is essential to relations between the EU and third countries as a shared value. The report being discussed today promotes the consolidation of this aspect as part of the future agreements negotiated on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon. I should mention that the EU is a leading global player in the protection of human rights and respect for conditionality helps spread these principles.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With this in mind, I support the clearer wording in the clause on democracy featuring in the text of trade agreements with third countries. I also think that a mechanism needs to be introduced for monitoring the proper implementation of these provisions. The budget support offered by the EU must target the same aim: local development of civil society. Only democracy that has been built within the state is viable. This is the way to ensure long-term, sound, effective cooperation with the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I thank and congratulate Mrs De Keyser for her excellent and relevant report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, let us be careful to avoid the ‘paternalistic and pretending to know what is best’ behaviour that Europeans have often been criticised for. I believe that we have the duty, when promoting democratisation outside our borders, to respect the customs and traditions of each country. Simply copying and pasting cannot work. History is indeed there to remind us of that. Our model of democracy should not be lived like a sanction and has a duty to be integrated harmoniously within the host country. A word of warning, however: impunity should be fought against.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns the crucial role of election observation missions and their monitoring. The Union has at its disposal here a unique instrument that democratically approves, if I may say so, a democratic process. The European Parliament is entitled to observe the process. It needs to be more involved in this monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, I am cautious about any idea of new instruments. I think that it is more important to make more operational and yet more effective the provisions that already exist, as well as all the mechanisms at our disposal in the Treaties.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to take the floor. I read the De Keyser report very attentively. It really is a very interesting and very well-written report. Yet one of the things it shows is that we are dealing not only with positive trends, but also with problems, which must be a cause for concern to all of us in this Chamber. As far as the positive trends are concerned, I believe that what is most important is that it is abundantly clear that the EU has been paying a great deal more attention in recent months to extending democratic values outside the territory of the EU. It is abundantly clear that the EU is reconstructing its Neighbourhood Policy. However, we cannot agree whether the instruments to be used are good or excellent. I would therefore like to lend my wholehearted support to Poland’s initiative to create an Endowment for Democracy, and to encourage others to do the same. This is a good idea, and it should be supported.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I do not take democracy for granted because, for the first 21 years of my life, I lived under dictatorship. So I know the importance of support for those forces who want to fight against oppression and of democratic support for building capacity for the financial and organisational support. That is the reason why, already in 2010, I proposed, in the context of the Annual Report on Human Rights of this Parliament, an amendment talking about an endowment for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I welcome this report by Véronique De Keyser, which is so comprehensive and so good, and which contains this particular proposal. In my opinion, this endowment needs to be something that will be very flexible, very quick, and which will not compete with the funds allocated to the Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy. That will be new money. And it will not be duplicating what, for example, the European political foundations are already doing. It requires strong cross-party parliamentary control on the part of this Parliament and obviously it is meant to support all these young people, all these brave women, all those brave men, and all those political parties in the independent media who are trying to be established in our neighbourhood.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that the pro-democratic orientation of European external policy is an entirely understandable and legitimate aim. In today’s complex world, however, it will not be that easy. Mrs De Keyser has already stated in her introductory speech that we have previously promoted stability rather than democracy. We should, however, ask whether democracy can emerge at all in a divided political environment. If so, then it can only be in exceptional circumstances. I therefore think that the decision to promote stability was a good one, although it is important, following the stabilisation of the political environment, to take the next step of promoting democracy, if this has not happened already during the stabilisation process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">European foreign policy activities must not, therefore, end once the political environment has been stabilised, but must continue with the further aim of democratising society. I firmly believe that the EU instruments currently used for supporting European policy may be very effective in achieving this objective. We only have to learn how to use them better and more consistently so that they can fulfil the tasks for which they are required.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we know that, as Europeans, we should naturally have a vital interest in the gradual democratisation of Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The influence of the European Union helps to further this democratisation process, as we have seen in the Balkans. However, as regards Turkey, with which we are still in accession negotiations, the situation is quite different.</p>
      <p sl="de">After the Turkish elections, we have seen once again that the half-hearted belief of the EU that the problems will disappear into thin air simply at the prospect of EU accession, is a dangerous fallacy. The withdrawal of the mandate of an elected Turkish member of parliament is simply incompatible with the principles of democracy and the rule of law. That Turkey’s democratisation process is at a crossroads is clear from the fact that international election observers in Kurdish areas identified massive state interference in the elections on 12 June. This disregard for democratic principles alone is, in my opinion, reason enough to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms De Keyser for the work that she has done. I just want to bring up three very brief points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, that building democracy means we need to build deep democracy. We need to make sure that democracy takes root and is not just a process of one electoral cycle, but it is about all of the institutions that go alongside it. As Ms De Keyser says, it is linked to all of the other elements, such as development, where we need to make sure that we are helping the societies build a flourishing democracy for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, our electoral observation missions play an important part in making sure that democracy can do that. A number of Members have participated in those and I thank all of you for the work that you have done, not least, again, Ms De Keyser for her work in Sudan. Not an easy mission by any means, but one accomplished extremely well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, with regard to a proposal for an endowment for democracy: a number of times I have thought of ideas and ways in which I believe we can support the people of the region only to be told that I cannot do it, because supporting some of the political processes is impossible under the instruments of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, I want to see ways in which we can support young people to continue to be in touch with each other using the new media, using the chat rooms, Twitter, Facebook and so on. These are the ways in which they already have been in touch and the ways in which they work together in the course of changes and revolutions. These situations require new things, things that are offshore, if you like, and ways in which they can add value.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is not about replacing what we already do well; it is about doing things we simply cannot do under the instruments we currently have, but which we can identify as being of great value.</p>
      <p sl="en">The challenge for us will be to show and explain to Members that this is exactly what we have done. So please do not rule it out, but test us on the proposals that we bring forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the very wide convergence there is today in the political groups on this report is not at all down to my work. It is really due to the fact – and we have heard this in the various speeches – that this question of democracy is at the heart of European history.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When I hear some of my fellow Members point out that they have lived under Soviet occupation, Salazar’s and Franco’s dictatorships, and that they fought against these, one feels there is something that unites us, and that is what creates the unity and the real interest of this report. We want this richness, which is the European richness, to benefit others. Of course, Mrs Nedelcheva is right, not by patronising other countries, not by practising a postcolonial policy, but by respecting diversity. I believe that the report’s content ran along those lines. I wish you good luck, Baroness Ashton. You are about to leave for South Sudan; once again, we have a textbook case here, just like the countries that have been through the Arab revolutions this summer and earlier this year are a textbook case for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What needs to be done so that this new country where we observed the elections ends up resisting this transition, which will be very difficult and which is now bringing echoes of war with it, unfortunately? I simply suggest then, Baroness Ashton, other discussions concerning South Sudan which will serve as testing grounds and I hope that this report, which was drafted in Sudan – since I was there – will enable us, in any case, to implement this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very grateful to have the opportunity to exchange views with honourable Members on the Nagorny Karabakh conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I, along with President Barroso and President Van Rompuy, met with President Medvedev at the EU-Russia Summit, President Medvedev was optimistic about the possibilities for a breakthrough at the Kazan meeting. We made clear to President Medvedev that we fully support his personal mediation efforts and, of course, the work of the Minsk Group.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Deauville statement of Presidents Obama, Medvedev and Sarkozy made clear that the time had now come for an agreement, failing which the parties’ commitment to a solution would be questioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regrettably, despite strong messages at the highest level, the expected breakthrough at Kazan did not materialise. The Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia did not take the opportunity to reach a compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Relations between the two countries are difficult. I recently met with the Foreign Ministers of both Armenia and Azerbaijan and I do not have any illusion about the complexity of the negotiations. The co-chairs keep the EEAS fully informed of their work and the many difficulties that they face.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last Friday, I also took the opportunity to be briefed by the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, who is now Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="en">Efforts to find an agreement on the basic principles must continue, and I welcome the fact that both parties have re-committed themselves to the diplomatic process and to finding a peaceful solution. But we need to see more than that in the coming months. The parties need to redouble their efforts to find an agreement before the end of the year. This would then happen before the domestic priorities take over in 2012: elections in Armenia in 2012, and in Azerbaijan in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">A continuation of the status quo is unacceptable, as is any effort to resolve the conflict or influence the negotiations by using force, or even the threat of force.</p>
      <p sl="en">The peaceful settlement of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict is a key strategic interest of the European Union. It would also transform the South Caucasus region and would pave the way towards political and regional stability, and new economic opportunities. Borders could open not only between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but also between Armenia and Turkey. Roads, railways and pipelines could take the shortest routes, and tie the countries of the region more closely together. The South Caucasus could become what they should be already – a gateway between Europe and Asia. All of this is clearly in the interest of the European Union, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are ready and committed to stepping up our efforts in support of the work of the Minsk Group co-chairs. The negotiations have been going on since 1994 in the current format and an agreement on the basic principles is within reach. The nature of the additional support that we can provide is, of course, a matter that we need to consult with the Minsk Group co-chairs and the parties. We are holding regular consultations now on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be very clear, however. Whatever happens in these final negotiations will matter greatly to us and we will play a role in the way we shape our policy towards the two countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">On my behalf, Miroslav Lajčák, our managing director, travelled to both countries last month, and made these points very clearly. We want to see progress by the time of the planned Eastern Partnership summit in September in Warsaw. I also see clear possibilities to enhance the EU engagement outside the negotiations themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are already supporting confidence building and outreach activities to people on both sides through civil society organisations who promote people-to-people contacts, including in the framework of the Council of Europe. But we can do more.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe we need to take significant responsibilities in the implementation of a settlement, once we reach this stage, in close cooperation with our international partners. There will be much to do: reconstruction, mine clearance, refugees, internally displaced people returns, and the promotion of economic recovery and security support. I also recognise the other partners who will play a significant role in this region and once again, it will be important to work closely with our regional partner, Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have proposed the appointment of a new Representative for the South Caucasus to take these different work strands forward, in cooperation with the Minsk Group co-chairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps our most important contribution will be to continue to strengthen our bilateral relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new European Neighbourhood Policy communication, which we discussed earlier today in this Chamber, sets out an ambitious agenda for the countries of the South Caucasus: for new association agreements, deep and comprehensive free trade areas, increased and facilitated mobility, increased sectoral cooperation and participation in EU programmes and increased support for civil society and the open society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our overall objective is to help our neighbouring countries build this comprehensive agenda. In that context, we will be looking at ways in which we can enhance our bilateral cooperation in order that it can be geared to support conflict settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Stefan Füle recently visited Armenia to discuss how to take our relationship forward and to build this agenda. I believe that a more confident, attractive and modern country, in both cases with ambitious reform agendas, will be in a stronger position to overcome the difficult legacies of the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ultimately, this is a choice that the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan need to make in the best interests of the people they represent. We know the choice we want them to make: the choice of compromise and peace. We believe that we have a role to play in supporting the co-chairs of the Minsk Group to realise that ambition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, this question was given a great deal of attention in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) because we are concerned that arms consignments will start a new race between two large neighbouring countries and that this will necessarily result in hostilities. We have a duty to break this cycle, so that we do not see a repeat of the situation we experienced three years ago this summer, when hostilities suddenly broke out in the region. We should not make light of these very specific dangers. It must therefore be made clear that we are on the side of the refugees who want to return home and that the snipers have to go.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also take the view that the six principles elaborated by the Minsk Group and accepted by both sides now need to be implemented and that no more excuses should be found for dragging one’s feet. That is very important.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that the European Union has a very active role to play here. When you refer to the summit in Kazan, then I must say that I am not convinced that the third person who sat at the table was, in fact, the neutral moderator he was supposed to be. The European Union should pursue a specific policy with these countries in the Eastern Partnership and – as I have said in earlier debates – should offer these states incentives to encourage them to take a multilateral approach. We must unite their interests. We must make it clear that they will receive support from the European Union if they cooperate with each other.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not just have bilateral relations with these states, because that will not enable us to stop the race. The idea behind European unification has always been to unite interests in order to overcome the stresses of the past, making them redundant, because there are greater common interests at stake. What I said about the Neighbourhood Policy is addressed, first and foremost, to the Vice-President of the Commission. Our interest in avoiding the destabilisation of this region is paramount, because that would also alter the balance of power, which would not be in our interest for reasons of energy, security and foreign policy.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Lady Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the subject of Nagorno-Karabakh found a place in today’s session of the European Parliament. Many of us are concerned about the growing tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan and we would not want, on any account, to end up again in the situation we were in after the events in the South Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="bg">If the European Union wants stability in neighbouring regions, it needs to act now. The failure of the Kazan meeting must not be used by us as an indication that the Minsk Group might be about to run out of options.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, I want to stress that the basic responsibility for resolving the conflict lies with the leaders of both countries. Let us be clear: we cannot accept either the infinite delay to negotiations or the threats of a rapid military solution. We call for restraint and a responsible attitude. The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan must think carefully about how history will remember them: as people who brought lasting peace and prosperity to the South Caucasus, or as presidents who led their people to death and suffering.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament expressed its satisfaction that the revised European Neighbourhood Policy mentions explicitly the so-called ‘frozen conflicts’. We expect this policy to encourage deliberate cooperation not only between the relevant countries and Brussels, but between the countries themselves as well. Support for confidence-building measures must be a particular priority as far as Azerbaijan and Armenia are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I feel obliged to mention that the European Parliament makes its contribution to strengthening political contacts between both countries. Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan take an active part in the work of the Eastern Partnership Parliamentary Assembly set up in early May. Representatives of both countries co-chair one of the assembly’s important working groups.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I believe that the opportunity for the European Union’s MEPs and its eastern neighbours to work together in this multilateral environment will help them realise the simple fact that cooperation is the way to a better life for their peoples. I am counting on the Polish Presidency at the summit in Warsaw to make its contribution to the issue of ‘frozen conflicts’ moving higher up the Eastern Partnership’s agenda.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have received several alarming signals from the Nagorno-Karabakh region in recent months, despite the ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I would call on Yerevan and Baku to refrain from any activities in the conflict zone that might provoke a violent response from the other party.</p>
      <p sl="de">The failure of the Kazan Summit that took place on 24 June is a clear indication that the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group have been insufficient and further endeavours are needed. Since Armenia and Azerbaijan are target countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union should play an integral part in the resolution of the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madam High Representative, I would encourage you to address the situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, keeping in mind the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, especially in the light of the four resolutions of the United Nations Security Council on the liberation of the Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is in the interest of both the conflicting countries as well as the European Union to overcome this dispute in accordance with international law, to be able to concentrate on the economic and democratic development of the South Caucasus region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think frozen conflicts are a stumbling block which are preventing the Eastern Partnership from succeeding, especially the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which is a special case. Both are members of the Eastern Partnership, so I would call on Armenia to immediately start to withdraw from the occupied territories. But, at the same time, I would demand that Azerbaijan limits its defence budget. The Azeri military budget is higher than the total state budget of Armenia, and others have already said that there is again a danger of violent conflict there. Nevertheless, I also think that the European Union should play a more active role.</p>
      <p sl="en">What do you think, Lady Ashton? I think it would be great if the European Union replaced France in the Presidency of the Minsk Group. It should be the European Union as a whole which is represented there, leading these efforts, and not one of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think that the credibility and coherence of the European Union is at stake. If we look at the conflicts involving Transnistria, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, we speak about territorial integrity, whereas with Nagorno-Karabakh, we speak about territorial integrity and self-determination. Why this different approach?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is little known and often by means of biased information, but a clear point, which is indisputable and, I would say, fundamental, is the principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign state.</p>
      <p sl="it">The inviolability of borders must be respected: this is the case in Georgia, Moldova, Cyprus and so in Azerbaijan. There have been numerous positions adopted on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the following have been pointed out: the 2008 Helsinki declaration, four United Nations Security Council resolutions and even our Parliament has given its views on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">The territorial integrity of a sovereign state is guaranteed by international law and questioning this principle means encouraging future military attacks and attempts to change the international status quo, with destabilising consequences for the whole world.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe has a particular interest in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue because Armenia and Azerbaijan fall within the scope of the Eastern Partnership project which expressly provides for stability and collaboration between partner countries. We should therefore work towards this. Lastly, I would point out that time consolidates Armenia’s position in the occupied territories and this makes an agreement more difficult and the situation in the area riskier.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I wish to disagree with the last two speakers because the root of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lies in the decision made by the Russian Bolsheviks in the 1920s, which was totally illegal under international law, to separate a piece of Armenia and give it to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="bg">If you are not aware of it, I should tell you that in absolutely the same way, and more or less at the same time, Comintern made a decision to create a Macedonian nation, which had not existed until then. We still have problems in the Balkans arising from this decision. Thankfully, these problems did not evolve to the extent in Nagorno-Karabakh. This was down to the exceptionally good neighbourly relations Greece and Bulgaria had with the newly formed Republic of Macedonia (which still goes by the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, we need to see whether it is the same with Nagorno-Karabakh and the South Caucasus. Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, Armenia’s immediate neighbours, are conspiring to isolate it. Lady Ashton, you said that it would be great for oil pipelines and railways to take the shortest route. However, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey do not want this to happen. They are deliberately isolating Armenia. This is anything but the attitude of a good neighbour. Let us say it as it is because this attitude will not resolve the problems in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is good that this debate on Nagorno-Karabakh is being held before the summer recess although, in my opinion, it would have been even better if Parliament had passed a resolution and thus sent out a clear message to all concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am worried that we shall once again face a summer in which there is the fear that one of the parties involved will lose their nerve and that a third party will thus gain a geostrategic advantage. Parliament cannot afford to take sides in this conflict. We have to compel all sides to safeguard the six basic principles agreed in a diplomatic process.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is precisely because the status quo is not tenable that there is a risk that one of the sides will abandon this approach. It is counterproductive to arm Azerbaijan and Armenia, as Russia is obviously the main supplier to both sides. This fuels the suspicion that Russia has a hidden agenda so that, if war breaks out, it can appear to act as peace broker, while in fact re-establishing its former sphere of influence.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that the EU has much more to offer the region than anyone else: it has experience in confidence-building, cross-border cooperation, protecting minorities, establishing democratic structures, modernising economies and integrating them into a common economic area. The EU can offer both sides a win-win situation in resolving the problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am delighted that you, Baroness Ashton, recently spoke with both foreign ministers. It is precisely because the summit in Kazan failed and because Russia is perhaps not an experienced broker, that we should not allow this vacuum to remain and should ensure that the prospect of unification can be achieved for both sides.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, about one year ago, our Parliament adopted its resolution on the need for an EU strategy towards the South Caucasus with an overwhelming majority. The resolution outlined the strategic importance of this neighbouring region for the EU and the danger the unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh poses not only to the parties in the conflict but to the entire region and the EU as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ordinary people affected by the conflict continue to live in constant fear of war: isolated in poverty and without prospects for development or development aid. Nearly one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) are hostages to the current situation, which has been going on for too long. Yes, the Minsk Group, and lately President Medvedev personally, have invested a lot of effort in order to reach a peaceful agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then why is there deadlock each time both sides meet? In my opinion, the principle of top secrecy of these negotiations is nearly exhausted, and the time has come to drop the position whereby, if both countries cannot agree, we are helpless, since, if a war breaks out, we cannot afford to be bystanders. The European Union should work out a mandate for France and its representative in the Minsk Group and start playing a much more active role, together with the US and Russia, in exerting pressure on both sides for bilateral concessions based on the basic Madrid principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, political and security guarantees should be provided to both sides as requested, in order to pave the way for the development of mutual trust. The EU should also be active in providing incentives regarding infrastructure, economic development and investment so that the people on the ground and the IDPs and refugees coming back feel the benefits of peace once a settlement is reached.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a role for the Union – broadly supported a year ago by this House – would ensure a safer neighbourhood and also provide additional leverage in securing the energy corridors for alternative supply to Europe.</p>

As a result of the attack by the Soviet-Armenian army, Azerbaijan lost 30% of its territory, 20 000 civilians were killed, and almost one million people were stripped of a home. The Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh genocide was one of the gravest, forgotten genocides of the 90s. It is important that the attention of the European Union, otherwise so sensitive to human rights, not be selective, and, when looking at a series of national tragedies, it should not use double standards. As a Hungarian MEP, I would like to reassure the Azeri people that we are following their situation with brotherly love and hope and, at the same time, we call on everybody to exercise self-restraint where Azerbaijan is concerned.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Lady Ashton, today’s debate has been triggered by the growing tension in Nagorno-Karabakh. This trend must be stopped through clear, specific commitments from both sides, as well as through putting an end to the aggressive rhetoric and to the setting of new conditions by both sides, which prevent a consensus being reached on signing a peace agreement. It is also unacceptable for the region’s leaders to use the smouldering conflict to reinforce their internal legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">A peaceful solution must be found to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in accordance with the principles of self-determination, territorial integrity and restraint from the use of force, which are all of equal influence. I am concerned, as other fellow Members have also mentioned, about the continuing flow of arms and the use of offensive military equipment by both sides as well. This poses a threat to the prospect of resolving the conflict and lowers the threshold for the possible use of force, which is not in the interest of either side.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Armenia and Azerbaijan need to make concessions and stop being excessively stubborn, which makes them just like two mules on a bridge, with neither of them wanting to take a step back until finally they both fall off the bridge and drown. What a pity it also is that the only positive message following yet another failed meeting between the two presidents in Kazan is the proviso that they will at least meet again in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The forces in the region must play a constructive role in the negotiating process and in ensuring restraint from the use of force, as well as in strengthening their contacts with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Turkey and Russia must show maturity and abandon the Machiavellian principles so that the conflict can find its own peaceful solution.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Last but not least, Lady Ashton, the European Union, as many of my fellow Members have said, needs to play a greater role in the region.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, prior to the Kazan Summit of 24 June, the international community expressed high hopes that a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be concluded on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, populated for centuries by Christian Armenians and Muslim Azeris who lived intermingled in the South Caucasus, coexisting under different foreign rules. Sadly, no agreement was reached. Instead, all international hope was destroyed, leading to the further frustration of two broken nations and a powerless community to mediate.</p>
      <p sl="en">To avoid further suffering, the EU cannot linger any longer and let other actors in the region, such as Russia, shade the process according to their strategic influence. We have to continue to pressurise and support both countries in a balanced way so that they will adopt the basic principles and we must help these two nations with European aspirations build peace through reconciliation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time to resolve the humanitarian crisis has never been more pressing, so that the hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people can return to their homes in dignity.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as is very clear from this debate, the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has been frozen for a long time, but there is now a serious danger that it could unfreeze and trigger off a major crisis. We know the background: at the end of the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia in 1994, Armenia occupied around a fifth of Azerbaijan’s territory and made about a million people refugees. But there are other actors as well to complicate matters: Russia, Turkey, Iran too; all have interests in this area and could become involved if the Karabakh conflict were to erupt again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, Azerbaijan has used the money from its energy wealth to acquire a major quantity of modern weaponry; Armenia has likewise made military preparations. Last month, as we know, Russia attempted yet another mediation between the two parties in Kazan but this failed. The level of trust between the two antagonists is too low. Now the outcome is frustration in Baku, and frustration can be a bad counsellor, though it is understandable when a sizeable part of one’s territory is under foreign occupation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Azerbaijan’s disappointment at the inaction of the world, and of the West in particular, is further indicated by its recent decision to join the non-aligned movement. Now, an escalation of the conflict – maybe by accident on the ceasefire line – cannot be excluded; that is in no one’s interests and further mediation should be pursued urgently.

We should warn all the parties that any use of force in the present situation could lead to incalculable consequences for the entire region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our responsibility today is to send a very strong signal to all parties – Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia – to refrain from increasing tensions. Russia’s responsibility is significant. It sells or gives arms to both parties and Moscow seems to be interested in a lasting conflict which enables it to increase its grip over the region. I welcome the High Representative’s increased attention to this programme. As she said, the EU has a role to play. But what we especially need today is a convincing commitment from the EU to peace and stability in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until recently, concrete EU incentives for peace have been lacking, but it is crucial for our credibility in this region that we are not only committed, but also consistent in our approach to all interested parties. As a first step, troops should be withdrawn from this region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in October 2010, I had the chance to travel to this region of Nagorno-Karabakh and to meet both the authorities and the refugees. Today, I can only recognise the escalation of violence in this region, as well as a real arms race and the use of warlike rhetoric, particularly on the part of Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As soon as I was back, I called on the Minsk Group to play a more active role and to multiply its efforts to bring the two parties closer together, and it has to be said that particularly with the Kazan Summit, progress has not resulted in a lasting peace. Today, I regret having to acknowledge that President Aliyev’s aggressive rhetoric is only making the situation worse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, may I remind you that the three presidents of the Minsk Group submitted a road map to the G8 in Deauville with, as pointed out by our fellow Members, six basic principles with a view to a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Consequently, it is time to move on to the implementation stage, and I am convinced that without a participation by the representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, a lasting peace will be difficult in this region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With respect to the European Union, it should address the issue and intervene by supporting the diplomatic efforts of the Minsk Group, while also envisaging supporting the civilian population and aid to refugees, in a similar way to what we were able to do for South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008, since our duty is to protect the population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The risks of this conflict exploding are here on Europe’s doorstep and we must tackle this issue. I also call on the Polish Presidency, which has made the eastern partnership a priority of its Presidency, to play a more prominent role in the southern Caucasus.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, as Parliament enters the summer recess, I should like to be completely sure that Nagorno-Karabakh will not experience a similar situation as that which we witnessed in Georgia in the summer of 2008. However, the tense situation and events in the region give me cause for concern. For precisely this reason, it is unfortunate that the decision was made not to adopt a European Parliament resolution on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Hitherto, the European Union has not been sufficiently pro-active in working towards a peaceful resolution to this conflict, even though we have the necessary expertise, resources and experience. Baroness Ashton’s visit to this region may possibly improve the situation. Russia’s role in this region is significant. It continues to provide Armenia with arms, military equipment, and even military training. It is significant that only three days after the last presidential meeting on 24 June in Kazan, President Medvedev signed an agreement to extend the Russian military presence in the region until 2044. It is also significant that weapons are also being supplied to the other side involved in the conflict – to Azerbaijan – and that this is also what other nearby countries are doing. We must take a position in support of the presence of professional and genuinely international peacekeeping forces in the region, which would not consist of just certain countries of the Minsk group, but also of other international forces. I should like to emphasise that Armenia must withdraw its forces from the occupied territories and the surrounding region. At the same time, refugees and former residents of the occupied territories must be given the opportunity to return to their homes. This process must have international observers. Afterwards, it will be possible to organise a referendum regarding the legal status of this region.</p>

As the European Parliament’s rapporteur on Georgia, I recently visited the country and spoke to politicians, those in power, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Head of Parliament, the President and the opposition. They all said that they are absolutely terrified of what may happen in Nagorno-Karabakh.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I shall start from just before the Kazan Summit by reminding you that, if the uprising by the people of Nagorno-Karabakh had taken place today, alongside the uprisings by the Arab nations against tyrannical and unfair regimes, it would certainly have had our undivided support and active backing from the European Community. The same would have happened in Nachitschewan, an area with an identical indigenous population, if that population still existed; unfortunately, it has disappeared. Instead, what we are seeing today is a laboured neutrality towards the situation, with the European Union remaining uninvolved but worried about the source of munitions.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am not saying that we should go and bomb the Caucasus. On the contrary, we need to do everything we can to actively support the peace process, with a visible and substantial EU presence in the Caucasus. On the other hand, for many years, we have watched Azerbaijan, which has been condemned internationally on numerous occasions, especially in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, apply a terrible arms policy. We have watched the Azerbaijan Government spend its huge mineral wealth on arms, instead of fighting for growth and prosperity for the Azeri people.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the other hand, we are, of course, concerned, because now Armenia, a country which has been under an economic embargo for several years, has entered the arms race. A strict embargo has been imposed by all its neighbouring countries. Of course Armenia needs to withdraw from the occupied territories, from the plains of Karabakh, just as Turkey needs to withdraw from Cyprus, but I think that everything needs to be resolved on the basis of law, not on the basis of where everyone buys their munitions.</p>

I experienced the war in Bosnia and what several fellow Members here have spoken about. I sat and waited for someone – the EU, the UN, the United States, NATO – to intervene, drop some bombs or do something in the war, but no one did anything. The frustration that I felt resulted in my involvement in politics. What I am seeing in Nagorno-Karabakh today is a case of déjà-vu. It was exactly the same scenario: people occupied the territory, carried out ethnic cleansing and moved refugees so that there was a majority of their own ethnicity. Then they demand independence and a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I sat and waited for someone to do something, but no one did anything. Today, I will not sit and wait, but demand that the Armenian occupation cease before the refugees are able to return. Only when refugees return and we have a balance can we begin to talk about the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. At some point, we will have to start to discuss it. A referendum cannot be carried out after people have been displaced. The refugees must first go back and then we have to start discussing Nagorno-Karabakh, otherwise we will have another case like Republika Srpska, and we do not want that.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mrs Ibrisagic, as far as I recall, your country recognised Kosovo’s independence. Kosovo was also a territory which broke away from a sovereign state. However, we perceived this as being absolutely the right thing. Yet, at the same time, we condemn what is going on in Nagorno-Karabakh. Do you think that we need to have such double standards? As you mentioned ethnic cleansing, I want to ask you the following: what do you have to say about the ethnic cleansing which the Azeris committed against the Armenians, massacring and deporting every last member of the whole Armenian population of Baku?</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Mr Stoyanov ought to know that Kosovo is internationally recognised as an exceptional case. It has been said that this applies only to Kosovo and nothing else. I believe that the EU should be consistent in how it views similar cases when we talk about South Ossetia and Transnistria. We talk about the territorial integrity of Georgia. We talk about the territorial integrity of Moldova. Why can the EU not be consistent and also protect the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it looks as if Parliament has recently begun a thought process on the frozen war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. For too long, we have buried our heads in the sand, washing our hands of the affair by means of the Minsk Group, and repeating happily that fruitless dialogue lasting 20 years is better than war.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality is that military force continues to be used. The cancer of the world is there and this illness continues to spread when the lands are occupied by foreign forces and when an enemy is not stopped from carrying out sniper killings.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should therefore at least stop kidding ourselves here; ‘to act or not to act’, that is our question. All of our resolutions will be fruitless if they do not concern the realities of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, all expelled people, and all the problems of communication with Nagorno-Karabakh and the Nakhichevan region. We must fully understand what is at stake and have a serious talk with Russia about its role there as actor and stage manager.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the South Caucasus is somewhere that refugees can be met at every turn. This is the truth of the matter; there are refugees in Azerbaijan from Nagorno-Karabakh and in Georgia from Abkhazia or, as has been the case recently, from South Ossetia. Yet I have also seen them in Armenia. They have not come from Nagorno-Karabakh, but from Baku, and they even have their own street, a ‘corner’, which is known as Baku.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem is a complex one and, in my opinion, we must remember that we will not be able to play a positive role in the Caucasus if we take sides in this conflict, or if we come down too much in favour of one of the sides. This is the first matter. The second matter is that Soviet imperialism is the only common denominator for all these conflicts and ethnic cleansings, which are what we should bear in mind first and foremost. This is something that we should not forget. I believe in the Minsk Group’s plan, but I do not believe in the practical implementation of measures by the Minsk Group as it stands. Russia must be a partner in resolving this conflict, since it has interests in the area, but Europe cannot trust Russia to conduct negotiations on this matter, since this will lead to a greater role for Russia, and not to a resolution of the conflict. Baroness Ashton, this is a very important issue from the point of view of your remit this year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Nagorno-Karabakh question is often described as a frozen conflict but this is far from the truth. It is actually thawing very rapidly with an increase in sniper fire at the line of contact, escalating Armenian casualties and the possibility now of a full-scale war breaking out, dragging in Iran and Russia on one side and Turkey on the other. This is extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">The massive flow of petrodollars is now financing a regional arms race, with Baku buying large amounts of big-ticket military items, trebling its defence budget and making increasingly bellicose noises about recapturing NK, and with the much smaller Armenia, with Russian help, desperately trying to catch up.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear to all of those who know the region that Stepanakert will never accept direct Azeri rule, but of course, Armenia must withdraw from the surrounding occupied raions and allow all the IDPs to return. In my view – and I am sorry to contradict Mr Provera who is a great friend – neither self-determination nor territorial integrity are absolute principles. Everybody has to be flexible in foreign policy so we cannot apply them absolutely.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge the Minsk Group now, particularly after the failure at Kazan, to try to resolve this dispute and to redouble their efforts, particularly with the help of the EU Special Representative for frozen conflicts. I would say to Lady Ashton that this is her chance to win a Nobel Peace Prize if she can resolve this one.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the statement made by the High Representative complements the start of the process of reforming the eastern aspect of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Settling unresolved disputes, like those in Transnistria or Nagorno-Karabakh, is one of the priorities of the new policy aimed at providing an area of stability at the EU’s borders. In spite of the ceasefire agreement signed in 1994, tensions are escalating between the parties in the conflict. The negotiations being conducted with the support of the Minsk Group have reached a critical point. The recent Kazan Summit also failed to defuse the tense relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. On the contrary, the response to these negotiations has taken the form of an arms race in the region and a more radical tone being adopted in political speeches.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support a mutually acceptable solution under the aegis of the Minsk Group. I think that a resumption of hostilities seriously jeopardises regional stability as well as European energy security.</p>

Shortly after the collapse of the talks in Kazan, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament came forward, as you know, and announced that a regional conflict of this nature actually should not be resolved by the great powers, but by the players in the region itself, who ‘are so well acquainted with each other’. This, of course, is a highly humorous comment from Tehran.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be reasonably brief because I think so much has been well covered in the contributions which have been made. The first thing to say is that I agree that it is time for me to go to the region. I would already have gone but for the number of issues that I have been dealing with in the recent weeks; however, it was a priority for me to send Miroslav Lajčák to ensure that we were sending the right messages. We are engaged in discussions with the foreign ministers of both parties and with the Chairs of the Minsk Group.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second thing I wanted to say was that we are very happy to play a stronger role. France is very keen to continue in its present role and feels it has much more to contribute, so our role is to support our Member State in its work and to make sure that we are able to offer our contribution as appropriate, and we will continue to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with what has been said by honourable Members that it is important to engage not only with the parties but also in the work we are doing on the ground, and that is why I mentioned earlier the contributions we are trying to make in people-to-people contacts. As honourable Members have said, this is not really a frozen conflict; it is certainly warming up and a conflict which we are right to be extremely concerned about. I agree with what was said about the level of trust being extremely low.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a very timely debate and I thank you for it, because we in the External Action Service are well aware that we need to focus attention on this area and work closely on it with Paris, as well as ensuring that we collaborate with the other members of the Minsk Group. The reason for getting a new Special Representative is also to be able to take this forward with much more vigour and much more effort than we are able to provide with all of the other issues that are currently before us. So thank you again and I look forward to continuing this discussion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">One of the oldest conflicts in the former Soviet region is about to reignite following the failure of the discussions at the end of last month, followed by bellicose statements which have triggered a reminder of the war which, between 1988 and 1994, resulted in more than 30 000 dead and hundreds and thousands of refugees.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is regrettable that the situation has ended up again at the stage of threatening the use of force to settle this unresolved conflict. The pointless dialogue in Kazan between President Aliyev and President Sargsyan highlights the lack of willingness on the part of the Armenian and Azeri leaders to find a solution other than conflict, as well as Russia’s inability to act as an effective mediator.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the EU’s resumption of the role of mediator is the only solution for averting a new war which, in the current climate, would severely destabilise a major strategic region where Russia, Turkey and Iran have overlapping interests.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The first step must be to issue a stern warning stating that the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh cannot result from the use of force, but from negotiations between the parties involved. Revamping the format according to which the Minsk Group of mediators from the OSCE has attempted to operate may help kick-start the dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much again for this agenda item. I think it is important that we take time to reflect on the upcoming Russian elections. May I also thank Parliament for the resolutions on Russia. Your resolution of 9 June on the opening day of our most recent EU-Russia Summit had real impact. Of course, Russia is a partner with whom I work on a large number of foreign policy issues, but today, I want to just focus with you on the upcoming elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think a number of decisions have been taken recently in Moscow which give us some ideas as to what we can expect in December for the Duma elections, and in March 2012 for the presidential poll.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia is already in pre-election mode, with new party alliances and increasing debate. There are some encouraging signs: President Medvedev is calling for economic and political modernisation, and Finance Minister Kudrin insists on free and fair elections. At the same time, political pluralism still faces obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members will be aware, on 22 June, the Russian Ministry of Justice refused to register the new liberal opposition People’s Freedom Party (PARNAS). Parliament here is, of course, fully aware of this case; one of the party’s leaders, Mr Kasyanov, has spoken here several times, and I met briefly with him today in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main reason given for the refusal to register this party was that a few minors, young people and people who were dead had been found among the party’s 46 000 members. Another of the Party’s leaders, Mr Ryzhkov, has rejected these claims as false or groundless. But, even if you exclude those people, he would say that the party would still have the required 45 000 members. Honourable Members know that the earlier political party, the Republican Party of Russia, met a similar fate in 2007, when authorities ordered its dissolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 12 April 2011 this year, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled that this dissolution was in violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. As far as I am aware, the authorities have not yet acted upon this judgment. PARNAS seems to have been denied registration on the basis of this very same and unchanged law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court also noted that minimum party membership requirements in Russia are the highest in Europe. The Court was not persuaded that these requirements are necessary, and stressed that small minority groups must also have an opportunity to participate in elections. It said that frequently changing membership requirements, linked with regular checks, had imposed a disproportionate burden on political parties in Russia. I think that ruling should give the Russian leadership pause for thought.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the EU-Russia Summit, we again emphasised the need for political pluralism. President Medvedev acknowledges that a focus on too much stability results in stagnation. Two weeks ago, he introduced a bill which would lower the threshold for parties to enter the Duma from the current 7% to 5% – but, of course, this only applies to the Duma elections in 2016. We know that the purpose of democratic elections is to give voters a real choice, and a sense that their vote matters for the outcome. Our main contribution is to offer election observation; consultations between Russia and OSCE/ODIHR are ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia seems keen to cooperate, and to avoid a repeat of the situation we saw in 2007, when it did not admit any long-term observers. Long-term observation is important, in particular, to be able to evaluate whether there is fair access to television and other media during the campaign. We received encouraging signals at the summit, and I look forward to a request being sent from Moscow to the OSCE. I am also sure that many honourable Members would be interested in participating in this observation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close with a few remarks about other human rights and rule of law issues in Russia. I believe our Partnership for Modernisation opens new opportunities for cooperation in this field, and I welcome the joint project with the Council of Europe on reforming the appeal system for civil and criminal court cases in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the opening of new forms of dialogue with civil society, in particular, the creation of an EU-Russia Civil Society Forum. Likewise, I welcome President Medvedev’s decision to examine the Khodorkovsky-Lebedev and Magnitsky cases. The conclusions of the Magnitsky case were presented yesterday, while those on the Khodorkovsky and Lebedev cases will take more time. Let me restate that in their cases, the second verdict was disappointing.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, Russia remains an essential partner for the EU and a challenging one. I think there is an interesting debate going on within the country about the modernisation of society and economy, and changing attitudes and expectations will materialise and shape the new realities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The nine months ahead will be very important for Russia’s future development. We believe the democratic process must come from within Russia. We will continue to build our engagement, we will continue to build on our common interests, and we will continue to stand firmly behind our values.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the last plenary session, I pressed for the debate that we are holding today. We do enjoy practical collaboration with Russia, but for us there is one important matter above all others – a fundamental value – and that is democracy. I get the feeling that, at this point in time, the Russian authorities are doing their best more to not permit political parties than to actually put democratisation and modernisation into practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is more, technical requirements can never be, and must never be allowed to be, an obstacle to the freedom of assembly or to establish a political party. In fact, precisely that kind of public debate and political participation by the citizens is something that governments should actually be encouraging. In this connection, I also have a question for Baroness Ashton; namely, have you heard that Boris Nemtsov was today issued with a travel ban by the authorities in Moscow and, if so, what are you going to do about it?</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the name of my group, I call on Russia, which is a member of the Council of Europe, to make adjustments to its disproportionately severe legislation governing the registration of political parties, as the European Court of Human Rights has called for recently in a carefully worded judgment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, there is currently a motion before the Duma that seeks to simply disregard judgments from the European Court of Human Rights. I honestly do not see what advantage Russia envisages gaining by de facto withdrawing from the Council of Europe or simply denying the existence of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My thanks to Baroness Ashton for her efforts. I also thank her for the clear position that she just took. The question for Baroness Ashton and for all of us here is, and remains: how can we ensure that fair and proper elections are held in Russia and how can we ensure that we can actually act as monitors of such elections on the ground?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, because the subject of Russia comes round every four weeks and I stand by the opinion that I expressed four weeks ago. Yes, we regret the fact that yet again, parties in Russia, most recently the liberal party, are not approved and therefore cannot stand for public election. I am convinced that no nation in the world will put up with this in the long term. I am also convinced that our Partnership for Modernisation could be implemented much more effectively if the Russian Government could allay concerns about democratic shortcomings and the rule of law with bold decisions. Until such time as that happens, we shall not let this subject rest, also because we believe that it is in the interest of our partner, in other words, Russia itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">For my part, I should also like to add that I am equally convinced that we can achieve a great deal more by stepping up our talks and our cooperation than by adopting monthly resolutions, however appropriate these may be. Human rights and democracy are indivisible. Our public contribution to this is important, our criticism of Russia is justified, but we would be even more credible if we were to identify the shortcomings within the EU with the same honesty and acuity and perhaps even more unanimously than before. As long as Members of this House maintain – as they did yesterday – that modern Hungary is a model democracy, then, what my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said continues to apply: that the self-righteousness of some Members of this House is hair-raising. I agree with that. I am not saying this to please anyone in Moscow, but because I am firmly convinced that we can make a much more effective contribution than we are making at present.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Russian Minister of Justice has consistently refused to register any new political parties since February 2009; the most recent being the People’s Freedom Party, whose two leaders are among us today in the gallery: Mr Mikhail Kasyanov and Mr Boris Nemtsov.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madam High Representative, the future of EU-Russia strategic relations must be directly linked to efforts to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights in Russia. The Kremlin is breaching Russia’s commitments as a Member of the Council of Europe and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights and therefore ought to be disciplined if the requirements for political pluralism continue to be disregarded.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, the Russian authorities continue to pressure the opposition. Yesterday, for example, the authorities issued a six-month exit ban for Mr Boris Nemtsov, one of the leaders of the party PARNAS.</p>
      <p sl="de">I recall that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe holds the right to withhold verification of the credentials of parliamentarians elected through elections deemed to be in breach with European standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union must also insist that the Kremlin withdraws all decisions and regulations concerning the non-registration of political parties in Russia that do not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Putin has got until September to reconsider, when the elections are announced, but we can already see that the tracks have been laid.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the December elections to the Duma will point the way for developments over the next few years in our largest continental neighbour. Will we see restricted democracy, or even creeping authoritarianism? Unfortunately, we are under no illusions. All the facts point to a slow drift towards an autocracy ruled by the pro-Kremlin ‘United Russia’ party. Examples of what I have in mind include amendments made by the government to the electoral law increasing the electoral threshold to 7%, a stepping up of attacks and blackmail against opposition activists, the absence of pluralism in the media and a refusal to register political parties. This is a clear indication of the path the Kremlin has chosen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The escalation of such measures should be linked to the results of opinion polls published by the independent Russian media, which show that there is less and less support for the actions of those in power. In view of these facts, what should we do? Above all, we should endeavour to obtain the release of opposition activists and politicians. We must respond in a spirit of solidarity to all violations of human rights, paying particular attention to attacks on the free press, and support the development of free speech by inviting Russian journalists to participate in the European debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will once again be adopting a resolution on Russia. It will, in fact, be the fourth resolution on Russia this year, which is a clear indication of the backlog of problems and the difficulties in communication that have built up between the European Union and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our most recent resolution expressed our concerns and expectations in respect of the forthcoming Duma and presidential elections in Russia. Baroness Ashton, I can only hope that, together with Presidents Barroso and Van Rompuy, you addressed this very clearly in your talks with President Medvedev in Nizhny Novgorod. Yet what effect has that had? What has happened since then? By failing to allow the liberal PARNAS party, the Russian Government has demonstrated that it is clearly hell-bent on backing up its ‘controlled’ democracy and ‘controlled’ justice with ‘controlled’ elections. Even President Medvedev – and you stressed this yourself – has called for competition between political parties, as he has recognised that a governing party without competition will stagnate and then lead the country into stagnation.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is thus in Russia’s own interest for us not to let the Russian Government get away with infringing international obligations, as Russia is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, all of which should actually guarantee that it complies with all the generally recognised electoral standards. Only in April – and you pointed this out, too – the European Court of Human Rights found that the disbanding of the Republican Party was disproportionate and unlawful and called on Russia to follow up as necessary by 12 July.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the only possible follow-up is for these electoral obstacles to finally be removed and the way cleared for free, real, fair and proper elections. Russia repeatedly demands freedom of travel within the EU, yet freedom of travel without free elections at home is a hamstrung and restricted freedom and leads to emigration rather than modernisation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In connection with the Russian elections to be held on 4 December, I would definitely like to emphasise the importance of creating the status of a European Union election observer. I, myself – at the invitation of the ‘Civil Control’ social organisation – participated at the regional elections as an observer in March of this year. On this occasion, I was able to speak with Viktor Churov, the President of the Russian Election Committee, who informed me that currently, there is no agreement between the two countries about sending election observers. This is why I find it particularly important that OSCE negotiations be concluded successfully, and that representatives of the European Parliament also be able to participate officially in Russian elections. This is what I ask of Mr Fleckenstein, Chair of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, that in September, at the next committee meeting in Warsaw, we definitely raise this issue with the Russian negotiation partner.</p>

The Russian decision to block the registration of a credible political party prior to the elections is not an aberration; it is yet another example of Russia’s refusal to play by the rules while claiming to be a genuinely democratic post-Soviet entity.</p>
      <p sl="en">But politically motivated killings, kidnappings and jailings, sanctioned by a corrupt justice system or ignored by the judicial authorities, are a common feature of the Russian democracy. Indeed, one can say that the Russian authorities perfected democracy to the point where opposition is not necessary any more and the voters are no longer essential. But if Russia is not willing to be honest with its own people, we should not expect honesty in Russia’s relations with the EU. It might take one to kozachok, but it surely takes two to tango.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I call on you and the Commission to make any further negotiations with Russia conditional on the fair preparation and conduct of the elections in December. Human rights and democracy should be at the centre of our relationship with Russia, and if we are ready to reset our relations with Russia, then Russia should reset its own relations with democracy.</p>

I have to tell the Commissioner that literally 90 minutes ago, in a room 100 metres away from the plenary chamber, the delegation for relations with Russia turned down an opportunity to vote through and adopt a statement on the Magnitsky affair, and rejected the stated intention of clarifying the cause of his death as quickly as possible and of punishing the culprits. It should be noted that the delegation did so in response to a motion to block the statement tabled by Mr Schulz, who has spoken so eloquently and genuinely about the problems of Russian democracy. Even hypocrisy has its limits. On the one hand, we talk about how we want to promote democracy in Russia while, on the other, we block the clarification of matters that are fundamental to this democracy, such as the death of Mr Magnitsky.</p>

We absolutely did not reject the substance of your statement on Mr Magnitsky. All we said was that it is very much out-of-date. You wrote it four weeks ago. The Fedotov report has now been published, and it sets out the details and circumstances of Mr Magnitsky’s death very clearly. We needed to take that on board. Your statement needs to be revised. However, our opinions on the case are the same. I wish to distance myself from this hypocrisy. What you have said in this connection is outrageous. It is defamatory to say what you have said.

However, I can tell Mr Schulz that four weeks ago, when he received the previous version of the statement on the Magnitsky affair, he said back then that he did not wish to comment on the matter, and he believed back then that we should not vote on it, since he did not wish to put his name to it. I would therefore ask him not to start trying now to justify what I believe is a hypocritical position. I will not retract my statement, although it may not be to his liking.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, if the Russian Federation wants to be a respected partner of Europe, it must abandon the totalitarian practices by means of which it is now eliminating the opposition, including the earlier exclusion of the PARNAS party from the elections.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I used to live in the former Eastern Bloc, and I am therefore very familiar with the path Russia is gradually treading from totalitarianism via an authoritarian system to democracy. The current government, however, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice, is systemically changing the electoral rules and frustrating free competition between political ideas. This proves, unfortunately, that the government is only pretending to build a democratic Russia. President Medvedev, in particular, is tightening the reins again.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Baroness Ashton, I hope you will continue to insist on compliance with human rights in the Russian Federation, and on ending those practices which will otherwise become a barrier to cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership policy. I firmly believe that these practices are intended to secure one-party government indefinitely, as a fellow Member said here earlier. I am concerned, despite everything, that the autumn elections to the Duma will not be declared to have been free.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would therefore like to ask a question in advance, if I may. What measures are you planning to take, Baroness Ashton, on behalf of the EU? What can we do now to avoid or at least minimise such a situation? Current events in Russia show that Russia is actually moving more towards an authoritarian system than towards democracy. That is bad for Europe as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">You can use it or you can lose it. I completely agree with the previous speaker in what she said and I will not repeat it. I just wanted to draw your attention to one very important aspect we did not achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before the elections, Russia needs long-term election observation – not just for a few days in election time – but long term. This is because the people have very limited access to the mass media. We have listened to representatives of the new party, PARNAS. They told us this situation is very unequal. This is a very important issue for our common future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it is clear that the Russian leadership in the Kremlin is not enamoured with serious opposition, which explains its non-registration of PARNAS on very dubious grounds. I read an interesting interview with one of the party’s joint chairs, Mikhail Kasyanov, the former Prime Minister of Russia, about the motives behind this decision. He expects us to send a signal. We are doing so with this debate and tomorrow, we will also do so with the resolution. I am firmly behind it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the meantime, we can talk of an unhappy continuity in Russian history. Four years ago, you had to vote for a particular party, namely Mr Putin’s and Mr Medvedev’s party. It is now 2011, and this situation is repeating itself. The Pan-Russian Popular Front has recently been established. Unbelievable as it is, every possible association is being included without the members knowing anything about it. A member of the architects’ association has just discovered this fact and protested about it. Mr Putin is to investigate the matter. It is absolutely obvious that we need to make clear to our Russian partner that political pluralism is political pluralism and nothing else, even in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Russia is one of the European Union’s most important partners, a partner which, through its economic power and growing economic potential, will soon be having a greater impact on life in Europe. It is therefore surely important for us that political power in that country should reflect the plurality of opinions held by the citizens of that country. On the other hand, to expect that any world power – be it the US, Russia or China – would allow itself to be dictated to by us regarding the rules it should apply when organising its parliamentary elections is, in my opinion, a sign of over-confidence on our part. Like the authors of this resolution, I, too, sincerely hope that not just the December elections to the Russian Duma, but all elections organised in Russia, are honest, transparent and fair, but I am not sure we should send a message like this to a partner with whom we say we enjoy good relations. I firmly believe that Baroness Ashton has sufficient authority in Moscow to convey our concerns in a more diplomatic and sensitive manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you again. I found that a very interesting and stimulating debate. As we think about how to address some of the areas of concern that honourable Members have quite rightly raised, I just want to make three very straightforward points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we have to continue to articulate our expectations to Russia as far as free and fair elections are concerned, and we will recall the international commitments that Russia has taken in this regard. I think it is very important as we move towards the elections that we continue to send that strong message: that we want to see these elections be fair and free; that we want to see the international commitments fully followed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we want as well to offer our election observation. I said earlier that consultations between Russia and OSCE/ODIHR are ongoing; they seem keen to cooperate. I hope that will happen and that this will also help in the light of some of the comments that honourable Members have made about the need to look at the long-term nature of observation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we also need, and again Members made this clear, to make sure that at the level of the modernisation partnership, we are working closely to help support that process. We currently have 16 bilateral partnerships, and these look at issues like foreign investment, know-how and technology, as well as the rule of law of modern democratic institutions and civil society involvement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because I think it is also clear from what honourable Members have said that we want to send a very clear message to the people of Russia that we are a supportive friend, that we want to see progress, we want to see modernisation and we want also to be a source of inspiration when it comes to the democratic values we hold and our absolute passion for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the statement made by the High Representative at such an important time for every democracy in the world. I think that a real partnership between the EU and Russia must be based not only on common interests but also on sharing principles and values. These must include respect for the rule of law and for fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital that, in the run-up to and during the elections in December 2011, Russia lives up to expectations in terms of respect for democratic standards. Political pluralism is a definitive feature of modern societies. The organisation of free and fair elections ensures the expression of a variety of opinions, visions and options. This will allow the Russian authorities to make a significant contribution not only to strengthening the democratic nature of the state, but also to offering a viable model for neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">The ability and willingness to provide an environment for free elections is a cornerstone of the democratic functioning of any country. The refusal to register the PARNAS party for the elections must be taken very seriously. This is a clear signal that Russia is not willing to allow free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, Russia is mocking democracy. The case of Khodorkovsky is no longer that of one individual, but has become a grotesque symbol of the entire Russian judiciary system and the situation of the rule of law in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU cannot continue treating Russia on a case-by-case basis. It is unacceptable for the EU to allow Russia to dictate the agenda, as recently seen at the EU-Russia Summit that was dominated by the marginal issue of vegetable imports and exports, rather than Russia’s serious violations of the rule of law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to be clear that, if there is no change in Russia, the EU will not continue talks on anything with its so-called strategic partner. There can be no talks on the new PCA unless Russia takes concrete action to improve the judiciary system and to apply the rule of law and democratic principles.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are seeing a great many alarming developments in the run-up to the forthcoming elections to the Duma, such as the refusal to register the PARNAS party and the increase in the electoral threshold. These developments, coupled with examples where freedom of speech has been disregarded and representatives of the press and media have been attacked, both of which are already regular occurrences in Russia, have given rise to widespread alarm. Russia should change its policies on the opposition and the free press. In particular, I support the call to lift the ban on leaving the country imposed on the opposition activist, Boris Nemtsov. The Russians should understand that respect for democratic standards is essential in order to improve relations between Russia and the rest of the world. Despite the fact that Russia is one of the European Union’s largest and most significant partners, and despite the fact that it is assuming a more important role on the international stage, the European Union should continue to implement measures aimed at changing the situation in this country. I am counting on Baroness Ashton’s future actions yielding better results. In the longer term, we should take concrete steps to encourage Russia to change its policies. I also hope that the forthcoming observation mission will have a positive impact on the course of the elections.</p>

      <p sl="en">It looks as though financial oligarchic groups are lobbying with the intention of reshaping the existing political and economic balance in the Russian Federation, rather than changing the legal situation. In hearings and discussions, we should hear not only the opinion of opposition representatives from outside parliament, but also official Russian opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to emphasise that many of the former high-ranking Russian officials who chose to leave the so-called political elite did not make any changes to the legislation and constitution of the Russian Federation when they had the chance.

      <p sl="ro">Last month, we emphasised in point 12 of the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit the need for free and fair elections by implementing the standards set out by the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Here we are again obliged to return to this subject, against a background where the PARNAS party has been deprived of the right to take part in the forthcoming parliamentary elections. This is an unfortunate decision. Some of the registration procedures used in Russia for political parties and candidate lists have proved to be unjustified. They have become an impediment to free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital for the credibility of these elections in December that the Russian authorities allow the OSCE/Council of Europe to carry out some long-term election monitoring missions.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very important subject, so we have a prepared statement in which we would like clearly to announce that free movement is a defining principle of the European Union. It is one of the most tangible and successful achievements of the European project. An area without internal border controls is central to the success of the Single Market and Europe’s continued efforts to boost growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must ensure that the reintroduction of internal border controls by Member States does not erode the freedom of movement and impede the realisation of the European Union’s greatest achievements. Attacking free movement jeopardises the internal market, solidarity among Europeans and, ultimately, the European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council agreed that there is a need for an EU-based mechanism to respond to exceptional circumstances which might put at risk the overall functioning of Schengen cooperation. We are studying this idea, but let me be very clear: any such mechanism would need to operate in a way which does not endanger the principle of the free movement of persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beyond such a mechanism, a series of measures could be envisaged at EU level to assist a Member State facing heavy pressure at the external borders. These would include inspection visits and technical and financial support, including the participation of Frontex. The Commission is looking into how these support measures can be put forward. In the framework of this EU-based mechanism, a safeguard clause could be envisaged as a very last resort, allowing the exceptional reintroduction of internal border controls in a truly critical situation for a strictly limited period, geographically limited, and for a minimal period of time where a Member State fails to fulfil its obligations under Schengen rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union works on the basis of mutual trust, solidarity and responsibility. As such, establishing a coordinated, EU-based response would allow all European interests to be taken into account and limit unilateral initiatives by Member States to reintroduce internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission intends to take up the invitation from the European Council to submit a proposal for such a mechanism together with the updated proposal on the Schengen evaluation in September. Given the crucial importance of free movement for the EU and its future, the Commission strongly believes that the proposal for the mechanism should be based on Article 77 of the TFEU. In this way, proposals will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, thus ensuring the full involvement of Parliament, on an equal footing with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word on the topical issue of controls at the Danish borders. The Commission has conveyed to Denmark its grave concerns concerning the respect of Treaty freedoms and of the Schengen acquis. Since then, intensive and constructive contacts between the Commission services and Denmark have been taking place on a daily basis and at different levels. We will assess in detail the recent measures introduced by the Danish authorities. Indeed, the Commission needs to know how the Danish authorities will conduct checks at the border so that it can assess whether they are in compliance with the EU rules on free movement of goods, services and persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the free movement of people, goods and services is a central piece of the European construction and is guaranteed by the Treaties that Member States have ratified. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will do its utmost to ensure that this is respected all over Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the Commission declaration, which is in line with Parliament’s recommendation. I should like to stress the fact that the Commissioner has told us that the Commission views Schengen as one of the most important achievements of European integration. Schengen represents freedom of movement, but Schengen also means more security, with the reinforcement of the external borders, with police, customs and judicial cooperation, and with the creation of the Schengen Information System and the common visa policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Schengen presupposes mutual trust among the Member States of the Schengen area because their security depends on how thoroughly and effectively each Member State controls its borders. Schengen also presupposes solidarity and – let us be honest – solidarity has not been evident in the way we have reacted to the flow of migrants from North Africa, which has been putting the issues of receiving and hosting under great pressure in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I acknowledge that we are going through a difficult period, but in no way can this serve as an excuse for weakening the great achievement that is Schengen. Schengen is synonymous with freedom, and this reality cannot and must not be perverted or diminished, but rather must be protected, strengthened and developed. Seeking to unilaterally reintroduce border controls as an easy solution is a concession to populism and a threat to the common heritage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With this resolution, Parliament is sending a strong message, whilst stressing the need for the Member States to respect and implement the Schengen rules properly, and demanding greater solidarity and sharing of responsibilities. It is also demanding an increase in the powers and resources of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), as well as a real evaluation mechanism for Schengen that checks compliance with the rules and external border controls, and, as a last resort, penalises Member States if they do not comply.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Madam President, I note the Commission’s encouraging words, but I regret the Council’s absence. The adoption of this resolution is also a test of the Council’s credibility. The Council must prove that it is also prepared to work honestly with Parliament on the Schengen evaluation mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, we all know that we are discussing an initiative to change Schengen because there has been a migratory flow from North Africa as a consequence of the democratic movements that have taken place there. That is a context in which talk of changing Schengen must inevitably be seen as sending out the wrong signal, in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, in the time I have available, I wish to reaffirm that the work of this Parliament should lie first in ensuring that there is no question of reducing or cutting back on Schengen, but rather of reinforcing it. Secondly, the problem in Europe is not one of re-establishing internal borders but rather of ensuring the common management of external borders, which is what the Treaty of Lisbon requires. Thirdly, the work of this Parliament should complete the asylum package and the migration package and, together with the Council, give meaning to the solidarity clause within the EU, which is also contemplated in the Treaty of Lisbon. Furthermore, of course, we must ensure the full involvement and participation of Parliament, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure envisaged by Article 77 of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="es">That will be the best way of honouring the area of freedom, security and justice and the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon, and of ensuring that we do not take even one step back in guaranteeing and improving the free movement of persons.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, over the last few months, the European Union has been confronted with several challenges. As if the economic crisis and the efforts to overcome it were not enough, some Member States have added another sensitive point to the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead of welcoming the switch to democratic regimes in some countries in northern Africa, and instead of putting more energy and imagination into assisting the peoples there, a couple of governments – ironically, EU founder-members – afraid that 25 000 people entering the EU would affect their stability, considered that the best way to protect their own borders would be to close them. They had the idea that a new mechanism, profoundly affecting the Schengen area and free movement, should be allowed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Other governments consider that reinstating border controls is an efficient way to fight organised crime, as if criminals follow rules. The ALDE Group has been very firm and vocal from the very beginning. We do not want – and we will not accept – any new mechanism that may affect the Schengen acquis, the very spirit of EU integration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, we are ready and have already started working towards better Schengen governance for better protection of the EU external borders – while fully respecting the human rights of those trying to reach them – and towards full implementation of the principle of solidarity among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Politicians who believe that European citizens will like them as a result of this initiative are very wrong. They may get some votes in their own countries in the next elections as politicians, but they will not be forgiven for not acting as great statesmen in the interest of all European citizens, including their own. Only the preservation of Schengen and its acquis is a win-win situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this House has had many debates lately on how the Union deals with the pressures of migration and borders and we welcome another opportunity to expand the discussion. These discussions are long overdue, and so is reform of the Schengen system. Providing free movement is no longer the only issue that Schengen has to face. Twenty-six years has heralded change, growth and, unfortunately, some new and very big problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The world is changing, Europe is changing, and the Union’s response to new challenges needs to change too. Events in North Africa, increased migration, increased trafficking of drugs and people, unemployment, organised crime and terrorism are all issues that need to be addressed by a new and improved Schengen system. I hope that the response which the European Union delivers is one that is thoughtful and measured and not just over-speedy or reactionary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The system should be made better and serve the people of Europe better. Member States need clear and strong support from the agencies of the EU – like Frontex, Europol and Eurojust – and there needs to be a strengthened evaluation mechanism for Member States who join the Schengen area, including a much greater focus on the prevention of corruption, the combating of organised crime and the establishment of independent judiciaries. We need to seriously consider the benefits of an evaluation mechanism which includes a support regime as well as a sanctions regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States need more say regarding their own borders, not less. Member States and the European Union should be partners, not master and slave. We must listen to Member States and listen to the needs of European citizens. Whilst doing so, we must always protect fundamental rights and freedoms.

If the Member States of the European Union do not get their way on the introduction of new controls on internal borders, they change the legal basis. That seems to me to be a very immature way to be cooperating and to be solving a problem. The only option left to us is to make clear to the Member States in question that, if they do that, we will turn to the courts and that the European Parliament will not allow a different legal basis to be created just like that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why are these Member States doing this? Do we believe that the danger comes from outside? Do we believe that we need to keep out these people, who only want to live in liberty, because they are a danger? The economic crisis does not derive from North Africa.

      <p sl="fr">Let us stop scaremongering with a few tens of thousands of Tunisians. Let us stop lumping everything together, and let us talk about the dozens of men and women locked up in detention centres at Europe’s borders, on either side of its borders. Dozens of them are being sent back to their country of origin, without even having been able to use their right of asylum. Others are being denied the right to live with their families. Where are the fundamental rights of these men, women and children? What about their freedom of movement? What about the solidarity between countries of the Union and third countries, when we make partnership agreements dependent on the readmission of their nationals? How can we let dozens of people die in the Mediterranean without doing everything in our power to save these human lives?</p>

      <p sl="it">With these scenes in North Africa, do we want to disregard the possibility that there can be an emergency two times, 10 times, God forbid, one hundred times greater? A great French author, Jean Raspail, had predicted it many decades ago, and today we are very close to this situation. So let us give it proper consideration before criminalising a small liberal country such as Denmark, which decides to defend its own borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am prepared to praise borders, and we should not criminalise the existence of borders. When controls are needed and when a country considers prioritising the safety of its citizens, it is necessary to respect that decision and that should be democracy according to the rules shared by all European countries. Thus let us pay great attention to and let us reflect with great concern on the danger of a biblical exodus from Africa. This danger exists and is very close, very close indeed …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the fine country of Denmark for its excellent decision to reintroduce border controls. It demonstrates the decisiveness of a sovereign state, within a constantly meddling European Union, that is unwilling to accept that a foreign pseudo-power should dictate what dangers its citizens are confronted with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Crime crosses borders. The idea of combating it by means of removing borders is an illusion. In reality, removing borders brings about an unchecked spread where crime from eastern European Member States floods into the rich states of western Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The reintroduction of border controls is an effective way for a sovereign state to prevent undesirable elements from penetrating its national borders. A sovereign state has an obligation to itself to stand up, at all times, for the interests of its own people as best it can. A government that neglects its own people to the benefit of bandits and scroungers denies its own history and renounces the interests of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If countries want to introduce effective border controls, that must be up to them to decide. Eurocrats currently prohibit effective border controls. Dutch customs officials are thus bound to check only two incoming trains a day per route, and only two train sets per train.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Naturally enough, the enthusiasm for freedom of movement is falling steadily in the Member States. Give our customs officials and military police the scope to carry out checks as they want to, based on years of experience, empirical research and their sense of the urgency of each case.</p>

One of them is of mixed Dutch-Turkish origin, the other of Dutch-Surinamese origin. They both have coloured skin, to a degree, and they have both been asked for their passport several times. They were also told by the military police that they left those carriages that contain only blonde people unchecked and sought out those carriages containing people who, like me, are not blonde.

      <p sl="nl">I do not know about the specific cases you mention, but I certainly do not approve. I agree with you entirely in that regard, but the problem is precisely that there is such a limitation in place. If the whole train were checked, this problem simply would not arise.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, the European Council met. After the summit, the Heads of State or Government appeared before the media and told the citizens of Europe how proud they were of Schengen and that they would defend Schengen against the attacks on it. When I heard these statements from our leading EU politicians, I thought to myself, ‘how bad have things got that it is now viewed as a success to defend Schengen?’ Schengen was a given that we had created in Europe, yet suddenly it is up for discussion again.</p>
      <p sl="de">The key question is how can we deal with the popularism we can sense on the Right? I think we need to take a two-pronged approach. The first element is that we need to convince people again that the project is right. We need to answer the assertion that security is improved through the introduction of border controls by explaining that it was only with the introduction of the Schengen Information System, through partnership and cooperation, that security was improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">I live in the border area between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In my area, security has improved since border controls were abolished, as we now work with the Czech authorities. Even before abolishing the border controls, we have had more success in fighting crime in Romania and Bulgaria simply thanks to the exchange of information within the framework of the Schengen Information System. We need to convince people and win them back to the project. We need to win their hearts and I would like to see the Commission do more in this regard. Commissioner Malmström yesterday went on record saying that there had not been any problems so far in Denmark. While she may have been legally accurate, she offered too little political argument. We are not fighting for the hearts and minds of the people at this point in the way we should be.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament, we can reassure the citizens that we take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously. We shall defend the Schengen agreement against all attacks that it may face with all the power we have as MEPs. If the Schengen acquis is to be amended, we shall ensure that it emerges from the changes stronger rather than weaker.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at the outset, the Commissioner started to say the positive things we wanted to hear, but the pre-emptive strike contained in this resolution is here for a reason. The reason is that we, in wanting to convince the people of the value of Schengen – the genuine value of Schengen, the economic value of Schengen, the social value of Schengen – have to make that case. But we have to do that from this Parliament, not on the sidelines of consultation, but in the centre of the situation, with codecision. So, first of all, regarding Article 77, this is something we ask for and we expect to see from the Commission in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Socialists and Democrats are clear that we will work and vote with colleagues across this House who believe in the value of Schengen. Our group is saying very clearly that manipulation of Schengen comes at the greatest social and economic cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">To the Council, we say that the flexibility already exists for Member States to alter the Schengen rules. It already exists, so we want a mechanism which provides safeguards and makes the Member States think twice if they want to abuse the rules that they themselves have put together.</p>
      <p sl="en">We say clearly that we will oppose any new Schengen mechanism that has any other objective than enhancing freedom of movement and reinforcing EU governance of the Schengen area. We say to the Commission: do your job as guardian of the Treaties and provide the clear oversight which will make those Member States think twice about inflicting damage on a key freedom that our citizens enjoy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bigger picture is vital. There is a problem with the external border. Not since Tampere have we made rules on asylum and immigration, a fact that is now putting Schengen and the Schengen area under pressure. That is happening; it happened in Italy and France.</p>
      <p sl="en">But what is at stake here, if the Commission does not get it right, is that you will irretrievably damage the Schengen area, which would then irretrievably damage one of the most positive and tangible benefits of the European Union. Our group will take the higher ground with all other colleagues in this Chamber and remain firm in the defence of Schengen.</p>

Therefore, only real threats could be a reason for the reintroduction of border checks, as a last resort. Such threats must be immediate, not merely hypothetical.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the procedure, it should be European in nature. By the Schengen Borders Code, the EU has exercised its competence concerning the reintroduction of border checks. This means that the Member States cannot legislate on it any more. Also, we deplore the fact that the current procedure is de facto unilateral; this matter is already within the framework of EU law, not national law. Therefore, Commissioner, we suggest that the Commission takes one step further and proposes a mechanism whereby the European Union institutions will decide on the reintroduction of border checks.</p>

This is a dire warning for the entire European Union. We all know that the Schengen agreement does indeed allow for temporary border controls to be introduced in special circumstances, as we saw with the football World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Schengen system does not need any additional mechanism. If the Danish Government re-introduces permanent controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, that constitutes an infringement of the agreement. I expect nothing less from the Commission than to treat this as what it is – an infringement of the agreement. This genie must be re-bottled, as freedom and freedom of movement are not up for negotiation; they are fundamental values that shape the European Union. They cannot be sacrificed to national vanities and the extreme Right.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it is a deeply worrying fact that external border controls in the European Union are back on the agenda. For years, efforts have been made to ensure that new generations grow up with the idea and older generations get used to the idea that there are no internal borders in Europe. It is unacceptable, in my opinion, to use the waves of immigrants from North Africa – and soon we may have the same from Syria – as an excuse for reintroducing control zones within unified Europe, especially, in many instances, under pressure of public opinion in various countries. What will the next step be? In other words, if someone raises the question of the restoration of customs controls, will we open a debate on it in Europe? Are we at that point at this moment in time?</p>
      <p sl="el">We do not want to turn the clock back thirty years, when people sitting on these benches, on the benches we are sitting on today, debated a Europe without borders, without passports, without controls, a truly united continent, with the provision that controls could be restored in exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="el">So what is the point of a debate on the imposition of new border controls when we have the provision in Articles 23 and 26 of the Schengen Borders Code. What is the point, at top-level debate, of omitting all reference to the role which the Treaty of Lisbon itself vests in the European Parliament as colegislator on border control issues?</p>
      <p sl="el">These issues have been resolved and answered. What we want today is to strengthen Schengen, to safeguard freedom of movement and to improve cooperation between the Member States. What we need is a revised Dublin II and strict and permanent border controls, especially in the south. We need to strengthen Frontex and, for the time being of course, as long as this debate continues, we need to provide an immediate answer to the question of exactly who has the right to decide to restore controls and under exactly what circumstances border controls will be restored with the new debate under way.</p>

It also has a symbolic meaning, and for many people, it is the most visible sign of the existence of the European Union. The effective functioning of the European Union requires trust, and to maintain this trust, we must find solutions that are adequate and treat the real causes of problems. Introducing unilateral border controls is not one of these solutions. The appropriate answer to the wave of migration is strengthening external borders and drawing up a common migration and refugee policy. Furthermore, the Schengen cooperation definitely supports the fight against crime. The temporary reinstatement of border controls can be accepted only with a Community decision; the regulation thereof can only take place pursuant to Article 77 of the agreement, within the framework of a codecision procedure with the full involvement of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to insist on four points that seem essential to me in today’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To start with, the changes that we will bring to Schengen will have to fully respect the European spirit in which this Community acquis was devised and conceived. This is not about reorganising Schengen in order to weaken it, but rather to strengthen it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, this debate is putting the following question to us: are we convinced about defending the interests of all European citizens or are we submitting to the will of the Member States?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a way, this is a test of ‘Europeanness’ and I am among those who prefer to keep these precious acquis, rather than letting them be overrun by short-sighted national interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This brings me to my second point. Strengthening Schengen can only be done by amending the assessment mechanism in an intelligent and balanced way. Its current shortcomings are known; we need to rethink it so as to ensure, at the same time, free movement of persons, mutual trust between Member States and everyone’s safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sanctions and the possibility of reintroducing temporary border controls should only be envisaged as a last resort, but they must be there, since without any safeguard, there is no point in doing assessments which are then consigned to oblivion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I believe that the balanced position we will have to adopt should entail recognising that retaliation measures are necessary, albeit in a very strict framework, that of the assessment mechanism controlled by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now come to my third point. If we decide to introduce the possibility of sanctions and temporary border controls, then the criteria will have to be very specific and set in advance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I wish to point out that Parliament has always defended its rights, and that it will not tolerate Member States calling into question the legal basis on which the Schengen assessment mechanism is founded. We will be uncompromising, as we have been several times when the Council decided to bypass the codecision procedure.</p>

Despite all the verbal precautions used, it is clear for everyone to see how much this looks like the start of the dismantling of the free movement of persons in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For that matter, some statements are unmistakable, such as the one that justifies this new mechanism as necessary, and I quote ‘in order to restrict freedom of movement’. Do we need to point out the blatant contradiction between this solution and the political opportunism that it reflects? Let us reiterate once again that safeguard mechanisms are already in place and that they have been used several times already; there is no need to create a new one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, what should alert us with the calling into question of what is a founding and historical acquis of European integration is the fact that it is symptomatic of looking inwards and of rejecting solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a coincidence if free movement is being attacked today; it is a new symptom of the crumbling of European cohesion and of the nationalistic scourge gaining ground.

Therefore, the natural response of the Council and the Commission ought to be to further improve the system of free movement. An example of this could be the evaluation system that is now being discussed in the Committee on Civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which could make it easier to decide whether Member States are contravening the rules. Instead, the Commission communication on migration of 4 May contained a whole series of bad proposals. One of the things discussed was to change the rules concerning temporary border controls. There is already the possibility of doing this under special circumstances. The proposal for additional changes is simply a flirt with the far-right extremists. The limited influx of migrants to Europe following the events in North Africa should never be an excuse for restricting free movement within the EU.

We cannot accept that the number of situations currently described as being exceptional should increase due to a new mechanism as we would be giving governments with nationalist and populist overtones the opportunity to use this mechanism to promote their anti-EU policies.

The problem does not lie with the new mechanism, but with the successful implementation of the Schengen agreement and Member States’ desire to comply with it.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Schengen reform seems, at the moment, to be more of a political intrigue than about ensuring the protection of the area of free movement and strengthening it.

There was no way, otherwise, of us arriving at the Danish decision, made under populist pressure.</p>
      <p sl="bg">What will the evaluation criteria be? How will we create an accurate indicator for measuring corruption and the fight against crime?

      <p sl="sl">At the time, these countries shared the ambition of wanting to connect and integrate with each other. However, there are now some Member States, Denmark in particular, that are destroying what was a dream of many Europeans at the time. Currently, the Schengen system is in no need of change. We cannot allow the reintroduction of border controls. If this system has shortcomings, let us rectify them. However, some governments that are threatening to reintroduce border controls and that are calling for new rules are sending out the message that they do not need Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We cannot allow millions of Europeans to become an instrument of populist policies. Freedom of movement has been one of the ideals of European politicians for decades, which is why we expect the European Commission and the Member States to support this in the autumn and listen to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Our citizens will be greatly disappointed if we find we have celebrated a Europe without borders that only actually existed for a few short years. Afterwards, there will not be much left. I fear that our Europe will then collapse as suddenly as a house of cards.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I believe that what is going on at the moment with internal border controls is unacceptable. Schengen’s credibility is being undermined by the fact that the European Union does not have a mechanism which should be triggered if a Member State fails to meet its responsibilities properly with regard to the Union’s external border. The solution is to change the intergovernmental approach into a mechanism coordinated at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Where problems are created at external borders, measures must be taken to support the relevant Member States, especially through the intervention of Frontex. Reintroducing controls must be used as a last resort, and only if the Member State is unable to remedy the shortcoming within six months, even after providing support. In this instance, I believe that it is fair to draw up measures providing financial compensation to support Member States affected by the reintroduction of internal border controls. Such a mechanism would avoid the situations where a Member State introduces controls at its borders unilaterally.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, we cannot adapt rules at will. EU endorsement of the introduction of customs controls at Denmark’s borders with Germany and Sweden could have a direct impact on the entire Schengen system. If every State claimed the right to introduce similar controls, the Schengen agreement on freedom of movement would become meaningless. We therefore need to introduce equivalent rules in the area of migration that are valid for all countries of the European Union and that define precisely the circumstances under which the ‘Schengen’ borders may be closed. I fear that Denmark has opened a Pandora’s Box. On the one side are the Member States, which fear an increase in illegal migration and international crime following the conflict in Africa, and on the other side are the migrants, whose right to freedom of movement we may regard as being under threat. I would like to suggest, however, that we address the current problem at this time, which is still the EU’s lack of preparedness for crisis situations and the consequences of these situations, which are now confronting more than one Member State.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, welcome to your chair.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is this idea of reintroducing internal Schengen borders because of migratory flows. This is not a good idea. If you want to control migratory flows, you protect the external borders and do not reintroduce internal borders. If you do so, you will be sealing off Member States that are dealing with high migratory pressure and leaving them to deal on their own with problems that are, in fact, common problems. This is not the answer to common challenges, and it will jeopardise one of the best achievements of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those Member States that think that closing Schengen borders will solve problems must also explain to their own people that, once you shut the door, you may well keep others out but you will also keep your own people locked in. It works both ways.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the idea of the Schengen area is not just the idea of free movement within this area, but also the idea of a unified political whole defined by the Schengen borders. Attempts to amend the current rules must therefore be weighed up very sensitively, and thought should be given as to the real objective of the proposed amendments.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The current rules already allow individual States to adopt exceptional measures and limit free movement within the internal area in emergency situations for a limited period of time.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that it is only through long-term evaluation of the current rules that we can come up with serious ideas on how to improve the system. I am therefore not sure whether it is necessary – at the first sign of trouble – to amend the rules of a mechanism that has worked so far.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In any case, the amendments to the rules will affect all 27 countries of the Union, and it will surely not be easy to reach the necessary agreement. It is possible, however, that the Commission, with the agreement of the Council, will develop new rules which further improve the current mechanism, only to open up a whole series of new problems.</p>

However, for me, that also means deciding on any changes in consultation with all, and I do mean all, of those involved. I believe that anything else is a step in the opposite direction.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would also like to congratulate you and I wish you lots of success in your new position. As you will see, you will often have your hands full handling debates as lively and important as today’s. I would also like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament who supported Schengen and who made it absolutely clear that Schengen represents freedom and reunification of Europe, openness and also togetherness of European nations and European citizens in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">This debate also confirmed that it is true that the Schengen system has come under pressure recently. We must do everything possible to upgrade it and make it stronger than before. We need to start by restoring trust. We need to maintain mutual trust in our capacity, the capacity of us all, to fully comply with the obligations imposed on us to preserve an area without internal border controls. Therefore, Schengen needs a stronger monitoring and evaluation system. The Commission is looking into the possibilities for further strengthening this new mechanism aiming to bring an adequate response to a situation where a Member State fails to fulfil its obligations at the external borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">A series of measures could be envisaged at EU level to assist a Member State facing heavy pressure at the external borders. It would include inspection visits, technical and financial support, including the participation of Frontex. I think we all agree that we need a complex and comprehensive approach to this problem. We are therefore talking about a complete set of measures including an EU-based mechanism, strengthened Schengen governance, evaluation and reinforcement of Frontex and further guidelines and recommendations to better explain the existing rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has to be seen in parallel with the completion of a common asylum system in 2012, where – as we know – we also very often have big divergences in how the asylum system is applied and how asylum status is granted to refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would reiterate once again that we are fully aware in the Commission of the crucial importance of free movement for the EU and its future. Therefore, the Commission strongly believes that the proposal for the mechanism should be based on Article 77 of the TFEU. This means that the proposal will be subject to ordinary legislative procedure, thus ensuring full involvement of Parliament on an equal footing with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you allow me, I should like to conclude on Denmark, because several of you have referred to the recent and current developments in Denmark. I would like to inform you that on 28 June, the Commission received a reply from Denmark to our questions. The reply is now being carefully evaluated by all the Commission services concerned in order to decide if all the Commission questions have been answered and if all relevant information has been provided. As I said in my introductory remarks, we are fully aware of our important role as a guardian of the Treaties, and we will do our utmost to ensure that all rules, all acquis, and the Schengen acquis in this particular context, are fully respected.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The proposal for modifying the Schengen system is being tabled at a time when the EU is faced with an unprecedented wave of immigration. The message which we must convey, which is the message of a united Europe, is faced with a reality which we cannot ignore. The solutions which we need to resort to must reconcile European values with the current challenges. Consequently, we cannot encourage the reintroduction of border controls, especially as there is the risk that certain states will use this opportunity to exacerbate their xenophobic tendencies, but we cannot sit back and do nothing either. We can agree to the reintroduction of border controls only according to clear conditionality criteria which should not affect the Schengen acquis and which are already provided for in Regulation (EC) No 562/2006. The problems caused by the influx of immigrants must be resolved by sharing the responsibility among the states which have signed the acquis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, we must not forget that these problems originate from the reluctance to implement common European policies in other areas, primarily, a common European asylum and immigration system (which should involve tackling illegal immigration and fighting organised crime). However, this stalemate must not be compounded by even more drastic measures which will harm the EU’s basic values.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I did not support the resolution on the Schengen area because I think it is not appropriate to have a resolution that would refuse, on principle, any expansion of the criteria to enable controls to be set up at internal borders and that would therefore run counter to the conclusions of the European Council and the proposals of the Commission. If we restrict ourselves to the current criteria for ‘public policy and public security’, the Member States will continue to act unilaterally, interpreting these criteria broadly in the case of increased migratory pressures. If this happens, we run the risk of conflating immigration and insecurity when we need to respond to migratory pressures. By contrast, the proposed device aims to create a mechanism enabling controls to be reintroduced at borders only under exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, and through a European mechanism. Now we need to strengthen the governance of the Schengen area. The aim of this initiative is precisely to enable us to provide responses to the crisis that the Schengen area is going through at the moment. This crisis is particularly associated with the fact that certain Member States are no longer able to ensure that they respect their obligations under the Schengen acquis when it comes to effectively controlling their sections of the external borders.</p>

They feel that this violates one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. However, the fact that they acted in this manner is not the fault of these Member States, but that of the EU leadership. This step is a consequence, the consequence of the external borders of the European Union being quite weak and unable to stop the tide of immigrants. The immigration wave must be stopped and crime must be forced back, so that the European people can feel safe in their own countries once more.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Membership of the Schengen area entails complete freedom of movement for citizens of a Member State within this area and the total removal of border controls between Member States. The security of the Schengen area depends on the stringent nature and the effectiveness of the controls imposed by each Member State of the Schengen area at the EU’s external borders.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The free movement of persons is one of the Union’s fundamental rights, while achieving the internal market is based on the free movement of goods, services and persons. The Schengen area is one of the EU’s main achievements. This is why it is important for us to promote and defend the principles which govern it. The economic and financial crisis must not be used as an excuse for certain Member States to introduce restrictions on the free movement of persons. I reaffirm my strong opposition to any new Schengen mechanism with objectives other than reinforcing the free movement of persons. We cannot have double standards when it comes to the Schengen area. I deplore the attempt being made by some Member States to reintroduce controls unilaterally at the EU’s internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission to evaluate, as a matter of urgency, compliance with the Community acquis and the Schengen acquis, in the event of the Royal Kingdom of Denmark adopting the decision to reintroduce controls at its borders.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we attach great importance to having an effective democratic oversight of the EU foreign, security and defence policy, and fully recognise that this is a shared responsibility of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="en">This responsibility implies a certain duty of cooperation by the parliaments and parliamentarians in achieving the objectives of the CFSP/CSDP – including protecting the interests and security of European citizens – in the most effective way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliamentarians are also uniquely placed to communicate the merits of the CFSP/CSDP to citizens and civil society, and thus participate in the project of building, promoting and giving visibility to the EU foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">This important responsibility of parliaments is explicitly recognised in the report on the Implementation of the European Security strategy, which was endorsed by Heads of State or Government in 2008. It says that ‘Maintaining public support for our global engagement is fundamental. … We deploy police, judicial experts and soldiers in unstable zones around the world. There is an onus on governments, parliaments and EU institutions to communicate how this contributes to security at home’.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware of the current discussions between national parliaments and the European Parliament about the setting up of a new interparliamentary conference for CFSP/CSDP, in accordance with Protocol 1 of the Lisbon Treaty. Everyone recognises that the closing down of the WEU Parliamentary Assembly on 10 May 2011 has made the setting up of such a body even more urgent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are confident that a mutually convenient agreement will soon be found, hopefully under the chairmanship of the Polish Parliament during the second half of this year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, Mr President, my sincere congratulations on your election, which I was personally very pleased about. Mr Vice-President, my group and I believe that we urgently need to bring about cooperation on this issue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. This cooperation, which is described in Article 9 of the Protocol, serves to ensure that we realise our respective responsibilities in respect of the administrations in question, for which each parliament has its own responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament is competent in certain fields, as we have agreed within the framework of the Treaty, as we have agreed in the agreement with the Commission and the Council in connection with the External Action Service with the Accountability Rule, with the competences for the budget and the right of budgetary control. Then there are questions that relate to military aspects and the use of armies, which fall within the competence of the national parliaments concerned. The national parliaments also have a role to play in supervising their national governments, by means of which they have an influence on European policy. There is no joint responsibility for joint supervision; rather, each party is responsible for its own area.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in order to ensure that we do this correctly, we need cooperation, as part of which we keep each other informed so that we are all aware of what is necessary in order to duly perform our supervisory duties. We therefore need to make clear that this is only possible for the national parliaments under the auspices of an agreement pursuant to Article 9 of the Protocol and not under Article 10, as Article 10 concerns cooperation of the national parliaments with the participation of the European Parliament. What we are talking about here is cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. There is a considerable difference between the two concepts. I hope that we will be able to reach a reasonable agreement on this basis, as it has been stated in various resolutions – such as in the Gualtieri report, in my report, but also once again in this draft – so as, in this way, to judiciously establish the position of the European Parliament, which does want cooperation of this kind and sees it as urgent.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-609-000" speaker_id="96892" name="Roberto Gualtieri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are preparing to vote on is important and timely because it sets out and unequivocally clarifies the principles that must guide the action of Parliament and its representatives in conducting these difficult negotiations with national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="it">First and foremost, these principles derive from Treaties that, by getting rid of the pillar structure, on the one hand, and assigning Parliament the role of representing citizens directly at EU level, on the other, make the European Parliament a vital source of democratic legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as EU policies</p>
      <p sl="it">This double innovation results, as we know, in increased functions and responsibilities, from the vote to approve the High Representative, to the referral powers established by Article 36, to the budget powers that, we must remember, make the European Parliament the budgetary authority for the exceptionally large increase in CSDP missions which, as we are aware, are civil missions.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the reasons that lead us to take, with determination and readiness for dialogue, the road towards genuine agreement with national parliaments are also political and pragmatic. Interparliamentary cooperation is appropriate and necessary to strengthen support for the CFSP and the CSDP and to increase consistency between them and the choices made by Member States at national level.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is precisely for this reason that this cooperation should represent, in a balanced way, the institutions that express Europe’s democratic legitimacy at a different level, and an imbalance that excessively compromises Parliament’s power would be incongruous with the mission to Europeanise the debate on foreign security and defence policy in Europe, which is at the root of the idea of holding a conference.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why it is good for tomorrow’s vote to clarify that the readiness for debate is accompanied by the utmost commitment to certain principles, starting with the principle that, as Article 9 of the first protocol clearly states, no regular form of interparliamentary cooperation can be established without Parliament’s consent.</p>

      <p sl="de">We need time to allow the External Action Service and the new policy approach to produce results at executive level.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate you on your new office. Mr President, Mr Vice-President, it is very easy to speak after the three preceding speakers as we, in this House, have had a common cross-party position on this subject for quite some time and are acting in concert. You can therefore regard everything that has been said already as echoed by me.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do have two thoughts to add, however. First of all, Commissioner Šefčovič, you made reference to the Polish Presidency of the Council. It was an important reference that you made, as we are in a position to observe together that the Polish Presidency wishes to accord a quite special significance to the common security and defence policy (CSDP). The Presidency wishes to actively engage, for example, in the issue of ‘pooling and sharing’ in relation to ‘battlegroups’. I believe that that is a sound basis on which to attempt, in partnership with the Polish Presidency, to actually take a step forwards in this regard. I would very much welcome it if this House, too, would very actively approach the Polish lower house, the Sejm, the competent committee there, and those in Poland with an interest in this issue, in order to ensure that we actually go the whole nine yards in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second thought that I wanted to add is as follows. Given that what has been said in connection with the duties of the European Parliament as part of the CSDP is correct, Parliament must also ensure that, within the framework of the internal rules applicable in this House, the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, which bears primary responsibility for this area, is given the ability to actually fulfil this role. We have an obligation to fulfil in this regard, and we are not good enough at it at this point in time. If we want our counterparts in the national parliaments to take us seriously, we must be able to work more effectively ourselves, and to do that, there are a couple of rules that we need to emend.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is no other policy area where the European Parliament has so few rights of codecision as in the fields of foreign and, especially, of military policy. When it comes to EU military operations, it is the Heads of State or Government alone, meeting in the European Council, who make the decisions. When it comes to the key issue of war and peace, then, the European Parliament has absolutely no right to be heard or even to oversee. There is not even a binding rule that Parliament must be informed before the Union launches a foreign intervention.</p>
      <p sl="de">In light of the establishment of the European External Action Service, which, in practice, has become the executive arm of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), and of the start-up fund for military operations, which has a firm basis in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need for more monitoring powers for the national parliaments and for the European Parliament, and for these powers to actually be effective. The resolution on the table does state that the cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament needs to be improved, but there is a definite lack of specific proposals as to how that can be done.</p>
      <p sl="de">The interparliamentary assembly that we have proposed – to be composed of representatives from both national and European level – could pave the way for the resolution or at least attenuation of glaring democratic deficits. Such an interparliamentary assembly need not be composed of all the parties represented in the parliaments in order to ensure real and democratic supervision of European foreign and security policy. It would be nice if our amendments enacting this were to be approved tomorrow.</p>

As far as procedure is concerned, other countries in the European Council should be consulted first in this matter and their opinions taken into account, should they not? Yet if Germany’s actions do arouse opposition, where were the voices of protest from France and Russia – countries which still grossly violate human rights – with regard to this transaction?
