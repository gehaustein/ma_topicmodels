      <p sl="unknown">Once again, I am happy to welcome you to our November plenary, and I can open it with an announcement which comes as good news to us all: hundreds of Kurds being held in Turkish prisons ended their hunger strike yesterday. I am relieved that this 67-day-old protest has ended before any human lives were lost.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As you know, I wrote to the Turkish Justice Minister urging him to listen to the hunger strikers’ demands. I am delighted that the Turkish Government has acceded to the strikers’ demand that use of the Kurdish language be permitted in schools and in the courts. Therefore it has acceded at least to some of the demands made of it, and has introduced a bill on use of the Kurdish language in court proceedings before parliament. That is an important step, with regard to us too, because the European Parliament has long been voicing that same demand.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am sure, I was greatly saddened to hear of the deaths of Palestinian and Israeli civilians. On behalf of this House, I expressly deplore the escalation of violence between Hamas and Israel. I emphatically urge both sides to eschew violence and exercise the utmost restraint in order to prevent further escalation and more deaths.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is always the civilians on both sides who pay the highest price for this vicious circle of aggression and recrimination. The European Parliament supports all diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire. Therefore, may I remind you that, on Wednesday afternoon, the plenary will be debating the situation in the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not sure if this is related to the agenda, but I do not know where else to raise it. This House has the habit of expressing its solidarity and paying respect to victims of human rights violations.

      <p sl="en">I think that this is a violation of human rights. It is the right to life that was denied to that woman, and I think that it would be appropriate for this Parliament to pay its respects to the family of the victim.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have submitted a question for oral answer to this Parliament, to be dealt with tomorrow afternoon. The motion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was approved unanimously, by 44 members out of the 44 who were present, and on this occasion it became clear that it would be beneficial to seek a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="it">I know that the Bureau has decided in the first instance not to accept our motion. Mr President, I would like to ask this Chamber and you if we could review this position, since we believe that Europe is currently going through extremely difficult times in many sectors, but particularly in steel and steelmaking, given that jobs in this sector fell by 10.6 % during 2011 and, indeed, there is talk of another reduction by 10.4 % this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, I think it would be beneficial to everyone to send a signal to the Commission and to Europe if, after tomorrow’s debate, we could already think of passing a resolution in December.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am not surprised that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy unanimously approved an oral question and debate on this matter, because the issue of European industrialisation, or indeed re-industrialisation in certain areas which have abandoned industry, is crucial for the future of the Union, for its progress and for innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this matter that we are going to debate should prompt us to talk about the steel problem, particularly in certain regions in Europe, but also about the industrial programme for the future of the European Union. My group would be in favour of a resolution provided that it is actually approved at the next plenary sitting in December.</p>

If you feel that drafting a resolution will help to resolve the problems, then I am not sure I can agree, to put it diplomatically.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we should make this an urgent public issue. That is what we would suggest, and we shall undoubtedly return to the matter in future.

Very few words to explain that we stand on the brink of war here – not just between Israel and Palestine, but war involving the whole region. Therefore I think it is important that Parliament should now state its position, should say clearly where it stands so that we can make it clear to the Council – the Council will also be addressing the matter – and to forthcoming summits what Parliament thinks about this. We cannot postpone it. This quarrel is dangerous, and I think it is our duty, as a politically engaged body, to adopt a clear stance on it through the medium of a resolution.</p>

    <intervention id="1-036-000" speaker_id="1911" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0320/2012) by Tadeusz Zwiefka, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (COM(2010)0748 – C7-0433/2010 – 2010/0383(COD)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-038-000" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, from the outset of our work on the report on the recasting of the regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, I realised the great complexity of the material we had to deal with. Improving and facilitating the application of a regulation whose operation is generally considered to be very satisfactory has proved no easy task. Many matters have required our attention over the year or so, but I believe that, on all the issues, both the more and less controversial, we have managed to work out satisfactory compromises. A large number of informal tripartite discussions held during the Polish, Danish and Cypriot Presidencies have enabled us to reach a degree of rapprochement and mutual understanding such that today it is possible to speak of agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The most important issue with which we began our work on the regulation was abolition of the exequatur procedure. During the Polish Presidency, we arrived at a joint approach that was, in the great majority of cases, consistent with the amendments proposed by me in the report. The exequatur procedure will accordingly be abolished, thus facilitating the circulation of court judgments in civil and commercial cases, shortening the time needed to enforce judgments and considerably reducing the procedural costs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, all the safeguards for the defendant that provide a basis for suspending or refusing enforcement of a judgment will be maintained, including the public policy clause. The introduction of such a change was possible because of the greater level of confidence in the legal systems of the Member States, and today we can consider the abolishment of the exequatur procedure as our joint success.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Both in the Council and in Parliament, the question of widening the scope of application of the Regulation to third countries, and the corresponding ‘rebound effect’, was a highly emotive issue. From the outset, I was very sceptical, not about the idea itself, but rather about taking an over-hasty decision to make such wide-ranging changes to the Brussels I Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The compromise reached in the course of our meetings provides that a widening of jurisdiction be introduced for consumer contracts and individual employment contracts. That means that a consumer will be also be able to sue a seller from outside the Union in his own Member State, the State in which he lives. That concept proved a very attractive solution both for its advocates and for those who considered full harmonisation of the jurisdictional provisions to be premature. It is without doubt a step in the right direction, extending the administration of justice for the weaker party. At the same time, thanks to the inclusion of the revision clause, we retain the possibility of taking another look at the issue of judgments in such cases in the coming months and years, and of making any necessary changes to harmonisation of the jurisdictional rules.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question of arbitration agreements proved rather complicated. After numerous discussions, Parliament took the view that the best solution was to retain the status quo in this area, i.e. to leave arbitration wholly outside the scope of application of the regulation. The European Parliament’s position was reflected in the final compromise, since we retain the status quo in the operative part of the Regulation while explaining the application of the rule in great detail in the preamble.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The next issue whose importance for Parliament I wish to stress is the question of delegated acts. They were included in the Commission’s original proposal but were deleted during negotiations in the Council. However, following a rapid intervention by Parliament, delegated acts were reinstated by the Danish Presidency, to our full satisfaction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A great deal of reflection was also required by the issue of choice-of-court agreements. I would pay tribute to the Cypriot Presidency for setting out, in the preamble, the specific areas of application of the relevant provisions. I believe they are sufficiently detailed to be of assistance when it comes to interpreting the provisions of the operative part of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, Mr President, I wish to thank most heartily all the parties involved in this legislative procedure: the Commission (especially Commissioner Reding), the Polish, Danish and Cypriot Presidencies, my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs, and all those who were actively committed to the same end – a very positive conclusion to the work.</p>

    <intervention id="1-040-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased to see the reform of the Brussels I Regulation on the agenda of this plenary session, and I would like to thank all those very dedicated politicians and administrators who have managed to bring this forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, of course, your rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, has done a wonderful job, together with this committee and, secondly, the Presidencies – the Polish and Danish Presidencies and now the Cyprus Presidency – have ensured a smooth finalisation of this file in the upcoming December Council. Now this is a real success story, for citizens, for companies and for the Single Market, and it is one of those success stories which builds a European area of justice. It also shows that justice can contribute to growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are speaking here about 500 million consumers; we are speaking about companies, mainly SMEs, which are reluctant to use the potential of the Internal Market because of many legal obstacles. Forty per cent of companies would be more inclined to trade cross-border if the procedures for settling disputes were simplified, so that is precisely what we are doing here: removing bureaucratic obstacles which impose extra costs and legal uncertainty on companies; and this is part of our central objective to create a single market which is attractive also to our SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the reform of Brussels I we are making an important contribution. As the rapporteur has already said, we are abolishing the exequatur procedure, a procedure which in most cases is not necessary but which costs money – usually EUR 2 000 per case wasted on this formality. In future we will get rid of this red tape; the benefits to companies will be EUR 47 million per year and we will actually do what the United States has been doing for a long time under Article IV of the Constitution, which says that there is a principle of full faith and credit. By abolishing exequatur we will also have a ‘full faith and credit’ principle in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is the question of the choice-of-court agreements, which will be better respected in the future. The overwhelming majority of EU businesses – almost 70 % of all companies and 90 % of large companies – use choice-of-court agreements. The parties involved need to be sure that their choice will be respected; the review which is on the table now provides greater legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the external aspects of Brussels I, when there are proceedings with third states, and also with respect to the weaker parties, we have taken decisions to ensure that all consumers and employees in Europe will have access to the courts in Europe no matter where they live. This is a real concrete benefit for our European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the difficult question of arbitration, Mr Zwiefka, I can accept the compromise, which I believe marks a step in the right direction. In conclusion, Mr President, this is an important step towards a real European area of justice. I would like to thank Parliament for its support and I look forward to defending the proposal of Parliament in the Council, and then to celebrating a success in December.</p>

    <intervention id="1-041-000" speaker_id="96998" name="Evelyn Regner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Reding, after two full years of talks, I must begin by thanking our dogged and patient rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, for the way in which he has guided our deliberations. Thanks are also due to the Cypriot Presidency, sadly not represented here today, and to the Danish and Polish Presidencies which preceded it and did a great deal of very constructive work.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not have anything revolutionary, but in terms of what we as legislators can achieve, we have ended up with a reasonable result which improves things for employees and consumers. Even before this recast version, the Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments within the EU was already one of the flagship single market regulations that worked well. I should like to highlight a few positive points which are especially important to my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, there are clear rules on access to justice and the enforceability of the individual’s rights, something that is important to members of the public, businesses and the functioning of the single market as a whole. Abolition of the exequatur process was, of course, the core task we had to complete, and despite initial doubts we have succeeded. Application of the Regulation is to be extended to non-EU countries; the intention of the European Commission is that this should not apply in all cases, but it will at least apply in consumer affairs and matters of individual employment contracts, with protection for the weaker party. That is extremely important. The negotiations on this Regulation have been with us since the 2009 Green Paper, so since the start of the parliamentary term, and this recast version has been two whole years in the making.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it very odd that the Commission has presented this reworked version as a ‘recast’ text. In my view, recasting is supposed to be a procedural simplification of non-controversial subjects, designed to speed up the procedure for adapting legal texts. Brussels I is most definitely not uncontroversial, so as a result the process was neither simple nor brief. I can only imagine that the Commission’s motive in choosing to recast is the desire to restrict the legislative power of Parliament, but also of the Council. To my mind, the democratic legitimacy of that is highly suspect. For that reason, I ask that the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission be revised accordingly. We cannot have the executive restricting the legislative process like this and, at the same time, proposing radical changes to the Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now to what I see as the most important thing, right at the end. Looking to the future of the Brussels I Regulation, I recommend, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that the Commission introduces jurisdiction for industrial action, in order to stop proceedings brought as the result of strikes from dragging on. Apart from anything else, this would at last establish coherence between procedural law and materially applicable law. The Rome II Regulation determines which law is applicable to claims or damage which have a cross-border impact. This rules that, in cases of damage suffered in connection with strike action, the law of the country where the industrial action was taken should apply. Why should the same not apply in respect of the jurisdiction of the courts? I would ask the Commission to give thought to this. We in the European Parliament most certainly shall.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at a time when, for some nostalgic nationalists, speaking of closer European integration sounds provocative, we are about to vote on amendments to a regulation which forms the basis for the difficult but necessary process of harmonising and bringing closer together the national legal systems. Allow me therefore to congratulate Mr Zwiefka on the excellent work carried out and his success – after around two years of difficult negotiations – in bringing to a close the process of revising a regulation which has been of fundamental importance to citizens of the Union. Brussels I in fact establishes provisions which are of the utmost importance in ensuring sufficient access to justice and equality of treatment before all the courts which have competence in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">It sets up common standards in civil and commercial matters, clarifying which Court has competence in a cross-border dispute, and making the sentences issued enforceable in the different States. The amendments made to the regulation are required in order to put into practice the wish to create a European area for justice which promotes judicial certainty and predictability of decisions, thus making transnational trade easier and strengthening the single market. That said, I believe that progress towards an ever deeper harmonisation of the standards of substantive law must proceed with the appropriate caution and attention in order to ensure certainty of law and to protect less favoured parties.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur in favour of consumers, who will benefit from the principle of protection for the weaker party. A basic principle under which, in a legal dispute between consumers and businesses, the consumer will always be able to choose a court in the Member State of his or her residence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Similarly, I share the prudent approach taken by Mr Zwiefka regarding the abolition of the exequatur: while on the one hand abolishing the exequatur would allow recognition of sentences to be speeded up at a later stage, on the other I believe that measures for safeguarding defendants’ rights must be maintained. It is therefore necessary for defendants to have the possibility of contesting a decision if their right to a fair trial has been breached and if the decision goes against ordre public in the reference State.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my compliments to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I hope we shall reach broad interinstitutional and political consensus on a regulation which forms the template not only for cooperation in the civil courts but also for political determination based on the process of European integration.</p>

      <p sl="es">This step does not just simplify unwieldy proceedings; it is a step towards that longed-for European unification, unity even, for which we strive every day and which is the real rationale of this parliamentary institution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, sincere thanks first of all to the rapporteur and to those honourable Members who, like me, have worked on this matter for two years. We all felt slightly desperate when we next met with the Council and all the old obstacles surfaced yet again. In the end, though, an important principle gained acceptance: acting across borders – something that is increasingly common in the European Union – requires rules which are enforceable, clear and framed in a way that does not place the weaker party in an untenable position right from the start. Therefore, in this piece of legislation, what we have done is attempt to improve access to justice, to make the law comprehensible and clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings us to a major difficulty: mutual recognition. Each of the 27 Member States represented in this House believes that its legal system, and its system alone, is the best in the world. However, if we are to work together, we must learn to recognise the decisions, documents, etc. of other systems. Hitherto there has always been a significant lack of trust in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course everyone, in any given instance, will be able to find an example of how his law is better than someone else’s. That does not mean, though, that it is always the case. I therefore think this is a good and important step. I think it is important that we have strengthened the position of the weaker party, and I think it is important that we have given consumers, who shop internationally these days, new ways of enforcing their rights faster, better and more clearly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thank you too for the revision clause. We shall see if we can expand these matters further, but as I say, a revision clause takes care of that. I regard what we are proposing and will be voting on as an important step. It will not be the last, certainly not in this field of legal rules, but it will help us to show the public more clearly what the European Union can do, and what it does, on their behalf.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, although I very much appreciate the Commission’s efforts to create a solid mechanism for resolving cross-border disputes on civil and commercial matters in the European Union, I think the proposal put forward is not moving settlement of those issues in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The legal systems of the Member States have developed along their own lines over centuries, and the way the written law is applied in individual countries has taken shape differently, according to their traditions of civilisation and culture. In Spain, for example – where a court wanted to remove a child living in Slovakia from his mother – or in the UK – where courts act as a shield for the controversial practices of its local social welfare system in removing the children of families going to Britain for work – experience shows us the way that courts operate, handing down specific rulings that favour the interests of citizens or legal persons from their own countries. This is an everyday reality in the European Union. When the administration of justice is in that state, the abolition of certain protective mechanisms – such as the right to challenge recognition or enforcement of a judgment on the ground of incompatibility with recognising and enforcing a Member State’s public policy, for example – is, in my view, absolutely divorced from real life.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If we have different assessments of legal questions in the individual Member States of the European Union, we cannot really just transfer the judgments of the courts from one country to another. After all, a legal entity affected by a judgment given abroad must also have the right to have enforcement of this judgment reviewed from the point of view of the law of his country – the one in which he lives or operates.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in practice, the European Judicial Area operates to the detriment of ordinary citizens and small businesses. By contrast, it is especially useful to large businesses and those of our fellow citizens who have the wherewithal to pay teams of national and international lawyers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The murky affair of the extradition of Aurore Martin from France to Spain is a case in point. The case is a disgrace to France and the European Union. The text before us, far from being an improvement on the current situation, proposes to increase inequality between persons subject to law. A judgment given in one Member State would become enforceable, without any intermediate procedure, in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Challenging the right to object to recognition or enforcement of a Member State judgment on the ground of manifest incompatibility with the enforcing Member State’s public policy is a genuinely backward step. Almost no review of the jurisdiction of the courts of origin would be possible. Justice would function on autopilot. I can in no way endorse a text of this nature, especially in the light of the scandalous Aurore Martin case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, this document is a perfect illustration of the authoritarian slide, to put it mildly, of European institutions whose ultraliberal economic model is in crisis. Indeed, we are moving from a liberal Europe to an ordoliberal Europe.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, based on what Mr Zwiefka said, I ask myself the following question: Why, if the regulation has worked well so far, do we have to change it? I come up with two answers that I find very disturbing. These come from what Ms Reding said. The first one, regarding the choice of court, is in response to Ms Reding’s statement that 90 % of large companies use choice-of-court agreements. This is because a large company is the stronger party in a deal. It will want to choose a court that it considers would be more favourable towards it. That is why I do not think that small companies will benefit from changes to the regulation. On the contrary, it is the large companies that will gain. The second point concerns what Ms Reding said: that we would get closer to the system used in the United States, that is, the regulation would bring greater federalisation of Europe. As an MEP who is fighting for a Europe of nation-states, of nations, I completely agree with what Mr Paška said on this issue, and find this position of further integration and greater federalisation of Europe unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Reding, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the completion of this complex dossier, which comes at the end of a long and involved debate which has finally arrived at agreement with the Council and which fully reflects the position of Parliament on the abolition of the so-called exequatur without any exceptions. This is a particularly important step because, by abolishing this exequatur, we automatically eliminate an intermediate judicial procedure – which, by the way, has been found in practice to have become nowadays a mere formality – and we bring down the costs and time required by cross-border disputes.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is sure to be better protection for citizens once they can apply to a court in their own country of origin in respect of disputes with companies who also operate in third countries. In particular, there will be better agreements on the choice of the competent court, to avoid so-called abusive litigation tactics. This represents considerable progress in further facilitating the free circulation of judgments and, in particular, enhancing access to justice and guaranteeing less bureaucracy and less waste, in terms of both time and money, and regulations with certainty which are also more accessible.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that, in a time of crisis, citizens, families and businesses will all very much appreciate this streamlining of bureaucracy and simplification of procedures.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, for the gradual establishment of a real area of justice, it is vital that we adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation – and these will have cross-border implications.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, certain differences between national rules governing jurisdiction and the recognition of judgments still present an obstacle. Members from Slovakia and from other countries have already mentioned examples of citizens affected by this, and it is precisely so that such cases do not arise that we need provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to ensure rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a Member State. Therefore, the Brussels I Regulation is also exceptionally important for citizens of the European Union and for European businesses. Although the measure is partially satisfactory in its current form, some of its provisions need to be amended. I unequivocally support, for example, the abolition of exequatur, as our aim is to facilitate the free circulation of judgments and to enhance access to justice for our citizens. Overall, we must improve the Regulation in order to guarantee predictability and a high level of legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, in every case, our priorities must be the protection of weaker countries, the right to fair legal proceedings and clear reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European area of freedom, security and justice facilitates access to justice, in particular through the principle of mutual recognition of judicial and extra-judicial decisions in civil matters. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the EU needs to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Mutual trust in the administration of justice in the EU justifies the principle that judgments given in a Member State should be recognised without the need for any special procedure, and cross-border litigation needs to be made less time-consuming and costly. To ensure the protection of consumers and employees, to safeguard the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States in situations where they have exclusive jurisdiction and to respect party autonomy, certain rules of jurisdiction in the current Regulation should apply regardless of the defendant’s domicile.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To protect employees’ rights, we stress the importance of the provisions of Articles 19 and 20, particularly the provision by which an employer not domiciled in a Member State can be taken to court in a Member State. In relation to consumer and employment contracts, the weaker party should to be protected by rules of jurisdiction more favourable to his interests than the generally applicable rules.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the question for oral answer to the Commission concerning the declaration of acceptance of the accession of eight third countries to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, tabled by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Luigi Berlinguer, Eva Lichtenberger, Francesco Enrico Speroni, Alexandra Thein and Tadeusz Zwiefka on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs (O-000159/2012 – B7-0367/2012).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, also to Mr Stoyanov. The Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is enormously significant in that it enables wrongfully removed children to be returned promptly to their most recent state of habitual residence. The Commission rightly considers that the European Union has exclusive competence in deciding whether the eight countries of Morocco, Russia, Andorra, the Seychelles, Albania, Gabon, Singapore and Armenia may accede to the Convention. The European Court of Justice has also clarified that matters within the EU which clearly fall under Union competence are also covered by the Union’s external competence. In this instance, with the Brussels II Regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, the Union is clearly competent. This makes it plain to everybody that, in matters of international child abduction, external competence rests exclusively with the Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">To that extent, the message of the Committee on Legal Affairs is directed primarily at the Council. The Council must cease its stalling tactics on this important matter forthwith. The European Parliament must be consulted too. As the elected representatives of the people, we are constantly confronted with the problems entailed. Who, if not the European Parliament, looks after the concerns of the public? The Committee on Legal Affairs can see no reason why these countries should not join. The wellbeing of children must always come first. National vanities are totally inappropriate in these cases. Hence the question to the Commission of why the Council is blocking so important a decision. It is imperative that these eight countries should sign up to the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of their accession is evidenced by numerous tragic cases reported in the media, amongst them a case of alleged child abduction in the country I know best, my native land of Austria. This case does not entail dealings with a non-Member State, but it shows the kind of family tragedy that can occur. Little Oliver Weilharter is currently with his father in Denmark. His mother and grandparents in Austria are beside themselves with worry that Oliver may not be allowed to return to Austria. The points of contention are two judgments from Denmark and Austria which rule differently on the matter of the child’s wrongful removal. The Hague Convention on Child Abduction in not applicable in this instance because the Danish courts do not deem the father’s behaviour to have been abduction. However, the same problem arises over the Brussels II Regulation, which is not binding on Denmark.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many EU citizens have family ties to the applicant countries of Russia and Morocco. Similar cases could be avoided and fought if these countries accede. The example of Oliver shows that the accession of these eight countries is essential to the wellbeing of children.</p>

    <intervention id="1-061-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for having raised this very important question because we all know that parental child abduction is a tragedy that has very often substantial long-term consequences for the child. The prevention of child abduction should therefore be a central part of EU policy to promote the rights of the child and, in international cases, multilateral rules are key to ensuring the protection of children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2007 the European Union has been a full member of The Hague Conference on Private International Law and in that context the Union supports the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and encourages third states to accede to it. To date there are 87 contracting parties to the Hague Convention, including all the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Convention establishes a system of cooperation between the contracting parties to restore the status quo ante of the wrongfully removed or retained child, but for these systems to operate an explicit declaration of acceptance is necessary and this is why the Commission last year presented a package of proposals for the EU’s acceptance of the accession of eight new contracting parties to the Convention, including key partners such as Russia and Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="en">The adoption of such proposals would ensure that all Member States have the possibility to use the Hague Mechanism with all the contracting parties of the Convention for very concrete child abduction cases; this would be in the best interest of children and it would also respect the principle of the unity and external representation of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I really do regret that this package has been blocked in the Council for almost a year. In practice this means, for example, that Singapore’s accession has been accepted by 10 Member States, Morocco’s by 14 and Seychelles’ by 18 Member States. It also means that after having promoted Russia’s accession for many years and having finally persuaded Russia to accede, the European Union as a whole is now not able to accept this accession and the Russian authorities are of course raising this with us in the regular high-level meetings we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">I deeply regret that despite their declarations of intent, the Member States as a whole have so far failed to show the sensitivity and the political will which are needed in order to tackle the current fragmented situation in the field of international child abduction. I am afraid that we may need to ask the Court of Justice to deliver a verdict on this institutional dispute on competences which has very undesirable consequences. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Lichtenberger, for having supported the Commission’s proposal and the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole for having worked on this. We share the same urgent need to protect children, prevent child abductions and minimise the distress that families suffer due to the legal uncertainty and the lack of a simple and unified procedure at EU level in this matter. I really regret that we are fighting about procedures instead of fighting for the good of the child.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and Vice-President Reding, taking as my starting point a fact: over the past few years, there has been a progressive and positive growth in the movement of persons. Consequently, marriages and relationships – and indeed, on the other hand, divorces and separations – between couples of different nationalities have also been on the increase. Some data: every year around 300 000 couples of different nationality get married in Europe. Around half of these marriages end in divorce or separation; and while a relationship breakdown between spouses is fraught with disagreements or downright dramatic, it is often children who suffer the negative effects of this, and there are clashes not only between the two parents but also between two different States and two different judicial systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is for this very reason that, among other things, the Hague Convention, which has been signed by 87 countries and all the Member States of the European Union, is important: it is one of the most important multilateral agreements for child protection; it sets fundamental rules and establishes clear criteria, particularly when the child is at risk of forced removal or a failure to return to his or her usual country of residence. These are rules to protect children from traumatic disputes in which these little ones are in danger of becoming real victims.</p>
      <p sl="it">I find it particularly serious and, indeed, deplorable that the Council has blocked the procedure for eight countries to accede to the Hague Convention. In the past few weeks alone, to give an example, there have been new cases of international child abduction involving Russia, which is one of the countries to which this declaration of acceptance relates; the accession of one country, namely Russia, has been waiting for acceptance either from the European Union or from the Member States for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, family is a key value in society for the Member States of the European Union, and the institutions must support and defend it, in particular when it is in crisis, primarily in order to protect as paramount the interests of the child. Therefore, blocking a procedure which should be dealt with quickly not only undoes the progress of a procedure that helps in the proper functioning of the Union but, most of all, in fact, undoes the protection as paramount of the interests of the child.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, speaking also as the representative of the European Parliament in cases of international abduction, I know that a vast array of situations is coming into being, purely because of uncertainty about the applicable law, conflicts between jurisdictions and insufficient knowledge and awareness of the rights and duties of couples of mixed nationality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I find the Council’s policy of procrastination particularly deplorable here. Child abduction is by definition a traumatic event, certainly for the children themselves and, in most cases, for the parents too.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sure all of us will agree that we must at least improve the legal provisions which will enable a child to be returned as promptly as possible to the familiar surroundings of its habitual place of residence.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Hague Convention is one such mechanism which safeguards and upholds the rights of the child in these cases and helps both sides in cases of child abduction. We have two partners in the queue: Russia and Morocco, where dramatic cases routinely arise and are always extremely difficult to resolve.</p>
      <p sl="de">We could sort this problem out for the people concerned tomorrow, were it not for the Council – and let us be clear on this – playing what I see as an inadmissible power game in a wholly inappropriate area. The Council does not want the European Parliament to have any say in this matter. The Council cannot agree on certain matters, protracted negotiations – with Russia in particular – remain fruitless, and we cannot give the help we could give if the Hague Convention applied to these states.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be very interesting to know how many children and parents have already been harmed by these delaying tactics on the part of the Council. I urge the Council to find something else to block. It is the fate of children that is at stake here! Please allow us to continue the procedure properly, with the participation of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the harrowing images from Gaza are a stark reminder that children are most vulnerable when they are not at the centre of international human rights protection. Children need to feature much more centrally in our legislative and policy considerations at all levels; they are let down by public authorities and in so many ways their voices are not heard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Economic policies being pursued by governments and being promoted by the European Union give rise to countless cases of child neglect, which was clear from discussions at the Child Poverty Conference in Belfast last Friday. While the people of Ireland voted on 10 November to change the constitution so as to protect the rights of the child, the Dublin Government needs to adequately resource the essential support services for children and for families. But at least this was a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the ease of international travel and the increase in international relations have led to a rapid rise in the number of international child abductions. This is why the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction is an important part of the international architecture for the protection of children, as it allows for abducted children to be speedily returned to their proper country of residence.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are concerns about the pace of resolution, some cases taking years to resolve while some are never resolved at all. The fact that the Council is blocking the accession of third countries is a scandal; it must be reversed.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we find ourselves in a curious situation, to say the least. Here we have a matter of exceptional importance to expedite, a positive matter, but are prevented from doing so by an interinstitutional dispute. That is unthinkable, indeed scandalous. I am convinced that today’s debate is a powerful and heated appeal to the European Council to stop fooling around and to take the predicament of many children and parents seriously. If I were a proponent of the conspiracy theory of history, I would say the Council is deliberately exploiting a dispute with Parliament in order to block resolution of this important matter. Worse still, the Council, carried away by ambition, is bent on proving that it is right. The legal services of the European Parliament have stated unambiguously that, in matters of international child abduction, the European Union has exclusive competence. Therefore, in accordance with the Treaties, the Council should deal with this matter rapidly, together with the European Parliament, by the consent procedure. We know very well how difficult it is to persuade certain countries to accede to the Hague Convention, because it is not easy for them. That is not a process that occurs very quickly, but it is terribly important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore ask all who have influence in the matter not to block the resolution of such an extraordinarily important issue, but to allow States which have decided to accede to this international agreement on the protection of children and children’s rights to accede to an agreement permitting the introduction of greater legal order in the difficult and complicated situation concerning the international abduction of children. I am deeply convinced that we shall quickly reach agreement, for otherwise we shall all have made ourselves a laughing stock. That is not something I want to see. We, the European Parliament, call on the Council to end this dispute and proceed to a purposeful, substantive resolution of the problem in accordance with the Treaties. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, sadly, the illegal movement or retention of a child is not a rare or isolated event. When parents divorce, differences often emerge over custody of the children, and, in some cases, one of the parents chooses to leave the country with the child, without the other parent’s agreement. Situations of this kind occur in very many countries around the world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Before the convention was adopted, there were problems when the return of the child had to be ensured, because of differences between the legal systems of each country. If forced to live in a foreign environment, children can develop social and linguistic disorders that emerge in the medium and long term. I believe that the eight countries should accede to the Convention as soon as possible.</p>

You could pick any issue over which to have an institutional fight, but do not pick children. Even if only one child’s life is put in danger because of this institutional fight, that is one too many.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0269/2012) by Jan Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the marketing and use of explosives precursors (COM(2010)0473 – C7-0279/2010 – 2010/0246(COD)).</p>

    <intervention id="1-074-000" speaker_id="1965" name="Jan Mulder" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">The Commission’s proposal on this matter already came quite a while before the events in Norway, which have once again brought us face to face with the facts. In a common market in the European Union, our rules need to be as similar as possible in order to control the sale of substances that can be used as explosives as much as possible and eliminate as many risks as possible. Therefore it is good that the Commission has proposed a regulation and not a directive. We believe that as many countries as possible should observe the common rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One exception has been made. Parliament and the Commission were more or less in agreement, but there was not full agreement within the Council. One country already has a registration system instead of a licensing system and wishes to continue with that. Parliament has agreed, and we are satisfied with the compromise. In five years’ time, we will evaluate which system is best and perhaps then we can establish a uniform system for the whole of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is now being decided concerns an initial list of certain products with a certain concentration that can be sold only under licence. There is a second list of products with a rule that, if something is suspected, it must be reported as soon as possible. It is therefore very important for national contact points to be set up in every country, where any suspect transaction can be recorded, so that the national governments and the Commission can react as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that Parliament’s proposals on the definition of a suspect transaction have significantly improved the Regulation. We must, after all, be constantly on the alert, and so it is good that the Regulation states that there must be as much consultation as possible between Member States, with Member States and with experts in this field.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If anything in the list has to be amended, and that was a major concession by Parliament, especially as regards the first list, if a new product has to be added or a product removed, that must be done through legislation. Parliament and the Commission would have preferred it to be done through delegated acts, but you cannot have everything, and so Parliament has agreed to let the Council have its way on that point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards changes in concentration, the Commission can still decide on those through delegated acts, and then Parliament and the Council can eventually decide within a certain period whether to approve the proposal or reject it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ammonium nitrate has been discussed at length: we agree that, so far, it comes under the REACH Regulation, but also that the evaluation to be carried out in due course will consider whether it is not better to include that substance in the present Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the approval or the supervision we have agreed on must be by the Member States. We assume that the fines imposed in the various Member States for infringement of this Regulation will be adequate. We hope that, with this Regulation, we are taking a step towards preventing terrorist attacks and other crimes in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think that we are all aware of the threat posed to public safety by terrorists. I do not need to recall the loss of life caused by indiscriminate attacks in recent years. This is a phenomenon which needs to be tackled from a number of angles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we are dealing with one aspect: how to make it more difficult for violent extremists to obtain the ingredients for home-made explosives. The Commission proposed this regulation two years ago. The aim was to put in place harmonised rules, limiting the access of the general public to certain explosive precursors that could be used in the illicit manufacture of explosives. These rules cover the making available of these substances to the public, as well as their possession and use.</p>
      <p sl="en">By acting at EU level, we can guarantee a harmonised approach and create a level playing field for retailers and for the public. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, and the successive Hungarian, Polish, Danish and Cyprus Presidencies for their excellent cooperation in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the agreement reached by co-legislators. The text they have agreed upon will significantly improve our common security and bring tangible European added value. However, there is one institutional point of continued disagreement relating to the preparation of delegated acts, and on this point I would like to make the following declaration on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission takes note of the agreement reached by co-legislators on Article 91, as well as the unanimity in Council; however, it recalls that Article 290 is to be interpreted as meaning that the Commission is autonomous in the preparation and adoption of delegated acts. The Common Understanding agreed between the three institutions is a reflection of that interpretation. Accordingly, reference to consultation of experts should be contained in a recital, not in the enacting terms. The Commission regrets that this principle was not respected and underlines that the present case cannot constitute a precedent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope, however, that tomorrow there will be a positive vote, so that the Council can formally adopt the legislation before the end of the year. The Commission is ready to do its part, notably by issuing guidelines on implementation before the new rules are applied, which means 18 months after the regulation enters into force.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the peaceful summer of 2011, we were all shocked to learn that in Norway – on an island where young people had been gathering – a massacre had been committed, and that the heart of Oslo was also bombed out. According to Europol, one of the reasons why we were able to find the perpetrator was that he had been buying a lot of the chemical materials that can be used to make explosives at home. That is why I welcome our finally coming together in the European Union, in the Member States, and hopefully also in this House tomorrow on this very good proposal from the Commission – thank you, Commissioner Reding – on harmonising the existing rules to prevent such terrible accidents and incidents from happening again.</p>
      <p sl="en">Terrorism and criminality are without borders – are cross-border – while our rules are fragmented and divergent. What is the next step forward? Firstly, at least in most of the Member States, the public will require a licence to be able to buy these explosives – these potential explosives – in a shop or with wholesalers. Secondly, these chemical substances should not be sold above a certain concentration or a certain threshold that would make them suitable for making home-made explosives. Thirdly, this legislation will ensure traceability, which means that economic operators will have to report when these materials have been bought in large quantities. I think we also have a good system for protecting data when these transactions are reported, and it is up to Member States to define what kind of penalties will exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a first step, and in three years’ time the Commission will have to report back on whether there is a need to go further, and whether there is a need to harmonise further. I would invite the Commission to monitor and follow this very closely to see whether the rules that we are now approving are adequate and sufficient to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have struck the right balance between safety and security, which was our primary concern, without adding red tape for companies, for farmers, or for hotels with swimming pools which need to be cleaned with chemicals. I also think that we have struck a balance between reporting and data protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to welcome and thank the shadow rapporteur of the EPP Group, Ms Véronique Mathieu, who is at this time unfortunately attending a very important meeting on criminality in her capacity as coordinator. I would however like to say that she very much enjoyed the cooperation with the rapporteur. We in the EPP Group believe that she has gone the extra mile to show flexibility and to come together with others on what is an extremely important piece of legislation to prevent criminality and terrorism and to protect our citizens in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Jan Mulder, for his strict guidance and perseverance and his cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs throughout the process.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This regulation on the marketing and use of explosives precursors marks a step forward in security for European citizens because it limits and seeks to control access to hazardous substances that can be used to make home-made explosives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, Europe has had a surfeit of terrorist attacks with such home-made bombs. It is therefore astonishing that the Council, in other words our Member States, have taken so long to come to a compromise with the European Parliament to approve this regulation on the basis of the proposal, even though it comes from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">After the Breivik attack in Norway last year, in which a home-made bomb was in fact used, the Council might have been expected to take its citizens’ security more seriously. On the contrary, however, bureaucratic collusion and business interests have held sway. Surprisingly, Germany is the only country that has remained outside, albeit temporarily, a stringent licensing system for purchasing these chemicals that can be used to make home-made bombs on the grounds that its registration system functions very well.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament’s message is clear: priority must be given to citizens’ security. Terrorists exploit our weaknesses, so this regulation must be brought into force as a matter of urgency, and Member States must transpose it into their domestic legislation and adapt their surveillance and security systems to the new European parameters that regulate access to explosives precursors.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This regulation guarantees legitimate justified access to these chemicals, but the aim here is not to protect the right to market and purchase hazardous substances: the ultimate aim of this regulation is to raise the level of security in accessibility to and the use of explosives precursors for criminal purposes, ensuring that they are traceable and that tragedies such as Norway in 2011 or London in 2005 are not repeated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all my compliments to the rapporteur for all his good work on this report. I think it will become clear here what our proper starting point should be in our action against terrorism: instead of poking around in everyone’s everyday lives, I believe – and this is the thrust of this proposal – that we should see the risk of attacks, of criminal activity, where that risk actually arises. That is most certainly where weapons are involved, but also explosives of the kind we are discussing today.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is right to start from here and say that not everyone needs constant and unimpeded access to certain chemicals which can be used for bomb-making; access to them can perfectly well be restricted, just as we restrict access to weapons, and records can be kept. I think it is no big deal to say that anyone buying these substances must also be able to say that they need them for further processing, or at least they must willingly register to use them.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, of course, it must be possible to ensure – as Ms Corazza Bildt says – that certain groups of people do not constantly experience difficulty in buying smaller quantities of these substances for other purposes. Perhaps it is important, too, to ensure that these rules are not applied to everyone across the board, but it is absolutely right to introduce a system of safeguards for these substances; and it is right to press for this and then keep records. Of course it is important to maintain data protection here and, once again, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for incorporating our amendments on data protection. That too is important.</p>
      <p sl="de">To return to my original point: the right thing to do, I believe, is to focus on where the risks arise. I would like to see us do that in other areas too, perhaps by reducing the opportunities for those intent on terrorist or other criminal activity, and being specific and proactive rather than reacting with exaggerated surveillance measures. That is the wrong way. This is a positive example of what to do, so I fully support this proposal as it stands. We members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support this measure and we are glad to see it now nearing completion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as long ago as 2008, the Commission adopted an Action Plan on Enhancing the Security of Explosives. It also established the ‘Standing Committee on Precursors’. That committee identified various explosives precursors that are susceptible to being used to commit terrorist attacks, and it also recommended appropriate action at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Some Member States have accordingly adopted laws or regulations and administrative provisions regarding the placing on the market, making available and possession of certain chemical substances and mixtures that may also be used as explosives precursors. However, these provisions are divergent and are perhaps liable to cause barriers to trade within the European Union. Therefore, we must harmonise the rules. This will enable us to remove distortions of competition, to streamline the free movement of chemical substances and also to ensure a high level of protection and safety for the general public. The Commission’s proposal should restrict the general public’s access to specific substances which, although they are in general use, can be misused as explosives precursors. By limiting public access to substances in legitimate use, it should also reduce the frequency and impact of terrorist attacks. However, in my view, it must be emphasised that, in every case, it is also essential for us to respect the rights of individuals to protection of their privacy. This regulation must be flexible enough to enable us to respond rapidly to changing needs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this regard, it is essential to have a particularly good system for exchanging information between manufacturers and retailers. Specific codes of conduct and various voluntary agreements could also help us. These methods would do a great deal to support the proper functioning of regulatory measures.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, for the security of the EU and its citizens, it is very important that we maintain strict control over substances that can be used in home-made bombs. As you are aware, home-made explosives are the favourite tool of terrorists. In last year’s bomb attack in Oslo, substances of this kind were used, such as ammonium nitrate, which is included in the Annex to the draft regulation. If we are to avoid such tragedies occurring in the EU, we need to take precautions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The sale of dangerous substances to companies or persons without authorisation should be punished much more severely by Member States in order to discourage such practices, and national authorities must always check the licenses issued. Similarly, voluntary reporting of suspicious transactions involving this kind of material will play a very important role in avoiding dangerous situations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an unusual example of the EU recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally, though not necessarily by the EU. The problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that, the longer the process takes, the greater the chance of the purchasers – in this case would-be terrorists – stockpiling the items in advance of the ban.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can remember this proposal first being mentioned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at least a year ago, possibly longer than that, and of course we do not know when the legislation is likely to be passed and come into effect. I think it would have been preferable, initially, to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice, and then to encourage all countries, including Member States, to pass legislation without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UK, for example, it is possible in certain circumstances to pass a law within 24 hours. The procedure in the European Parliament is so long and detailed that it is likely that would-be offenders will already have stockpiled before the legislation is enforced.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The compromise that will be put to the vote tomorrow marks a significant step in the fight against terrorism because it restricts access by the general public to products that can be used as precursors in the manufacture of home-made explosives. Indeed, the regulation identifies the dangerous substances, listed in the annexes, which will be banned to the public beyond specified concentration levels. We want to do our utmost to prevent persons with malicious intentions from having access to these substances. Nonetheless, the framework to be adopted allows some flexibility for normal use of the products concerned, thanks to the exceptions it incorporates. That is why there is provision for the Member States to permit persons who obtain a licence from their relevant authorities to buy such products. Another, more flexible type of control is also envisaged for three products used by the general public as fertiliser or swimming pool cleaner. Finally, retailers will have to notify the competent authorities of any suspicious transactions. These provisions will enhance the safety of European citizens as a result of better monitoring of the purchase, use and possession of explosives precursors on EU territory.</p>

      <p sl="de">It was Paracelsus who said ‘Dosis facit venenum’ – only the dose makes it a poison. The same goes for these precursor substances that can be made into explosives. When substances like hydrogen peroxide, obtainable from pharmacies, are sold, the seller must take special care to ask what the product is to be used for. Instructions on how to make explosives are still easily found on the internet, and they recommend pharmacies as the place to buy the materials. As a result, there is a constant stream of seriously injured youngsters who have paid dearly for their curiosity about explosives; and, in the past, the police have found chemicals bought from pharmacies for illegal homemade explosives intended for use by criminals and/or terrorists. Again, it depends on the dose. If we think how easily pharmacies can be fooled by a large number of people all buying small, unsuspicious quantities for illegal drug manufacture – not to mention the drug smugglers – it is obvious that there is no way of plugging all the loopholes. Here too, then, we cannot have unnecessary interference in people’s private lives in the name of the fight against terrorism.</p>

Wages in our countries are not comparable with wages in the developed economies, and therefore I think that we too – at European Parliament level, in the European Commission and the Council – should start to talk more about the fact that our fellow citizens are living in such a difficult social situation and should also seek solutions in this sensitive area.</p>

I am therefore pleased that this has finally started in Hungary, under the ‘Új nemzedék’ [‘New Generation’] programme. Every young person has a talent within them that is waiting to be discovered and nurtured, and through this they will be able to develop skills that could increase competitiveness in the labour market.

      <p sl="fr">Aurore Martin is a Basque political activist with French nationality, resident in France, against whom Spain issued a European arrest warrant for offences linked to her membership of the Batasuna movement, which is banned in Spain because of alleged links to ETA. As such, Aurore Martin’s activities have been deemed to be linked to a terrorist organisation and are subject to heavy penalties in Spain. By contrast, Batasuna is a party that is authorised in France, and the political activities in question conducted by Ms Aurore Martin are completely legal there. She was recently arrested by the French police and immediately handed over to the Spanish police.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we allow the European Union, whose aim is to improve the freedoms of European citizens, to sanction distortion of the European arrest warrant procedure and reduce political freedoms in Europe to the lowest common denominator? How can we allow Spain and France, by acting in this manner, to endanger the peace process currently under way in the Basque Country?</p>

Bearing in mind the guidelines for colorectal cancer screening from 2010, last week I hosted the conference which launched a White Paper setting the standards for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of colorectal cancer across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">With 450 000 new cases of this cancer being diagnosed every year in the EU, what struck me was the opportunity to reduce the number of new cases. Speakers confirmed the possibility of reducing new cases by 30 % by embracing a lifestyle of healthy food, exercise and not smoking. Screening can identify a further 30 %. Such initiatives could prevent about 270 000 new cases per year. I therefore ask the Commission to urge the implementation of a local primary health strategy, to embrace a healthy lifestyle, awareness campaigns and the early introduction of screening programmes across Europe so that we can meet our goals of healthy ageing by 2020.</p>

Her crime consists in having participated in Spain in meetings of the Batasuna party, a party that is illegal in Spain but legal in France where it even has some elected representatives. She is the subject of a European arrest warrant that has been enforced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the establishment of the European arrest warrant in 2004 was greeted as the first step towards a European area of security and justice, today there are differences in its implementation that create inequalities between citizens of the European Union, and that is contrary to the very spirit of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, where there are important political implications, as in the case of this Basque activist, shouldn’t the European arrest warrant include broader exceptions and not be issued automatically so as to provide a better guarantee of fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which has been prejudiced in the case of Aurore Martin?</p>

This unfortunately caused an overflowing of banks and flooding, major damage in Slovenia and additional threats below the dams.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the anti-popular policy of the EU monopolies and the governments of the Member States is aimed against the minimal labour and social rights remaining to the working class and the popular strata. It does away with the universality of the national general collective labour agreement, and now the minimum wages are set by law, by the governments. The results are mass unemployment, starvation wages and pensions, an increase in the pension age; destruction of state social security, health and welfare systems; poverty, misery and a living hell for the working class and the popular strata.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 17 November 2012, the PSL, the Polish People’s Party, held its 11th Congress. The PSL is a party with an almost 120-year-old history. It arose in a context of opposition and the struggle for freedom and national independence, fighting to improve the living conditions of large numbers of Poles, mainly in the provinces and rural areas. The Polish people’s movement has always put human beings at the centre of its concerns: their living conditions, access to work and education, and equal rights for all.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our movement was constantly involved in the struggle and campaign for independent Polish statehood. Poland achieved independence in 1918. In 1920, when the Red Army advanced on our country with the aim of conquering not only Poland but the whole of Europe, it was Poland that halted the dangerous westward march of the Soviet Army. The prime minister at the time was the famous populist activist Wincenty Witos, who was three times prime minister in the Polish Government. During the Second World War, the populist movement formed its own army, the Peasant Battalions, numbering over 160 000 troops. When Poland found itself, after the Second World War, in the Eastern bloc as a result of the Yalta agreements, the People’s Party fought for freedom and democracy under the leadership of Stanisław Mikołajczyk. Now, for the past five years, we have been active partners in a coalition government with the Civic Platform, and the newly elected authorities have announced that the PSL will continue to play an active part in the work of the European People’s Party and the Polish Parliament.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the card payment market in Europe has high potential for savings and expansion, to say nothing of the potential for mobile and internet payments.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I support the Commission’s view that various payment methods should be promoted, made more secure and more user-friendly. The predominant focus in my own-initiative report is on card payments because I do not think it sensible to impose unnecessarily strict regulation on the mobile and internet payment markets at this stage: the markets are still developing and taking shape, and we cannot predict the payment innovations that the markets will develop over the coming months and years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The reliability and cost-effectiveness of card, internet and mobile payments are also key to growth of European e-commerce and to the operation of the Digital Single Market. Factors associated with payment security should not have overriding importance, and we must not overemphasise security at the cost of user-friendliness because otherwise the payment systems will not attract users. Similarly we should note that the use of cash is not fully secure either.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One key topic in the preparation of the report was the cost of using payment cards. When the Commission outlines the next steps in the development of payment markets, I hope that, in the name of diversity, it will also consider the costs involved in the use of cash and cheques. When preparing this report, we have discussed Multilateral Interchange Fees, or ‘MIFs’. MIFs are, in some cases, too high in relation to the costs they engender, and they can sometimes obstruct competition.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There are currently no alternative financial models for card payment schemes, and for that reason we cannot, in my view, prohibit the existing business model. It is absolutely vital for the Commission to produce a basic impact assessment before we propose action in relation to MIFs, whether we propose restricting MIFs, gradually reducing them to zero or banning them completely. If we decided to try and ban MIFs, we would run the risk that the cost of maintaining the card scheme would be transferred directly to the card-holder, the consumer, in the form of a charge that might result in a decline in the use of payment cards contrary to the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that operators other than banks will gain a foothold in the payment market. I do not, however, support third-party access to a customer’s banking information before the security and operation of the scheme can be fully safeguarded.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, when seeking to achieve harmonised technical standards, the basic principle must be to ensure that standardisation removes barriers rather than giving rise to new barriers or to difficulties for market operators. This report is a natural continuation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project: cross-border payments should be as easy as credit transfers in the SEPA area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European payments market needs to function as efficiently and accurately as possible. It is still far from reaching its maximum potential, and there are still obstacles that need to be removed. Card, internet or mobile payment can offer consumers a number of advantages. They benefit from faster, more flexible and convenient payment systems. There are still big differences in paying by card from one Member State to another, and markets remain fragmented.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Single Euro Payments Area will eliminate the existing discrepancies. It will help transform the market, making it more innovative and competitive. Yet the question remains: how secure are these systems in countries with no previous experience of them and where the risk of fraud persists? I think that a high level of security needs to be ensured, as a guarantee against the risk of fraud.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the development and large-scale use of card, internet and mobile payment will enable e-commerce to develop in Europe. To facilitate cross-border e-commerce and to guarantee a true digital economy, it is essential to develop transparent, secure and effective payment systems on the European digital market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Standardisation and interoperability requirements should focus on improving the competitiveness, transparency, innovativeness, payment security and efficiency of the European payments market. I consider that more transparency is needed, together with better information for consumers about the surcharges and supplementary fees that apply to the various payment methods, given that sellers often include the transaction costs in the price of their products and services, so that consumers are not informed appropriately in advance about the total cost.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 24 May 2012, multilateral interchange fees can be considered to be anti-competitive. How does the Commission intend to implement this judgment?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to highlight one particular article in this report – Article 32. It says that it is likely that more and more companies in Europe will be dependent on having access to credit card payments and it urges the Commission to come up with objective rules to say under what circumstances the big payment providers – Visa, MasterCard and PayPal – may reject a business. This came up in the context of the Wikileaks affair, when the same three big payment services decided to close down a whistleblowers’ website based in Iceland – inside the European Economic Area – because of political pressure from the US. But we also saw only last week that there has been quite a lot of talk in the media about Visa, MasterCard and PayPal deciding to close down a small shop that was selling horror movies simply because they do not like horror movies. I understand that they have now since changed their opinion on that, but it illustrates the problem and I hope the Commission will look seriously at this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, whilst cash and invoiced payments remain popular in Europe, the new technologies mean that more and more people are paying using their mobile phones. Therefore, as we know, the credit industry and mobile network operators have developed a range of systems to make wallets and cheque cards redundant.</p>
      <p sl="de">If people are sceptical, it is primarily on grounds of security, and rightly so, because bank details and passwords are prime targets for the cybercriminals. It is well known that Android smart phones are easy to hack into. There is already enough abuse going on when people have purchases charged to their phone bills. Therefore it is no wonder that irresponsible firms use complicated tricks and totally circumvent consumer safeguards in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">As mobile payments become more common, the EU must thus work for greater security through better consumer protection; it must also, I think, look at appropriate data protection.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the aim and content of the report are to be welcomed by all means. In the markets of emerging and developing countries, where bank-card payments, for example, are not yet widespread enough, it is important that the interbank commission strategy concentrates on stimulating the issue side properly. Real efforts must be made to achieve the praiseworthy, ambitious goals conceived in the report as far as card, internet and mobile payments are concerned, but, in any event, the characteristics of the Member States must be taken into consideration during regulation. They must be examined and evaluated individually and thoroughly, for example in the case of re-regulating the interbank commission strategy. In my view, the strategy on the size of the commission must be developed in such a way that, in any event, it promotes growth in the market for payments of this type. In other words, what this means to me is that the strategy must, in any case, be adapted to the level of development and maturity of the relevant payment market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Commission’s Green Paper on the integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments points out several barriers which prevent the European payment market from working as efficiently and openly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European market for these types of payments is fragmented both across and within national borders. Standardisation in this area should be directed at defining security standards and should include the measures that are necessary to ensure a more open, transparent and innovative – but also competitive – electronic payments market that brings advantages to all consumers. The existence of a neutral and safe European single market for these types of payments, facilitating free competition and innovation, is even more essential from the point of view of achieving a genuine single digital market. Electronic payments are also playing an important role in the fight against the grey economy and against tax evasion. A uniform European Union legal framework in this area must be directed especially at a higher level of protection for the consumer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, virtual transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to save time and effort for users, but their security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigilant. The vulnerability of virtual transaction systems consists of two main factors: firstly, technical vulnerabilities due to the fact that virtual transactions still represent a new online practice and, secondly, the human ignorance factor. Many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information online and into making unsecure transactions with third-party entities. That is why I think the most important measures which should be taken are: raising user awareness regarding internet transaction security; respecting the recommendations of SecuRe Pay; and last but not least, achieving total transparency of costs for users and the freedom to choose preferred payment methods.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, Commissioner, I would also like to insist on a particular point, which is that of interbank commission payments – especially multilateral ones. Today there are quite considerable differences from one country to another, and sometimes in fact these sums are very high. This represents, as a primary effect, a penalisation of the users and hence consumers, but it also becomes an objective obstacle to developing the market. For this reason, I believe it is very important to consider harmonising these commission payments without delay and then progressively doing away with them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I absolutely agree with the discussion and with the speeches by Members saying that payments are one of the most common expressions of the single market for its 500 million citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a very rapidly evolving field and it is important that Europe supports the developments providing for simplicity and safety and guaranteeing the best value for payment services used by the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, a lot has been done but we need to go forward, as underlined in the report by Mr Terho, who supports the objectives of the Green Paper and who also argues for a more integrated payment market. This integration was taken forward by the regulations establishing a deadline for the migration to a single Europe payment area for credit transfers and direct debits. Thanks to that, from 2014 on there will be no difference between national and cross-border payments any more.</p>
      <p sl="en">But a true and integrated internal market in payments must also involve payments by credit card, internet and mobile phone, as underlined by the speakers: we need choice for consumers; we need innovation safety to free up the potential of e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="en">You know that we do have problems with e-commerce at this moment, because only 35 % of internet users shop online because of problems related to payments. Therefore there are clearly specific problems to be solved.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we must defragment the payment services markets, which are far too often national. We must facilitate the access of new entrants and significantly increase the transparency of the cost of the different payment methods. We need to address issues of standardisation, interoperability, security of payments, data protection and the good governance of the system.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are currently working on all these issues, such as the multilateral interchange fees, surcharges, governance and standardisation, as well as account access and security, and we will need to find the right balance. It will doubtless involve changing the regulatory framework of the directive on payment services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur’s report is a milestone in this debate. It constitutes a good basis for the work that we will carry out together to achieve a well-functioning digital single market beneficial to consumers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">More and more EU citizens are making payments by means of payment cards, the internet or portable payment devices, and this is giving rise to constant expansion of the electronic commerce sector. To support competitiveness, it is essential to eliminate differences between domestic and cross-frontier payments, which, at the present time, are hidden or inflated in many cases. It has become especially important to prevent imitation of the dishonest practices of certain economic players, consisting in the multiple charging of the cost of credit card transactions where a number of purchases are effected through a single payment transaction (my question of 26 October 2010 – E-8649/2010), as in the case of airlines. It has also become necessary to standardise and unify the operation of payment terminals so that they cater for all types of card.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Increasing the confidence of payers, who must be persuaded that their electronic transactions are secure, is a separate but equally important issue requiring attention. Consumers opting for a cashless form of payment must be guaranteed protection of their personal data and the security of data concerning their bank transactions. The development of a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) requires the continuous removal of a series of barriers to operation of the European payments market set out in the European Commission’s Green Paper.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is a short presentation of the report (A7-0354/2012) by Saïd El Khadraoui on shadow banking [2012/2115(INI)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-141-000" speaker_id="25718" name="Saïd El Khadraoui" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on shadow banking comes at a well-chosen moment. Only yesterday, the Financial Stability Board formulated its conclusions and recommendations on the shadow banking approach. In many respects, these are actually similar to those on which you will be voting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In fact, the shadow banking phenomenon covers a whole range of very different forms of credit arrangement outside the conventional banking sector, and it is therefore not subject to the same rules. As the name suggests, it involves complex, often opaque financial activities not sufficiently overseen by anyone, or any institution or supervisory authority. That does not mean that forms of shadow banking could not contribute to the financing of the real economy and consequently not be described as positive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, though, the conventional banking sector and shadow banking are clearly linked in various ways. Secondly, we know that systemic risks can potentially arise, which, furthermore, have also played a part in the development of the financial crisis, and that there is also a shift towards forms of shadow banking in order to avoid oversight and regulation of the conventional banking sector. Thirdly, it is a very large and growing phenomenon, which is estimated to encompass 25 % to 30 % of the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For all those reasons, appropriate instruments need to be created to give the authorities an overview of the phenomenon, in order to be able to evaluate the risks and take action if necessary. Ideally, we will manage to encourage instruments that stimulate the real economy and can contribute to economic growth without causing excessive risks and to keep tight control over more speculative or risky forms.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is therefore the subject of my report, and I thank all my colleagues and especially the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable cooperation, leading to a number of conclusions which are widely supported. I shall not mention them all in detail, but the most urgent seems to me to be the need for monitoring, the mapping of financial flows.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Supervisory authorities should have at least a general picture of the scale of repo transactions and all forms of encumbrance or clawback arrangements entered into by institutions. Hence the idea of recording information in a trade repository. There should also be a sort of central EU database of repo transactions. Common rules must be devised for reporting on transactions relating to principal, interest rate, collateral, haircuts, tenor, counterparties and the like. There is also a need for a complete overview of risk transfers by financial institutions in the form of a central register.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In fact, what it comes down is that we need to be able to find an answer to simple questions such as ‘who has to do what to whom and when and at what price?’ Also, the conventional banking sector has to be protected by setting a limit on exposure to shadow banks, and shadow banking initiated by banks must be included in the balance sheet and consolidated. As regards securitisation, stricter rules have to be applied in order to encourage quality products, and consideration needs to be given to imposing a limit on the number of times a financial product can be securitised.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, a number of recommendations are being put forward for certain specific funds such as money market funds and exchange traded funds to ensure greater transparency and limit potential risks to the system.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, the ball is now in the court of the G20 and the Commission. It is obvious that we can devise a good response only with an overall global approach. It now depends on the institutions and regions concerned reorganising in the next few months so that a light can finally be shone on the part of the financial world that has, until now, been too obscure. That is an absolute must if we want to avoid another financial crisis in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We await the proposals from the Commission, which will be presenting a communication. We look forward to receiving them and then a number of very concrete steps will be taken, which we as a Parliament will, of course, scrutinise closely.</p>

    <intervention id="1-143-000" speaker_id="96998" name="Evelyn Regner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are happy to see Commissioner Hahn with us in today’s plenary. Now to the matter in hand, though: before the crisis began, it was quite usual for the banking regulations to be circumvented. Financial activities were increasingly moved to less tightly regulated arenas – to shadow banks. All in all, we have 1 400 of these establishments, a huge number of these establishments which have gone bust. None of them had any importance to the system individually; but collectively the loss to the European economy was huge, and it rocked the financial system to its foundations. This selective regulation of banks must be stopped if we want, in future, to plug the loopholes exploited by the wide boys of the money markets. We do want to, and we need to do it fast.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many shadow banks receive state aid, but act without any state oversight – all the more reason to regulate them. The central registry mentioned by Mr El Khadraoui should be the basis for doing that. However, we also need caps on third-party capital holdings, liquidity buffers and capital charges.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too commend this initiative, which aims to improve the monitoring and regulation of shadow banking. It will enable prudential considerations and those related to the conduct of the market to be addressed appropriately, through stricter supervision. We need to have an overall picture that would enable trends in this sector to be identified, and there is a need for close international cooperation to this end. We must take account both of the positive aspects, and of the risks and factors that need to be remedied.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, I would stress the importance of eliminating incorrect practices and reducing systemic risk. This is the only way to achieve a high level of transparency and to increase the safety and stability of the financial system, and we will be able to feel the positive effects of shadow banking too, in the real economy and on stimulating economic development.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a phenomenon which, over the past few years, has become vastly more widespread, with potential advantages for the economy and, to be honest, large risks and high levels of damage to many people and many families who have been affected by an activity which is not always controlled and who have been attracted by supposed advantages which have never actually materialised.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that it is very important, in the first place, to learn about the phenomenon and then to take control, step by step, of its natural development. Thus, the monitoring of transactions is one of the central points and perhaps the most delicate and important question; for it is odd that we are undertaking a discussion, albeit a useful one, on banking supervision by the European Central Bank and, at the same time, we are not taking sufficient account of actual phenomena that are going on and which penalise consumers.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, this subject could not be more topical, since it comes at the same time as the regulation of bank capital requirements, the development of banking supervision and the practical implementation of the European Semester. The European Union is clearly making an effort to evaluate the reasons behind the financial crisis that has developed so as to avoid or prepare for any financial events in the future. We must pay attention to ensuring that shadow banks operate in a transparent manner that does not cause systemic risks in the future. It is common knowledge that, although their activities may stimulate trade and act as a stimulus for liquidity flow, they are also capable of causing great damage at the same time, in the absence of a protection network for the traditional banking system. In actual fact, the key is to take precautions and to prevent shadow banking based on hedge funds, money-market funds and investment instruments from threatening European banks and exposing money markets to systemic risk. The goal is clear; we still have time to develop the means.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, shadow banking as such takes place via entities or financial contracts generating a combination of bank-like functions but outside the regulatory perimeter or under a regulatory regime that is either insufficiently thorough or addresses issues other than systemic risks. Regulated entities in the regular banking system take part extensively in those activities defined as part of the shadow banking system, and are, in many ways, interconnected with shadow banking entities. Estimates suggest that the size of the global shadow banking system in 2011 was approximately EUR 51 billion. This represents up to 30 % of the total financial system and half of total bank assets. Moreover, shadow banking has been identified as one of the main possible triggers or factors contributing to the financial crisis, and can threaten the stability of the financial system. Therefore, we need complete oversight of shadow banking.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank in particular Mr El Khadraoui who coordinated this report, but also other Members for an important contribution to the debate and for emphasising that regulators should not forget some actors and entities commonly designated under the term ‘shadow banking sector’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The views expressed in the Parliament report are in line with the Commission’s concerns and the objectives: firstly, to strengthen the resilience capacities of the global financial sector and, secondly, to reduce regulatory arbitrage possibilities. I am glad to share these concerns with you. Your concrete request to act reinforces our willingness to keep these issues very high on the Commission’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">What do we mean by shadow banking? Shadow banking comprises financial entities or activities which carry out credit intermediation activities outside the regulated sector. In practice, risks linked to these activities were observed in 2008, when special purpose vehicles were purchased and then securitised illiquid assets and subprime mortgages were converted into assets such as collateralised debt obligations. These assets were bought by many investors worldwide and then turned out to be worthless and illiquid. Unfortunately, we all now know the consequences of such strategies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why should regulators focus on the shadow banking sector? Firstly, this sector constitutes a very large amount of financial activities. The FSB has roughly estimated the size of global shadow banking at around EUR 46 trillion in 2010 having increased from EUR 21 trillion in 2002. Secondly, the sector is highly interlinked with the regulated sector and especially with banks. Potential contagion effects are high and could materialise very quickly, with an impact on the whole economy. For instance, when money market funds suffered from financial pressures, they suddenly had to stop the investments in short instruments issued by banks and non-financial corporations. As a result, there was a credit crunch in this market. Finally, at the same time that regulators are strongly strengthening potential rules for banks – CRR, CRD 4 – it would be highly undesirable to keep some actors or entities outside the supervisory oversight. I would directly generate regulatory arbitrage opportunities and give incentives for financial entities to develop risky activities in less regulated areas of shadow banking.</p>
      <p sl="en">For all these reasons the Commission drafted a Green Paper on shadow banking to identify the appropriate measures to regulate these risks in Europe. It is key to working in a consistent way with our G20 and Financial Stability Board partners, while adjusting our work to specific European issues. The European Systemic Risk Board contribution to this debate will be very helpful for the Commission, as well as all the contributions to the Green Paper that have been received.</p>
      <p sl="en">In early 2013, the Commission will present a roadmap on shadow banking in the EU focusing on three priorities: firstly, the strengthening of transparency and data collection and monitoring; secondly, money market funds, and, thirdly, strengthening policies in the field of repo and securities lending transactions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank Parliament for its support, through this excellent report, for the Commission’s work to strengthen our financial sector, to reduce systemic risk and to reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. I understand your request that the Commission acts on the shadow banking sector. This is a clear signal and we will act on it in the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, 23 years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the internet is becoming the new frontier at which the rights of minors have to be protected and promoted, given the growing penetration of the internet among children and adolescents in Europe – a kind of symbiotic relationship which helps to form their personalities and the way in which they relate to the outside world.</p>
      <p sl="it">A few years ago, the average age at which children had their first access to the internet was around 9 years old, but today, the first steps on the web, for those born in the digital age, are being taken even before they learn to read or write. Young people under 16 use computers for study, play, watching video clips, downloading videos and music, file sharing, and for visiting chat rooms, blogs and virtual worlds. However, the majority of children between the ages of 9 and 16 have their profile registered on a social network, many using a fictitious identity, and a quarter of adolescents declare an older age than their real one. Twelve per cent of those in the 9 to 16 age group report that they have been harassed, in particular by being bullied (40 %) and by content and approaches of a sexual nature (25 %).</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, opportunities and threats coexist on the internet; nowadays the internet is indispensable for the integration of children from a social, educational and work point of view, but the European institutions and the Member States must do their utmost to ensure that minors are guaranteed the conditions they need for their education and to keep themselves informed, the rules required for safe navigation, and that providers, business and educators are made aware of their responsibilities. The report proposes a holistic approach in respect of the promotion and protection of the rights of children online.</p>
      <p sl="it">Exchanges with the various political groups in the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs – whom I would like to thank – allowed us to arrive at a compromise text which was highly satisfactory even though it deals with a topic about which there are different sensibilities and trends. The work carried out with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, Ms Hedh, made a significant contribution. The report welcomes and incorporates – with precise recommendations – the recent communication from the Commission for a better internet for children.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was our aim to strike a balance between the fundamental rights of the child in the digital world, the right to access to education, the right to protection and the right to digital citizenship, in a new system of governance which puts at its heart, as paramount, the interests of the child, as a person undergoing education and as a European citizen, on the basis of Article 24 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Where governance is concerned, we call on the Commission to mainstream children’s rights across all the policies of the European Union that refer to the internet, to continue to finance specific programmes such as the Safer Internet Programme on the basis of a report and monitoring, and to take appropriate measures, through the internet among other things, which make it possible to coordinate the implementation of codes of conduct and the CEO coalition initiative. In addition, we support the Commission’s proposal to take legislative action if the adoption of the current codes of self-regulation should fail.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards safe and untroubled access to internet use, we propose taking measures for an educational alliance among families, schools, associations and those involved in media and audiovisual services, to integrate these skills in school curricula and to train trainers and adults; vigilance in respect of the online marketing and publicising of harmful substances; an exchange of good practice in the role of informal education by the dissemination among adolescents of positive and good practices on the internet; the access of minors to safe and high-quality pluralistic digital content in educational programmes and services and, in particular, in the public service media.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the right to protection, the report makes a clear distinction between illegal content and unsuitable and dangerous content. For the dangerous and unsuitable material, we call for action to protect identity and privacy; to prevent excessively early contact with sexuality, grooming and improper behaviour – including that towards other minors, such as online bullying and sexting. Furthermore, we call on the Commission to maintain the initiative for classifying unsuitable content and, in general, for all the technical innovations that guide parents and children; we support the proposal from Ms Reding on the protection of personal data, privacy, the right to be forgotten, with specific measures for minors, and with mandatory parental consent for the processing of their data.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards illegal content, however, there must be tools which are effective in dealing with online crimes such as grooming, and we would repeat that such crimes are of a cross-border nature and so stronger international cooperation is required in dealing with computer crime and in supporting hotlines. Finally, we would encourage – and we call on the Commission to encourage – the Member States to give whatever support they can to digital citizenship, which is crucial for the development of an intelligent and inclusive Union and civic participation, including that on the internet, by minors.</p>

But at the same time, they are very exposed to risks such as grooming, mobbing, violence and pornography, and they are vulnerable consumers. That is why I very much welcome the comprehensive and deep approach to dealing with protection of children on the internet taken by Silvia Costa, the rapporteur, and welcome the fact that my points, which deal with the industry’s shared responsibility and the value of self-regulation, as well as the importance of moderate and responsible advertising, have been included, and I hope they will be supported.</p>

      <p sl="en">This might have been a good opportunity for Parliament to criticise the fact that private parties are increasingly taking responsibility for what can and cannot be broadcast to users online.

In voting on the report by Ms Costa, whose work in the Committee on Culture and Education I greatly appreciate, we have to make just such a choice between freedom and security, between freedom to search the internet, freedom of movement in the digital world, and the safety of our children. It is not an easy choice. I understand the last speaker, because she is clearly conscious of the danger, but our duty is to warn or protect children in the Member States of the European Union against the threats of which Ms Costa speaks: against sexual abuse, against the loss of self in a virtual world, against addiction to that world. For that reason, I think the report deserves support.</p>

Moreover, we must not underestimate the presence of child pornography websites, which can put at risk the lives of the very youngest, and of people who try to lure minors.</p>

On the one hand, we need, of course, to appreciate that this is a completely new form of communication available to the new generation right from the start, but, on the other hand, we really must take a critical approach to the dangers. We must not forget that young people are often living in an unreal world here, that communication operates on the most trivial level and that children are often at risk of developing a kind of addictive behaviour. There is abuse, of course, bullying and all manner of other dangers. I therefore believe there is a real need for something like self-policing by the providers, and perhaps something like age restrictions or restrictions on the amount of data one can download.

      <p sl="de">To my mind, point 24 of the report is especially important. This says that any such measures should be fully compatible with the rule of law and with legal certainty, take account of the rights of end-users, and comply with existing legal and judicial procedures, as well as with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Specifically now, when we see all the time that measures taken by the industry are voluntary, we MEPs must keep working to ensure that these voluntary measures do not mean that the proper legislative process is circumvented.

      <p sl="de">How are parents, who had very little education in matters digital during their own childhood, now to tell their children what is right and proper? Perhaps they need to educate themselves a little more on the subject, and perhaps we should tell the older generation how things might be improved.

The internet has become an inseparable part of our everyday lives, and unfortunately that is also the case for our children. Although practical measures have already been adopted, in 1998 and 2006, for the protection of minors online, children are still exposed to various risks. These risks often bring with them not only physical harm to children but also significant financial consequences for their parents. Statistics clearly show that children who go online easily become victims – first and foremost of sexual assault, bullying, or commercial or other misuse of their profiles.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is shocking how some firms unhesitatingly exploit the ignorance and inexperience of these minors for their own profit and commercial ends.

Small children see their parents working with computers at home; better-equipped schools offer older children additional practical classes or education online. Through the internet, children can get to meet and communicate with people of their own age, not only in their own towns, but practically all over the world. For the younger generation, internet culture cannot be avoided. Therefore, we must attempt to shape rules for operating internet portals, so that the virtual world our children enter is civilised, decent, interesting, entertaining and inspiring. These resources are difficult to control, but if we keep taking an active approach to modelling the digital world and can manage to eliminate the risks that arise, we may create an effective, rich tool for the personal development of the coming generation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission would like to congratulate Ms Costa on her important report. It is in line with the European strategy to create a better internet for children, which was set up recently by the Commission to combine a series of instruments based on legislation, self-regulation and financial support. Educating and protecting our children is a top priority and it is essential to find this balance also in the online world, ensuring that children and adults can be safe while getting the most out of digital opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament is indeed on the same wavelength. First of all, the Commission agrees on the importance given by the report to digital literacy and skills for children, since these will improve their job perspectives and help them become confident digital citizens. The report also encourages the provision of access to safe and quality digital content, which is another pillar of the new European strategy, since this will benefit both children and the development of the digital single market. Furthermore, the Commission would also like to emphasise that the Audiovisual Media Services Directive adopted in 2007 contains specific provisions to protect children in regard to audiovisual commercial communications.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also welcomes the recognition given to the role of Member States to enhance media education. We will continue to support the identification and exchange of best practices in the areas of formal and informal education, in particular through the network of Safer Internet Centres.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to ensure that the ICT industry takes children’s needs into account and implements the right measures in their products. In this context, self-regulation is a key instrument. That is why my colleague Ms Kroes invited key CEOs last year to join a coalition to make the internet a better place for children through concrete actions on areas which are mentioned in your report: reporting harmful content, age-appropriate privacy settings, content classification, parental controls and take-down of child sexual abuse material. Past sectoral self-regulatory agreements have shown that the signatory companies have made progress in the area of child protection. But there is still room for improvement and we are looking forward to seeing the outcomes of that coalition, expected in the coming month.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also well aware of the importance of fighting child sexual abuse material. We are committed through the European strategy to further enhancing cooperation with law enforcement, hotlines and ISPs to improve the process of notice and action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Commission is committed to the launching and functioning of a global alliance against child sexual abuse online as a means of sustaining national efforts to improve identification and assistance for child victims, prosecution of offenders, prevention of crimes and reducing the availability of child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission welcomes your support for future funding for a safer internet. This funding through the proposed Connecting Europe Facility will be vital to developing sustainable infrastructures to deliver better internet with high-quality content for children, while boosting growth and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To do so, we must work closer together towards the common goal of achieving a better internet for children: a safe place, but also somewhere that young European citizens can enjoy while having the skills and awareness to make the most out of it.</p>

Most young people highlight the positive opportunities offered by the internet, which they say are satisfactory, however there remain large numbers of inexperienced and naive web surfers, among whom minors, who when navigating lack certain awareness, protection and control. While parental control has, in many cases, proven to be a useful tool, it remains only partially effective on the internet and on electronic commutation networks. Similarly, across the European Union, Member States have continued to work to eliminate such gaps in protection and control for minors and have produced laws and have encouraged self-regulation. EU funding has paved the way for tools such as the Safer Internet Programme now well established in all the countries of the Union. In spite of this, Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union argues that policies for children are holistic. The importance of safeguarding minors should be at the very top of our priority list and thus I believe a broader framework directive is needed to encourage closer coordination between Member States and the EU.</p>

Member States and the Commission therefore need to support and launch awareness-raising campaigns targeting children, parents and educators in order to provide the information necessary for the protection against cybercrime, as well as to encourage them to report suspicious websites and online behaviour. It would also be beneficial if authorities would reach agreements with content providers and server hosts to repel illegal or threatening activities in mainstream online media, most typically in social networks.

Unfortunately, progress in every sector brings with it many drawbacks and risks, and online services are no exception. However, we must exercise care in distinguishing content. There is a difference between illegal and inappropriate content: inappropriate content may not be illegal and, equally, ‘legal’ may not mean ‘appropriate’. The greatest danger on the internet is during communication between individual users, where dangerous individuals may be hiding behind the high level of anonymity. These problems threaten not just children and young people, but all users. Therefore, I support the motion put forward by Ms Costa, which emphasises the introduction of education about safety in ICT use and about contact with potentially risky content.</p>

      <p sl="ro">European children spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television. They are online 88 minutes a day (2 hours for 15/16-year-olds), starting on average at 9 years of age, but in some very precocious cases, even before they start schooling and reading.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, children are exposed to enormous risks, such as psychological manipulation, child pornography, violation of privacy, online gambling, commercial fraud, conduct that can have a number of consequences, such as cyber bullying and sexting, and other content unsuitable for their age, such as inappropriate advertising, violence, sex, etc., which can cause fear and anxiety.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is our responsibility to defend children’s innocence and to protect them from the dangers to which they may be exposed as a result of access to the internet or television. It is necessary to ensure continuity for the Safer Internet Programme, and to encourage action to combat online crime against minors, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States, facilitating information exchange with internet service providers and e-mail service providers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The internet is a phenomenon of today’s world, and already we cannot imagine life without it. However, although it brings advantages, we must also be aware that it poses threats to vulnerable groups including – and especially – children and young people. Abuse of trust or even just ill-considered use of the internet may culminate in cyber bullying, sexual harassment or harm to health. In using online tools, children look for support to their parents, who must take an active interest in the threat posed by cyber space. Therefore, parents represent a key element in protecting children from online risks, and they must try to make sure the internet is on their children’s side, not a danger to them. To this end, if parents are to be able to help children, they must have sufficient information. The problem of dangers arising for our children online cannot be solved by prohibition. The road to success is cooperation between all the interested players, parents, educational institutions, civil society and, not least, business. At the same time, we must create a comprehensive legal framework at European level that will ensure the protection of children in the digital age.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I greatly welcome the draft resolution on protecting children in the digital world. It is very important, in view of the dangers to children and young people arising from uncontrolled access to new technologies, mainly the internet but computer games as well, that we endeavour to look at the problem as a whole and to encourage Member States’ governments and the European Commission, as well as internet administrators, to take effect action to protect minors on the web.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The entry into service of national hotlines and contact points as ‘safety buttons’, the launch of an information campaign for parents on the threats to their children posed by dangerous digital content, and finally the creation of a new cyber security agency, are certainly steps in the right direction and should be firmly supported. I would therefore fervently urge the Commission permanently to monitor standards for the protection of children against dangers in the digital world and to encourage Member States’ governments to improve and strengthen the legal safeguards in force in this area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Preventive action, through education about norms of conduct, plays an essential role in training children to make decisions about their online activity. The perception that children form for themselves about what is normal and acceptable for society is highly important. The way they perceive the use of digital media is important so that, in the future, they will be able to decide for themselves which paths they want to follow on the internet and which ones they prefer to avoid. Because an attitude is defined as a predisposition that forms over time and which is used to judge a context, a young person’s attitude to the internet forms over time and is very likely to be the result of the attitudes of friends, family or teachers to this medium.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I commend the idea of a campaign aimed at parents to help them understand the digital content their children are handling, and especially ways to protect them. I also find very useful the advice given to Member States and the Commission to conduct information campaigns to protect against IT crime. International cooperation between legal authorities should be strengthened, as should the work of civil society organisations involved in combating and monitoring online activities harmful to minors.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a society I feel strongly that it is our duty to protect our children and young people from harmful material that is so freely accessible on the internet. The material that I am referring to is that which was highlighted in Ms Costa’s report referring to that of strong connotations of violence, discrimination, sexism, and racism. This type of material has long been statistically proven to have negative as well as adverse effects on children. Thus, I feel that it is our responsibility to try to prevent exposure of such material to young people. It is my opinion that we cannot do this alone as legislatures but we must enlist the assistance of parents, schools and the communities in which these children live. In saying that I would like to emphasise that the internet is a viable and necessary tool in which children can learn from and explore, in fact there may very well be children watching us online as we are working now to protect them. Therefore it must be said that while we are putting energy in to safeguarding the internet for children just as much energy should be put into the positive side as well.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0343/2012) by Birgit Collin-Langen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the implementation of the Consumer Credit Directive [2012/2003(INI)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-184-000" speaker_id="112788" name="Birgit Collin-Langen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report deals with implementation of the Consumer Credit Directive. Parliament adopted this in 2008 by an overwhelming majority, and it deals essentially with loans of EUR 200 to EUR 75 000. It has two basic objectives: firstly, simplification of Member States’ laws on consumer credit and, secondly, better and comparable information on credit, with the aim of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and strengthening the internal market in cross-border consumer credit.</p>
      <p sl="de">The definitive harmonisation of some key aspects of credit law has significantly raised the level of consumer protection in Europe. However, there has been little increase in the cross-border take-up of consumer credit: less than 2 %, with 20 % of it done online. This may be because only very few financial institutions offer cross-border consumer credit and because the market as a whole has been in decline in recent years as a result of the financial crisis. Also, it seems that the lack of any personal relationship with the financial institution concerned, rather than legal considerations, has discouraged the take-up of cross-border consumer credit.</p>
      <p sl="de">The transposition deadline of two years was a particular problem. The procedure is very complex and involved both national legislators and financial institutions. The time allowed was perhaps too short; in future, it would be preferable to set a three-year transposition deadline.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some of the Directive’s provisions were substantively challenged. For example, the standard information sheet providing the consumer with precontractual information. The information sheet was criticised as too detailed, difficult to understand. Another example was calculation of the annual percentage rate of charge. The Commission has put forward guidelines on this, but they are not legally binding.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be desirable for the provisions on calculating the annual percentage rate of charge to be applied uniformly in all relevant EU legal instruments. Lastly, I should mention the period allowed for consumers to withdraw. The issue of when the withdrawal period starts to run was problematical.</p>
      <p sl="de">The existence of problems in transposing the Directive was identified by the Commission in its 2011 review of 562 consumer credit websites (SWEEP). Summing up, one can say that the Directive is a significant factor in consumer protection in Europe. The Commission should now review the way the Directive has been transposed and urge the Member States to apply it correctly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stakeholders should then be given time to get used to the new rules and gain experience of the way they are applied. Thereafter a detailed assessment should be carried out of the legal and practical impact of the Directive and, on that basis, consideration given to what amendments, if any, are required.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those were the main points of my report. A total of 29 amendments were tabled. At this point, may I thank the shadow rapporteur most warmly for the frank and, to my mind, very fair and open discussion we had on the amendments.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was very grateful for more concrete detail on a number of aspects, also for new insights on, for example, foreign currency loans or exchange-rate fluctuations. We were not able to accept amendments which went beyond the scope of the Directive, thereby suggesting a revision of it, or which properly belonged in other areas – for example mortgage loans or the supervision of financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am firmly convinced, however, that we need consistent parameters. If it is true that take-up of cross-border credit is less than 2 %, then I think it is a matter of urgency that we concentrate first on implementing the rules we already have, before we start thinking about new and different rules that go further still.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should take time to gather experience. Only in this way can the banks learn what they need to do, only in this way can consumers see what they can trust. I am sure we shall then have a chance of improving on that 2 %.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, although the Consumer Credit Directive currently in force has created a common European legal framework to protect consumers, some legal and practical obstacles have still to be overcome, which is demonstrated, in particular, by the lack of sufficient consumer information about opportunities for cross-border consumer credit and the rights of consumers when concluding such contracts.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, adequate consumer protection practices in the credit sector play a significant role in ensuring financial stability. Improving the cross-border consumer credit market would also significantly boost the internal market. Financial institutions must be required to provide consumers with personalised, complete, easily understandable information regarding the risks involved in lending. This information should ideally be included in advertising of consumer credit agreements, in pre-contractual information and in the actual consumer credit agreements.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A high standard of consumer protection in this area is absolutely key to improving financial integration, increasing demand and supporting growth.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, when people want to take out a loan, they encounter the fact that the costs of the loan are higher than expected, since some important information has not been communicated to them or has not been communicated clearly. Indeed, a common, negative experience is that consumer credit conditions are often difficult to understand. This year, as the rapporteur has mentioned, an investigation at Union level reviewed numerous websites advertising consumer credit, for example 16 in my country, Hungary. Of these, 11 were found not to comply with the Union consumer-protection rules, but there is a much worse situation than that. For example, 93 were reviewed in Belgium, and there was a problem with 89 of them. I think this result is absolutely desperate. In my view, banks not only have a problem with credit construction but also with credit brokers, since it often emerges from the credit-broking companies themselves that they actually represent a consumer group and are therefore capable of misleading consumers. We have a double task: on the one hand, to represent consumers and, on the other, to regulate companies that engage in such misleading practices.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, through its report on consumer credit, Parliament seeks a better level of consumer protection. We call for an obligation on financial institutions to provide consumers with personalised, complete and easily understandable explanations regarding the risks involved in foreign currency lending and the impact that interest rate increases on foreign currency loans have on the rates. These explanations must be provided before any contract is signed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the case of loans, we would stress the importance of the right to information about the cost of additional services, and consumers’ right to buy auxiliary services such as insurance from alternative suppliers. Prior to interest rate changes, notification to consumers should afford them enough time to survey the market and to change credit provider before the changes take effect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, consumer credit is a special problem. This area of the market is booming. In 2010, EU citizens owed consumer credit debts amounting to EUR 600 billion. Therefore caution is advisable here. With a consumer loan, it is not the lowest monthly payments or the lowest interest rate that are the deciding factor, but the overall cost of the loan. In order for the consumer to judge whether a loan from his local bank is not cheaper, it is imperative that he knows the real interest rate, fees and the cost of compulsory default insurance. However, with online loans especially, this basic information is often not provided. This must be regulated at European level, because online loans are offered across borders. Moreover, consumers must be able to compare the many and varied products offered by financial providers properly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too commend this report, which aims to harmonise consumer protection and to improve competition. I agree that the cross-border market for consumer credit needs to be strengthened. This will promote the functioning of the internal market. At the same time, consumers need to be better informed and to benefit from a higher level of protection. Full and precise information is necessary to help consumers understand the risks they may face. This will enable them to take better decisions in full knowledge of the facts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The supervisory authorities have a very important role here. They need to monitor and prevent the risks involved in making foreign currency loans. However, I believe that greater importance needs to be given to informing consumers about the cost of services.</p>

    <intervention id="1-191-000" speaker_id="96718" name="Olga Sehnalová" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the Consumer Credit Directive has increased the level of protection from some predatory loans – for example, by enabling consumers to cancel a contract within 14 days without giving a reason. Even so, the monitoring bodies are still finding various defects in controls on credit providers and intermediaries for non-bank consumer credit – for example, advertisements offering credit which often do not contain all the legally required data. In the Czech Republic, for instance, this applies to up to half the cases checked. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the report calls for stronger supervision of advertising practices in order to avoid the dissemination of misleading or false information.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I shall also mention another specific problem, which relates to what are known as SMS loans. A growing number of providers of these loans, which at first glance are quick and accessible, exploit the fact that the rules are vague. As a consequence, some consumers do not anticipate that the credit terms and conditions will be so disadvantageous, and they easily get into difficulties paying it off. Therefore, I support extension of the existing level of consumer protection to loans involving amounts below the lower threshold laid down in the current directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, misleading or unclear information regarding the total cost of loans to consumers can cause serious financial difficulties, particularly to households with limited available incomes. The Commission must ensure that the Consumer Credit Directive is correctly transposed by Member States and that consumers have a right to definite information relating to borrowing rates and charges incurred that is provided in an intelligible manner. Information provided online by financial institutions has been found wanting by Commission checks, whereas a significant majority of the websites monitored provided either insufficient or misleading information and a significant proportion of cross-border loans were taken out online. I have particular concerns about the specific risks involved. The exchange rate and interest rate variations, especially at times of financial volatility, can cause sudden and significant hikes in the cost of loans. Loans are increasingly taken out by other means, for example SMS loans. This is a cause for concern and I would urge the Commission to act on it.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think it is important to set this in context. This is a report on implementation of an existing directive. I think though that there has been considerable disappointment expressed by many colleagues here that the provisions of what is a very good directive are not actually being consistently implemented. That is really a crucial message.</p>
      <p sl="en">The broader message I would give to the Commission is that in this committee we are not content just to pass legislation, but we want to follow it through and make sure that it is properly implemented. So I think there is some clear cause for action here.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of countries have raised with us during our visits the question of SMS loans. But of course it is down to them to deal with that because actually they do not need to apply the de minimis threshold to implement this regulation. But I think maybe the Commission wishes to issue some guidelines on this basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would say that the Commission needs to take seriously our recommendation that this directive needs no further reforms. We actually want it to be properly implemented. We are not looking for a recast or fundamental changes to what we think is a good proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to express the Commission’s thanks to Mrs Collin-Langen for preparing, on behalf of Parliament, the resolution on the implementation of the Consumer Credit Directive in the European Union. This resolution is important because it represents the voice of European citizens on the important issue of borrowing, which is a sensitive area for individuals and for the European economy. While borrowing helps in everyday life, its use can also be a source of problems if not managed in an adequate manner. This is particularly relevant in the context of the current economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current EU legislation, the Consumer Credit Directive, adopted in 2008, intends not only to enhance the single market for consumer credit, but also to ensure a high level of consumer protection. The Commission recognises the main message of the draft resolution which points to the fact that the Consumer Credit Directive is not yet fully implemented in the Member States. We also welcome the opportunity for advertising and marketing practices to be strictly monitored and for consumers to obtain adequate explanation regarding the risk they take when entering into a credit agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the resolution there is certainly room for work by the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, to improve the implementation and enforcement of this important piece of legislation. The Commission is currently checking that the Consumer Credit Directive has been correctly transposed into national legislation by the Member States. In 2013 the Commission will organise dedicated meetings with the Member States in order to discuss concrete issues relating to the implementation and enforcement of the directive. In line with the requirements of the directive, the Commission is currently preparing a report on its implementation which is due to be published in June 2013. I can inform Members that, also for 2013, the Commission is planning a specific action in selected Member States aimed at further empowering consumers through awareness raising and education on the rights granted to them by the Consumer Credit Directive.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it gives me immense pleasure today to present this report on the Social Investment Pact – as a response to the crisis, which the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted almost unanimously at its meeting on 10 July this year. The report is part of the wide-ranging debate which has been going on for several years at European level concerning the strategy for overcoming the economic and social crisis. As a result of the crisis, which continues to be a real threat to the stability of many European Union countries, we have had to contend for a long time with huge problems on the European labour market, with unemployment at over 10 %, a high level of youth unemployment and a chronic shortage of jobs for people with low qualifications. The situation is aggravated by demographic problems, an education and training system unsuited to the needs of the labour market and growing pressure on the social security system. All the measures aimed at restoring the stability of public finances in the European Union and the associated budgetary spending cuts were, and continue to be, necessary in order to ensure the stability of the European economy. Without them, the effects of the crisis would undoubtedly be even more painful. However, those measures need to be accompanied by well-directed social investments, aimed at preparing citizens for the changing economic conditions and needs of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The crisis demands that Member States rethink their social policies and effectively transform the welfare state into an activating state that invests in people and gives its citizens hope and incentive, rather than simply reacting to damage caused by the imperfections of the market. Member States’ budgetary policies must therefore be supplemented, among other things, by measures aimed at achieving a lasting improvement on the labour market, promoting investment in education and training, and combating poverty and social exclusion. Social investments cover many different policy areas and are therefore essential for ensuring a proper level of employment and greater European competitiveness. Since their purpose is to reconcile social and economic aims, governments must treat them not as expenditure but, above all, as investments that will yield real profit in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Experience shows that previous attempts at a coordinated European Union approach to social investments, such as the Lisbon Strategy and the European Employment Strategy, failed because of poor management. It is accordingly essential to ensure better monitoring of the implementation of social and employment policies in the Member States. In the report, we therefore propose that the Member States accede to the Social Investment Pact, which will enable us to establish better machinery for managing and monitoring implementation of the employment, social policy and education objectives laid down, inter alia, in the Europe 2020 strategy. The monitoring of those policies must also figure in the European Semester 2013. In addition, if these measures are to become a reality, the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 will have to include adequate budget funding for social investments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In presenting a report entitled the ‘Social Investment Pact – as a response to the crisis’, I wish to stress very clearly that every recommendation it contains is the outcome of far-reaching agreement among all the political groups. Let me take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs most warmly for their constructive and effective work on the provisions of the report, as well as all colleagues who have tabled amendments. I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Frank Broeker, in particular, whose scholarly work inspired me to draw up a report on the subject of social investments. I call on the representative of the European Commission to act on the recommendations contained in the report and propose instruments that will enable a set of good ideas to be put into practice, and thus make it possible for our European society to cope with the present difficult situation. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe we are witnessing a constant worsening of the unemployment figures for the under-35s, which now approach 25 %, and in some Member States are more than 50 %. It must certainly not be the young who pay for this crisis. However, while it is true that we cannot wriggle out of the measures for austerity and rebalancing the budgets, it is also true that, in parallel with this, we need a concrete and ambitious investment strategy, starting with investment in education and Community programmes such as Erasmus.</p>

Another pressing issue is the situation of low-skilled workers, who face constantly decreasing labour demand, and the increasing number of people living in poverty and at risk of social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Recent responses to the crisis lack a social and employment policy dimension. The aim of social investments is to prepare individuals, families and societies to adapt to changing economic conditions and labour market demands. Economic governance and macroeconomic supervision should be complemented by measures on social and employment policy.</p>

My main concern is the situation of young people, because they are the ones most affected by the economic crisis, and youth unemployment has reached an alarming level. Against this background, vocational training programmes are vital, and the re-establishment of vocational schools has an important place in this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Jobs should be created by exploiting our own mineral resources too, not just via foreign investment. Facilities should also be provided to encourage employers to take on young people, by decreasing employers’ contributions. However, measures are needed at EU level too.

For example, it does not go into any depth in considering which resources the Member States should use to deal with the crisis, nor does it criticise the scandalous choice made by the European Commission in financing the banks without using the funds awarded to bring about economic upturn, thus allowing the credit institutions not to help businesses and families but to acquire government securities, ensuring a guaranteed profit for themselves at almost no risk.</p>
      <p sl="it">Accordingly, the decision was taken, in a period of crisis like this, to finance the banks rather than to encourage an improvement in the economic structure. It would have been an excellent proposal to call on the Commission to propose removing the prohibition on direct aid to the States by the European Central Bank. I shall abstain, since the report amounts to a simple declaration of intent, on points that we all support, but which is devoid of content or concrete proposals.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the economic crisis and its negative effects, with which the economies of all countries are having to contend, force us to take up continuous new challenges. In the face of growing unemployment, especially youth unemployment, as well as the increasing threat of poverty and social exclusion, it is of great importance to support social investment in the widest sense, which, among other things, promotes adaptation to changes on the labour market and the acquisition of new skills.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On many occasions in this Chamber, we have discussed the need to establish mechanisms to promote labour mobility and the development of practical education and vocational training, or to counter the unequal treatment of employees on grounds of gender. All these aspects of previous discussions lose none of their importance when it comes to the Social Investment Pact. They are, moreover, an integral part of it. For that reason, I call on the Commission, in conjunction with the governments of the Member States, to establish machinery for the development of social investments, which constitute an element of great importance in combating the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, may I first of all congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Danuta Jazłowiecka, on an excellent report and for taking up the important subject of social investments. This report comes at a crucial moment when the European Union budget, both next year’s budget and the financial framework for 2014-2020, is a burning issue. The Union’s budget should be an investment budget that promotes a way out of economic difficulties and concentrates on areas of strategic importance for growth and employment. Social investments combining the social and economic dimensions are a good way to implement effective, long-term activities that promote adaptation to changes on the labour market and increase opportunities for youth employment by creating conditions for corporate growth and development of the social economy. For that reason, I also consider that ensuring a suitable level of financial support for social investments is a condition for the European Union economy to return to the path of growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Jazłowiecka, for this timely report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crisis and long-term structural challenges such as demographic ageing do indeed require sustained but effective and efficient investment in our human capital. Deepening inequalities and increasing poverty and exclusion hamper growth and threaten both our social cohesion and the sustainability of our public finances. That is why the Commission included a social investment package for growth and cohesion in its 2013 annual work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The package is the Commission’s response to the challenges arising from the rapid demographic changes exacerbated by the current crisis. This translates, in particular, into difficulty in meeting the Europe 2020 strategy target of reducing by 20 million the number of people living in poverty or social exclusion by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission agrees on the need, highlighted in the Social Investment Pact, for public policies that prepare people to adapt to societal and economic challenges. For this to happen, sustained investment in our human capital to raise our competitiveness must go hand in hand with social inclusion and proper social protection. By investing in social policies that empower people from an early age, strengthen their capability to cope with risks and enhance their opportunities to participate in society and the labour market, we can anticipate and prepare rather than simply repair.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares the view that better alignment of guidance, assessment and support for Member States’ reforms is needed, which acknowledges the interconditionalities of our social and economic policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission welcomes the balanced approach of the Social Investment Pact concerning the need to tackle both short- and medium- to longer-term challenges. These challenges call for a broad range of actions, including the identification and elimination of inefficiencies in social protection systems and the strengthening of their activating and investment orientation. The Commission will take Parliament’s resolution duly into account when preparing the social investment package and is looking forward to further dialogue to enrich its thinking and nourish the future development of social policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Over the past few years, most of the responses to the economic and financial crisis have been focused on the objective of restoring sustainability in public finances, something which is fundamental to the economy of the Union. In my view, however, it is appropriate now to pay attention to the negative effects that such austerity measures can have on employment and competitiveness in Europe and to supplement them with interventions that aim to promote jobs, such as well targeted social investments. The situation in the jobs market in Europe, already a complex one, has been further exacerbated by problems relating to educational systems and the ageing population. On the one hand, the output from education in the Union is not suited to the growing need for specialised work demanded by the market, and on the other – because of the ageing population – the number of people joining the jobs market is falling. This demographic trend will have serious repercussions for the jobs market, for the potential for economic growth and for public savings. I believe that, in order to restore sustainable growth in Europe, it is imperative to meet these challenges, partly through well targeted social investments which have the objective of preparing society to manage a change to much more flexible jobs markets, of restoring sufficient levels of employment in future and of improving Europe’s competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="de">When we vote tomorrow on the own-initiative report on a Social Investment Pact, it will become apparent whether we finally have a cross-party understanding of how we need to tackle the crisis. Our collective response must be not simply cost-cutting measures, but specific measures to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We can achieve these targets, but it will not happen by itself. If we want more jobs, we must make it possible for our economy to employ more people. Between 2008 and 2011, there was a 4 % fall in output in Europe (from 20 % to 16 %) which resulted in an 11 % fall in employment. On the one hand, that means that we have to invest in places where new jobs are needed. On the other hand, it also means that we have to pay special attention to the nature of these jobs: jobs must be sustainable and must offer decent employment conditions. The crisis must not be an excuse for low wages and social dumping! Europe’s economic policy must be expanded to include a compensatory social policy. We in particular, as the European Parliament, must resolutely uphold the interests of the individual in Europe. Accordingly, I would urge honourable Members to press energetically for European workers to be given back their right to decent employment!</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0305/2012) by Heinz K. Becker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on Social Business Initiative – Creating a favourable climate for social enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy and innovation 2012/2004(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-214-000" speaker_id="107041" name="Heinz K. Becker" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. With the Social Business Initiative, Europe is demonstrating its commitment to social action very proactively, on the one hand to accommodate demographic change and, on the other hand, to answer the challenges of the labour market and the growing need for social benefits and services, in both the ‘white’ economy (health and social care) and the ‘green’ economy. That means in the context of a broader understanding of ‘social’ which encompasses not only the traditional areas of health, support services, education and care but also the environment. The European initiative on positive action to develop social enterprises was backed by the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs through extremely constructive cooperation. My sincere thanks go to the shadow rapporteur, the committee secretariat and the Commission, also to my parliamentary assistant.</p>
      <p sl="de">The great interest in this initiative that exists in the European Parliament is also borne out by the 280 and more amendments and 30 or so compromise amendments, which ultimately secured overwhelming approval of the report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are the key points in the report: we will encourage a future rise in demand for innovative products and services by creating a new and innovative social business climate – specifically on behalf of young people who will find new, attractive and promising career opportunities here. There is great potential here – and what could be more important at the present time?</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to strengthen and encourage all social enterprises that have hitherto been successful, namely associations, cooperatives, mutuals, social foundations and – for the first time – all those who, on the basis of personal and private initiatives, as sole traders or team players in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises, will avail themselves of the growing number of market opportunities to meet the need for social services and achieve social objectives with true innovative commitment. Yes, our report states that the social economy is part of the eco-social market economy as well as of the European single market, so it stands on an equal footing with all other corporate forms. There is one paramount criterion for social businesses: they must produce a demonstrable social effect within society – whether it is childcare for working mothers, care for dementia patients, advice on switching to green technologies or a restaurant that provides work for young unemployed people. The Global Social Business Summit held in Vienna 10 days ago was based on thousands of different examples.</p>
      <p sl="de">The definitions of social business are drawn from the EU’s Programme for Social Change and Innovation and are compatible with other reports. Social Business has proved itself crisis-resistant. We want better access to funding, including the new Social Investment Fund, which together with a labelling system, a quality mark, will attract new investors and cooperation partners. However, we also want better access to public procurement. We believe there must be eligibility for funding under all the EU’s programmes. We want practicable parameters for social business Europe-wide, and I hope that this communication means we shall have massive support from the Commission. I am hoping for majority support in tomorrow’s plenary. Social business has enormous potential as a new and powerful instrument for helping to solve social problems, thereby ensuring that Europe remains the world benchmark for social action.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, social enterprises providing services of general interest represent 10 % of all European businesses and employ at least 11 million people in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, support of social enterprises through financial resources at local, regional and national level must reflect the economic viability of the business concerned, because it is undesirable for a business to depend exclusively on subsidies for survival and, after provision of these subsidies comes to an end, to be threatened with complete closure. If, in fact, a business is not capable of survival, an evaluation is really needed of whether it should ever actually have been set up on the social enterprise basis. In this connection, we should consider introducing financial support that will be preceded by an analysis of efficiency and of social return on investment, in order to develop the investment market and make it more transparent. However, many businesses face a lack of clear information about the possibilities of such financing and it can be complicated to obtain this information.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I should put it briefly: we ought to have clearer, simpler rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Becker very much for all his work on this report and his cooperation with all the shadows throughout. Social businesses can contribute enormously towards employment, particularly for the disabled and disadvantaged, but I think it is very important that we recognise that social businesses are real businesses and should make profits and reinvest them. I am as keen to reduce administrative burdens for social enterprises as I am for any other kind of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UK I have seen at first hand the wonderful work done by Royal British Legion Industries. A social enterprise employing disabled people, they compete in the open market and they succeed. They belong to a European-wide organisation called Homabilis, sharing good practice and cooperating right across the EU. They deserve our support.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, social business has a high resilience to crises and solid business models, as well as meeting all the objectives of the 2020 strategy. Support for social businesses brings economic advantages, but it is primarily in the very nature of their activities and their modus operandi to help to build a more cohesive, democratic and active society that contributes to job creation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Accordingly, initiatives to improve the legal and fiscal environment and a European social label – the principle of the most economically advantageous tenders rather than the lowest cost in public procurement contracts – will help to create financial independence and a highly innovative eco-social market economy. For this reason, I compliment Mr Becker on his excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, social enterprises employ at least 11 million people in the EU, accounting for 6 % of the entire EU workforce and 10 % of all European businesses. EU Structural Funds and programmes play a significant role in facilitating access to financing for social enterprises. For this reason, access to EU funding needs to be simplified, while allowing for adequate flexibility at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would stress the importance of a strategy and of measures promoting social entrepreneurship and innovative social enterprises, especially with regard to young and disadvantaged people. We call for the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme to be continued and for its attractiveness and visibility in the social economy to be improved.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague for his work on this report. We are currently facing a growth in demand for social services, primarily as a result of demographic changes. Social enterprises have difficulty in finding the funding they need, according to their level of development. Therefore, those providing Services of General Interest need incentives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that access to private finance should be ensured first and foremost, but EU funds should also be used to support social enterprises. Similarly, Member States could adapt the legal framework, improving access to public procurement contracts. Not least, the visibility and management ability of social entrepreneurs need to be improved. This could be done partly through programmes like Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs.</p>

    <intervention id="1-221-000" speaker_id="95017" name="Iosif Matula" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, social entrepreneurs are known for their ambition and persistence, using their energies to identify solutions to the problems faced by society. They are visionaries, but also realists, whose work changes as the social system adapts to the needs of the community. Global financial institutions recognise the benefits of investing in development, by supporting social entrepreneurs, and they usually prefer to fund them rather than social aid programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am convinced that social enterprises provide the necessary link between the private sector, driven by maximising profit, and the public sector, which needs to respond to social needs. Combining these two approaches makes payments more efficient and reduces losses, with direct benefits for the citizen. Social enterprises should benefit from the support of European funds of the prudential investors’ type, and be able to access a range of financial instruments. They also need the support of the national, regional and local authorities, both where financing is concerned and also in promoting them to give legitimacy to their social entrepreneurship initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commission, and you especially, Mr Barnier, show great initiative, great engagement, when it comes to social business. That is good, and very welcome. I have one major criticism of this Commission proposal, however: the basic idea of opening up social business to financial market operations is not a good one.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission bases itself on the premise of commercial, profit-making enterprises. For a field where lenders or businesses have an overwhelmingly social remit and reinvest their profits, the European fund is not the right instrument. Private investors investing long term in not-for-profit projects already have a range of options: development banks or public-private partnerships, to name just two. Social business must continue to be organised democratically on a basis of solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, although they represent approximately two million businesses and 11 million employees, social enterprises in the EU have to make do with an underdeveloped funding system. I therefore feel it is absolutely essential to promote additional means of funding, both nationally and at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One solution would be to simplify access to the relevant structural funds under the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, and another could be to include special arrangements under the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the Horizon 2020 Fund and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, for the use of microfinance and social entrepreneurship. This is the only way we can guarantee adequate support for social enterprises, which promote high-quality jobs, combat poverty and social exclusion, and invest in education and vocational training for citizens of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we know that the social dimension of the economic and financial crisis will make its presence felt more than ever in the period to come. More and more of us think that, while dealing with the European crisis, bringing down sovereign debt and reaching budget-deficit goals, we have paid too little attention to the social consequences of the crisis. In recent years, economic matters have ruled out all other aspects, and citizens rightly feel that nobody has come up with an answer to growing unemployment, the problems of education systems or the phenomenon of poverty. The governments of the Member States know very well what the consequences will be if they ignore certain social demands. Now is the time for social matters to be given particular attention at the level of European policy. This, however, will require joint efforts on the part of the Council, the Commission and Parliament. We cannot allow European countries to sacrifice their developed social systems on the altar of crisis management.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Good evening, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to Mr Becker and each of the speakers in this debate on what I believe to be a major topic, one on which we have been working for several months with my colleagues Mr Tajani and Mr Andor, in order to draw up a roadmap for social entrepreneurship. We know that it accounts for several percentage points of European GDP, through businesses in all their various forms across the 27 countries of the European Union, and several millions of jobs, and has a genuine capacity for innovation, commitment and investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Becker, the report you are presenting is extremely important because it consolidates the approach we have been developing on many lines and initiatives. We shall continue with the same determination, the same tenacity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First on finance, as you know, in October 2011, we proposed that social enterprises, the social economy, should be an investment priority in the next generation of structural funds for the period 2014-2020. This, of course, is a Commission proposal that will have to be approved by Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also happy to say that the inclusion of social enterprises in our draft programme for social change and innovation received widespread support. It was adopted on 6 October last.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In December, we also modernised the package on state aids to Services of General Interest by adopting measures favourable to social enterprises when they supply a social service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On private financing, Ms Regner; Mr Becker, you have supported the draft regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds proposed by the Commission on 7 December last. Ms Regner, these are private funds, and although I proposed this new instrument, it was not in order to use public funds but so that when, and it does happen, private investors, people who have private funds, wish to invest in a field or in businesses, for example start-ups with a social aim, there is a means of collating the private funds and directing them towards a social economy goal. There is, therefore, no contradiction with all sorts of other initiatives that sometimes use public funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope we will be able to reach an agreement on the social enterprise fund; we are really on the correct road, and I hope we will be able to find a solution, including on tax havens; a solution, if everyone in the Council and Parliament is willing to compromise, then maybe that will be possible, provided that the compromise is a dynamic one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the legal framework, beyond the financial issues, I am aware that Parliament is attached to the idea of a European statute for associations. I am as well, and I strike a note of caution here by noting that, in 1991, a previous Commission proposal was blocked in Council and was therefore withdrawn.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, since 8 February 2012, we have made progress on another matter close to my heart, namely the status of the European Foundation; this is an initial step forward on this matter, and I hope that further progress can be made. In any event, I have recently met all major stakeholders in European foundations in all their diversity who support our initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to make reference to the work done on modernising the ‘Public Procurement’ directives. This is another instance of a regulatory framework that can help social entrepreneurship to expand rapidly if the rules you adopt, as I hope you will, make it easier to define public procurement in terms of social integration, innovation and environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, work on our proposals is now well under way, and I hope that, in the coming weeks, we will be able to reach agreement on the new, simpler, better-defined framework for public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, these initiatives are not everything; there is still much for us to do. That is why my colleagues, Mr Tajani, Mr Andor and I wanted the Single Market Act II, the 12 new key proposals that we shall put on the table, to include a control switch to protect consumers and encourage innovation and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the framework of the Single Market Act II, we shall work on innovative instruments to measure the impact of social enterprises. In parallel, we shall conduct a screening exercise and take a snapshot of what social enterprises, in all their diversity, mean in the 27 countries of the European Union. As regards the impact of social enterprises, we will therefore have the means of enhancing their reliability for investors; this is another project noted in Mr Becker’s report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Beyond the regulatory framework, we must do everything we can in terms of financial facilitation, to enhance visibility, knowledge, the pooling of good practice among social enterprises in Europe, as you have requested, studies, registrations on University Erasmus programmes, training, better usage of European programmes. We are not working alone on this matter, and in Brussels and Strasbourg we also need to establish a wide-ranging platform for debate. We have already made a start with a major conference in which some of you participated in November 2011. We established a group of experts with whom Mr Becker was able to hold discussions last June. This is the first time that the Commission has been accompanied in its own debates and in the drafting of certain texts by a group of experts on social entrepreneurship. My colleagues and I intend to host a further major meeting on social entrepreneurship at the beginning of 2014 to draw up a balance sheet of everything done during the five years leading up to that date and to launch new initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would be pleased if all of you who wish to do so could participate in this major meeting on social entrepreneurship and the social economy at the beginning of 2014.</p>

      <p sl="en">Good evening Mr Tajani and all the people who are helping you.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, we have here a difficult technical and lengthy subject to address, which is very important for the internal market. It concerns not only technical standards for two-wheeled vehicles but certainly also surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To start with the first topic, technical standards: in the past two years we have had detailed discussions on five points, and those are, at the same time, the subjects of this Regulation. Firstly, the classification of the vehicles is to be made clearer. I have discussed ATVs at length with Mr Panzeri, and we have found a neat solution. We had a very in-depth discussion of the ABS and CBS braking systems on powered two-wheelers, and the braking systems must make for greater safety. For small scooters, we have agreed that there will be further research as to whether that is actually effective. We have also looked at the emission standards for scooters, since they are fairly polluting, especially in urban areas. We have looked at durability mileages: is a scooter still just as clean after five years as after the first year? We also looked at the vehicle lighting.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, Mr President, it is also very important if we are to keep cheap goods from China, India and Korea that are unsafe out of the EU. That is not protectionism, it is simply protecting quality for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Before I continue, I should like once again to thank all those who took part in the consultation, especially the Danish Presidency which made an important contribution, but also, of course, the Council and the Commission, for what we have all achieved.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another couple of questions for the Commissioner. Firstly, the negotiations on delegated and implementing acts. We have agreed that the industry is being allowed enough time to introduce this new Regulation, but if the consultation on delegated and implementing acts takes too long, there is no lead time left. Therefore I would like an assurance from the Commissioner that the Commission is making progress with the implementing and delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A second point, Mr President, concerns emission standards and, in particular, Euro 5 in 2016. The Commission is to investigate this, and the aim is that we look not just at pollution but also at costs and also, here again, at lead time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the past few days, the position with electrical bicycles has become somewhat unclear. Electrical bicycles do not come under this Directive. They are covered only by the Machinery Directive, 250 watts and maximum speed 25 km. I would like to keep it at that, because more powerful electrical bicycles just lead to serious accidents. If electrical bicycle manufacturers want something different, they can still be in this Directive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Mr President, the contact with English motorcyclists. English motorcyclists have been following what we do with a very critical eye, and rightly so. It is good for democracy for English motorcyclists to keep a critical eye on us. Modification is fine, tuning up is not. English motorcyclists also have to be able to understand that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative procedure began in November 2010 and has been a demanding task from a technical and political point of view, lasting a good two years and involving three Presidencies. It is therefore appropriate to thank all those who have been involved: the shadow rapporteurs, Parliament’s Secretariat and the political group secretariats and MEPs’ assistants – and, of course, the Commission and the Council. Agreement was reached at first reading, a fact that I consider highly significant.</p>
      <p sl="it">The objective of this regulation is to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, in particular, the application of a large number of important criteria to improve operational, road and occupational safety for users, that is to say workers, and standards of environmental protection. In this context, the introduction in Articles 7 and 8 of new operational and occupational requirements may be considered a real success for the whole of the European Parliament, which has succeeded in covering risks which, at present, affect numerous operators, often with fatal consequences: one need only think of protection from electrical discharge or indeed from overturning.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we must not underestimate the importance of worker health and safety, and so we have made provisions for the market surveillance of vehicles, systems and components, in order to ensure that all the provisions are implemented properly and carried out effectively. To sum up, the regulation helps to make industry more competitive, since it simplifies current legislation on the approval of vehicles, making it more transparent and reducing red tape. In fact, 24 base directives and around 25 related amending directives on technical requirements are being repealed and replaced by a single regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">These aspects are important, because this regulation seeks to achieve other objectives, beyond helping to create a regulated internal market and to provide a framework enabling a competitive, balanced and transparent system. In addition, I believe we are also contributing to strengthening the sector, and in short we are putting in place the conditions for both widening the productive base and increasing employment. The work that has been done is therefore highly important and extremely useful: the compromises found between the political groups are the result of a major collaborative effort undertaken in the right spirit, with the desire to present Parliament with a consensus regulation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, I am delighted to be here, particularly now at the conclusion of the procedure – a procedure which has been long and, in some cases, difficult – to approve two important technical legislative texts which will also help to reduce the amount of legislation in force. I am also delighted because, as regards the approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles, I made this commitment during the parliamentary hearing when I was Commissioner-designate for Industry, and I am pleased that I have upheld this commitment and that Parliament has been able to approve the provisions thereof.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mr Panzeri has already emphasised, the long negotiations have had positive results. I would like to thank both the rapporteurs, and indeed the shadow rapporteurs: the compromise texts are the result of a series of constructive discussions, including discussions with the Commission and the Council, which have taken almost two years because, as I was saying, this is a highly complex subject – from a technical point of view as well. I must emphasise that the new regulations will make a substantial improvement to the environmental and safety performance in all the vehicles we are discussing, which will be advantageous for citizens and the whole of society, and they also allow industry sufficient time to adapt production to the new requirements. Moreover, the simplifying amendments in the two legislative texts will allow costs to public authorities and business to be reduced; so we have succeeded in achieving a number of positive results.</p>
      <p sl="it">The adoption of these two legislative acts represents an important step forward in the area of simplification under the Better Legislation project and in consolidating the internal market, as the two rapporteurs have reminded us. The two proposed regulations in fact repeal and replace around 40 directives, each of which corresponds to various instances of transposition and implementation, on which I have taken note of the request made by Mr van de Camp, so we shall also make sure we follow up in detail the aspect the rapporteur has brought out. The work has also served to make the two systems of approval more cohesive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, I would like to outline some of the main elements in the two texts. First, provisions have been introduced on the access to repair and maintenance information, to ensure conditions of fair competition, to the advantage of those operating in the sector and consumers. Secondly, requirements for market surveillance have been introduced. Thirdly, a cohesive system has been introduced for classification of the different categories of vehicle: a particular case concerns vehicles intended for specific tasks, such as off-road vehicles and utility task vehicles, which can be included in the classifications of both regulations again if they meet the relevant definitions and technical requirements. Fourthly, environmental protection and the safety of the vehicles in question have been improved: I will not go into the individual proposals in detail, since the rapporteurs have already done that with great clarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are just a few in a long list of topics discussed and agreed by Parliament and the Council with, I would say, highly satisfactory results. For this reason, I would like to thank Parliament once again, not least for allowing me to maintain the commitment I undertook before you and before the citizens – which, in my view, has positive benefits for the Community institutions at a time when there is often mistrust towards us. Working well and keeping the promises we have made also means responding concretely to the messages coming through to us from many parts of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur Wim van de Camp on the agreement reached by the Council and by Parliament. In the Committee on Transport we looked at this proposal mainly from a road safety aspect because moped and motorcycle accidents represent around 16 % of the total number of road deaths in the EU. I therefore welcome the fact that the agreed text will tackle in the most optimal way the road safety performances of motor bikes, mopeds, scooters and quads and will lay down the most appropriate and effective safety measures and technical requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the inclusion of off-road quads under this regulation because this was one of the Transport Committee’s proposals. Indeed these quads, which are often designed for use off-road, are driven on public roads and should therefore fulfil the minimal functional safety requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards anti-lock braking systems and combined braking systems for motorbikes, the Transport Committee considered that achieving the maximum achievable level of safety was a top priority. If future impact assessment demonstrates that anti-lock braking systems can assure the best braking performances for all performance motorbikes, then this should be addressed in this regulation if the case has been proven.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I support the solution which has been found for the inclusion of Enduro trial motorcycles within the scope of this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr van de Camp on his report. I feel that this long-awaited motion rightly draws attention to this sector and to the question of what requirements should be met in the manufacture of such vehicles. When regulating, however, we must pay attention to the fact that the two-wheel motor-vehicle sector plays a particularly important role in the EU from the perspective of the economy and jobs. About 100 medium-sized manufacturers account for 90 % of European production, and the remaining 10 % is divided up among numerous small manufacturers. All of them operate in different Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I think the deficiencies in the background to the minor problems experienced up to now were primarily of a regulatory nature, or a result of the fact that there have been directives, regulations, standards and provisions like the environmental-protection standards, for example, that were created in 2006. For all these reasons, further progress by the European Commission is recommended for the gradual introduction of new European grades over the next decade.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This report also contains vehicle-safety provisions, since improvements in the safety of motorcycles on public roads is high on the list of strategic objectives for the European Union between 2011 and 2020. It is therefore also important that the end result gives all of us a significant amount of added value in order for us to deal with this matter properly.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Improvements to the operation of the internal market are necessary, on the one hand to enable unrestricted access to vehicle repair information through achieving regulation of technical information, and on the other so that there is real competition in the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services.</p>
      <p sl="hu">With regard to the manufacturers’ websites, it is therefore appropriate to define technical provisions and targeted measures to ensure acceptable access for small and medium-sized enterprises too. This is particularly important in the present situation. In addition to its numerous positive points, the report revises the market-surveillance procedures under the relevant regulation, in comparison with the former monitoring system, and thus aims at the development of a much more effective monitoring system. It is also important that it distinguishes between type-approved and non-type-approved products, so all components and independent technical units that are built into the vehicle will be subject to monitoring from now on.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the whole, therefore, we can say that we must exploit the synergies arising from the review of legislation on the type-approval of motorcycles. The rapporteur has done some excellent work. I would like to congratulate him once more; in the future, we will not need to do anything other than transpose regulations of the highest quality and make sure that they are brought to fruition as quickly as possible in order to achieve the goals defined in the report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe’s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour.</p>
      <p sl="de">I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS.</p>
      <p sl="de">Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission’s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I also want to thank Mr van de Camp and Mr Panzeri for their cooperation. These are two important Regulations for improving the internal market. They increase safety, improve the environment, provide more clarity for manufacturers and consumers and reduce costs and especially administrative burdens and, above all, rules. As a liberal, I am very much in favour of that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It was a particularly technical subject, very technical. I often thought of myself as a technocrat. It was so difficult and the number of amendments was so huge that I felt more like an engineer than a politician.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would have liked this report to have a rather more political dimension. For instance, do we want to have interchangeable batteries in future when vehicles are electric? Do we want to encourage innovation or do we fix everything now in the type approval? Do we want more visibility, for instance on the side, to ensure safety? How can we prevent counterfeits or poor quality products? Mr van de Camp has also mentioned that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For instance, will our vehicles have ‘made in Europe’ on them, or do we not indicate where they are made? How can we prevent unfair competition? For instance, I often hear complaints about tractors and trailers being used, whilst on the other hand lorries are used that have to conform to much more complicated type approval.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last but not least, Mr President, the driver often determines how safe his vehicle is. I would have liked us to establish minimum European rules for drivers and requirements for regular further training or information, because you get your driving licence at one time, but the technical changes to vehicles also change that and drivers are often not prepared for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All in all, Mr President, it is a good result. I am satisfied with it and I will recommend that my group vote in favour of it. In future, however, I would like us to make issues like this a little more political so that even citizens outside this building are a bit more interested in our work. Then we can expect political fireworks. I hope that it will succeed. I am most grateful to you, and I hope that tomorrow a huge majority will vote in favour on these two reports.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as well as the chairman of the committee, I also had the privilege of shadowing both these dossiers and chairing the conciliation committees. I want to particularly thank both the rapporteurs for their persistence in dealing with very substantial technical issues. I note that Mr Manders wants to make them politically more exciting, but these are actually really important dossiers for both industries which are going to set the pattern for a simplified and effective type-approval system from now on.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of motorcycles, I think it is particularly important that we have brought the environmental and safety performance of motorcycles forward significantly. Also let us remember that other light three- and four-wheel vehicles were included in this category. These vehicles are going to become more popular in urban environments and contribute to lower-carbon transport, and it was absolutely right to give them this framework. I want to thank Wim van de Camp in particular, because he also ensured that the phasing-in of those changes is handled in a sensible way and that we have effective and cost-efficient test methods.</p>
      <p sl="en">On agricultural tractors, again we had similar issues to contend with, but of course this also included road-going agricultural machinery, requiring a very complex series of rules and regulations. But we now have a genuine European type-approval system which will enable manufacturers – and there are many smaller manufacturers in this area – to present products for approval, and they can be sold anywhere in the European Union. I particularly welcome the fact that we are anticipating the development of higher-speed tractors now that we have more agricultural contracting, so those are included. We also resolved the issue of having two categories of light four-wheel quad bike vehicles, one for agriculture and one for leisure use.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall I think it is a remarkable example of collaboration between the two rapporteurs. I think my committee has handled this in an exemplary way, and I will just conclude by saying to the Commissioner that, of course, we are not finished yet. The scrutiny of aspects of the delegated acts – this is the first major package – is something that we will give great attention to, because we want to make absolutely sure that what is in these proposals is carried out satisfactorily and according to the needs of all the stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is significant concern regarding the justification of Article 18, which fails to provide any evidential basis for anti-tampering or for powertrains on functional safety and environmental grounds. Annex XVIII of the 2010 IMCO impact assessment clearly demonstrates this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision reached through trialogue to exempt bikes over 48 horsepower ties in with forthcoming driving licence directives, yet the regulation does not clarify this. If it is not about licence requirements and is based solely upon safety and environmental objectives, why are bikes over 48 horsepower exempt? The argument is somewhat circular.</p>
      <p sl="en">No impact assessment on the aftermarket part sales has been completed. If only fully type-approved parts may be sold in future, it could disproportionately affect smaller aftermarket producers who are unable to justify the cost of getting their products permitted.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the draft text has been on the IMCO website since 10 September 2012, it has existed in a shamefully incomplete form and the final document has not been accessible via the procedural file until this morning. What is being presented before Parliament today has not been in the public domain, nor in the necessary required languages, for long enough to enable due consideration. The overall process is of dubious democratic legality. There is a distinct lack of transparency surrounding legislation being pushed through having been rubber-stamped without proportionate scrutiny from Parliament ahead of the vote tomorrow. Reasons of budgetary restrictions have been given by the Commission for their manner of working. However, in light of this, I would ask at the very least that the vote be postponed until the correct democratic procedure has been followed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, trying to regulate everything at the same time makes regulations incomprehensible and ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do we really think that quads, electric bikes, mini motorbikes, side-cars and motocross bikes really belong in the same category of vehicles? Obviously not! Particularly as some of these vehicle are increasingly used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. It is therefore very appropriate to establish some sub-categories. Let us take a category of motor vehicles by way of illustration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In just a few years, quad-bikes, mini-motorbikes and mini-quad bikes have become a real plague of modern times because a minority of their drivers use them away from allocated areas in unsafe situations. They have become a danger to pedestrians, cyclists and animals and have caused considerable damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They are often low-cost products that do not, as a general rule, meet the safety requirements for use on the public highway. In France, 61 % of victims of accidents caused by quad bikes, mini-motorbikes or mini-quads are children under 10 years of age. These vehicles are, by their very nature, prone to accidents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we believe that it is crucial to give priority to passing legislation that further reinforces the law on safety, driver-training, noise emissions and driving conditions, the aim being, we all understand, to protect victims and law-abiding drivers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Wim van de Camp and Antonio Panzeri, for their reports. I want to take the opportunity in the presence of the Commissioner to raise concerns about some aspects of the safety requirements that the Commission is proposing through its roadworthiness package which was introduced in July 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Previously only four-wheel vehicles had been subject to mandatory annual testing; now all two- and three-wheelers including motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, will come under the umbrella for periodic roadworthiness tests through the Commission’s proposal. I have not seen a convincing case for the introduction of these tests for motorcycles.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was pointed out in a study co-funded by the European Commission that only about 1 % of accidents involving motorcycles are caused or linked to technical defects. Clearly road safety is the key concern in this debate, yet it is important that when carrying out assessments of safety requirements we compare past country experiences in a thorough manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we take the Netherlands, for example, there they have one of the lowest annual rates of motorcycle accidents, as I understand it, yet they have no compulsory roadworthiness tests for motorcycles. Additionally, Sweden is the only country in Scandinavia where periodic roadworthiness tests are mandatory for motorcycles. There was previously an annual test requirement for motorcycles older than 10 years, but this was changed in 2004 to biennial tests. One of the reasons was because roadworthiness tests did not require this sort of frequency. So far as I am informed, this decision has had no negative effective on Swedish motorcycle accident statistics.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been estimated that for users of motorcycles in Europe the proposal could inflict annual costs of up to EUR 1.2 billion. The costs of these measures may far outweigh the expected benefits. Will mandatory testing for all motorcycles make a real impact on accidents statistics in Europe? Let us see the evidence. We need to take a balanced approach on this especially in these difficult times where extra costs can be overwhelming for families and citizens. It is important that we lay down harmonised rules on the administrative and technical requirements for certain vehicles. These reports before us here tonight make vital steps to simplify legislation and to ensure that we are on the right path to making vehicles safer through internal harmonisation. However, it is important to harmonise policies across the EU, but only where they have a real impact.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, to aid the development and functioning of the EU internal market, Member States’ approval systems should be replaced with a harmonised European type-approval system. To simplify the legal framework and to ensure a high level of functional safety, safety at work and protection for the environment, the technical requirements and environmental standards that apply to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units, need to be harmonised, in the type-approval both of forestry and agricultural vehicles, and of vehicles with two or three wheels and quadricycles.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Similarly, the Regulation on two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles will improve road safety, with new technologies better taken into account, and improve market surveillance. We would stress that the Regulation on type-approval for forestry and agricultural vehicles must not affect national or EU measures on the use of these vehicles on public roads, such as specific requirements in respect of driving licences, maximum speed limits or measures to control access to certain roads.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To improve the functioning of the internal market, especially in respect of the free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, unlimited access is needed to vehicle repair information, through the use of a standardised format, and fair competition on the market for vehicle repair services, and services providing information about their maintenance. To this end, it would be a good idea to establish the technical specifications that should be available on manufacturers’ websites.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the inclusion in the text of the Regulation on two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles of the amendment proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, requiring that, where importers have reason to believe that a vehicle, system, component, separate technical unit, spare part or tool is not in conformity with the requirements of this Regulation, and in particular does not correspond to its type-approval, they shall not make it available on the market, allow it to be used, or allow the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to be registered, until its compliance has been re-confirmed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very good report.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In terms of the operation of the single market, it is important for harmonised type-approval for machinery and devices to be in place in the EU. This regulation will significantly help European manufacturers of, among other things, tractors, because mutual recognition of type-approval will provide the industry with better conditions than now to expand their operations to other (the speaker’s microphone stopped working) … point of view, the regulation is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For example, machinery and devices occupy a significant place in the work of agricultural and forestry businesses and also, unfortunately, frequently present dangers. There have been many industrial accidents, so agricultural businesses can never be too careful about occupational safety. The safety of machinery and devices is an essential part of a safe working environment. Harmonised European type-approval is therefore very important to ensure that each European farmer and forestry worker can work with safe machinery.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The high levels of occupational safety and environmental protection are also important factors in this regulation. National flexibility should, however, have a place in the regulation because it is good for small manufacturers to have the opportunity to gain national type-approval. It eases the administrative burden on small manufacturers because many of them sell machinery only within individual Member States. It is also important that maximum speed limits for agricultural and forestry vehicles are set nationally.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, especially Mr Panzeri, who has demonstrated excellent skills as a mediator. The debate relates to two regulations which address similar and highly technical subject matter: in one case, the approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles, and, in the other, that of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles. Discussion in committee and with the Council has resulted in a well-supported compromise agreement and an almost unanimous vote in favour. The rationale for the provisions is that of simplifying the current legal framework and of introducing new administrative and technical requirements on environmental and safety aspects.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards vehicles used for particular agricultural and forestry purposes, the starting point was the consideration that, since the numbers of such vehicles are limited, there was no need to burden them excessively with requirements on environmental and technical performance. Agreement was also reached on four-wheel vehicles, called quadricycles, dividing them into two categories: those used for sporting purposes and as private vehicles, and those used exclusively in agriculture and forestry. It is clear that quadricycles used in agriculture and forestry must be adapted and hence differentiated from products intended for ordinary transport. Another positive aspect is that agreement was reached with the manufacturers of these vehicles on access to repair and maintenance information.</p>
      <p sl="it">Where motorcycles are concerned, the environmental requirements considered will not be excessively onerous for the manufacturers to adapt to, inasmuch as they represent less than 3 % of the total mileage undertaken by road transport and so, by analogy, they have almost no influence on air pollution. My vote on the two measures will therefore be in favour, particularly since manufacturers and indeed users have, for too long now, been awaiting regulations which are clearer, more precise and simpler and easier to apply.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Thank you, Madam President. I have to say that I am very satisfied with the work that has been done by the rapporteur, Wim van de Camp. He, himself, rides a motorbike and I think that that is very important in terms of the report. In my role as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I received many emails from European motorbike riders about this matter and I believe that Mr van de Camp has achieved a fair balance. This touches on one of Parliament’s main objectives: road safety. I am particularly pleased with the emphasis on the anti-lock brake system and the combined brake system, and on the requirement for properly fitted daytime running lights. We know that motorbike riders are eight times more likely to be involved in an accident than drivers of other types of vehicles. We cannot deny this. I hope that the motorbike riders will understand why this legislation is so very important. I am pleased that there was a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Mr van de Camp, on behalf of the European Parliament, even though it took a long time to get to that point. At long last, we have legislation that is coherent and appropriate. We Europeans must work together to reduce the number of deaths on our roads. As regards the other report, that is, the Panzeri report on agricultural or forestry vehicles, I am reasonably satisfied that the rapporteur has reached a good enough balance in order to avoid red tape. I believe that this report is good for the environment, for the internal market and for the cross-border market for these agricultural and forestry vehicles, and I hope that it will help to create a competitive market for these vehicles in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the number of road accidents involving riders of two-wheeled motorised vehicles is much too high and must be reduced. The risk they run is higher than for car drivers. I welcome the simplification of the current legal framework and feel that, in this context, greater importance should be given to the environmental, safety and market supervision aspects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, we should be aiming to improve the internal market and to protect essential public interests. This is the only way we can achieve more efficient, safer and more environmentally friendly urban mobility. I think that innovation in vehicles and the economic aspects of the proposal are of major importance. To supervise the European market more effectively, clear stages and compulsory criteria need to be established.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madame President, the compromise reached with the Council paves the way for a clearer and simpler legal framework for motorbikes. The increased safety requirements are of paramount importance – given the vulnerability of bikers on our roads, who account for a disproportionately high proportion of road accident fatalities – but we also need to be able to explain the advantages of legislative reform to our constituents in a clear and grounded fashion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier this year, I asked the Commission to provide me with detailed data on our benchmarks on the relative performance of anti-lock braking systems on tar and chip road surfaces, which are estimated by the Irish Department of Transportation to account for 85 % of the total Irish road network. In its response, the Commission simply referred me to its impact assessment which is based on scientific literature and post-accident data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Needless to say, I read the impact assessment and, had the data been explicitly quoted, I would not have needed to ask the Commission for further information. I must now, therefore, reiterate my request to the Commission to forward such data to me so that I can properly inform my constituents of this proposal’s benefits in terms of safety.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, we have an Italian evening today in the European Parliament, with Madam President from Italy and the Vice-President of the European Commission from Italy, and the subject of our debate is of great importance. I speak as a former member – for two and half years – of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I think today’s debate is all the more important because – although it is a fact that not everything can be regulated by legal provisions, and I am against that – in this particular case, such provisions are necessary. The number of accidents involving motorcyclists, including fatal accidents, is appalling, in my country too. In this very Chamber, we have a colleague from Poland, a member of the European Parliament, who miraculously avoided death in a motorcycle accident – although he is not here today at this time (a pity, because he might have something to say on the matter). I believe these regulations are necessary, and it is good that we are adopting them. They have my full support.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, simplification of the rules for approval and operation of small motor vehicles, three-wheeled vehicles, motorcycles and mopeds will surely be good news for users of such means of transport, as long as this does not make the use of their equipment more complicated for them. However, the new safety and environmental measures will probably cause manufacturers and retailers some more serious concerns. Also, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock braking systems for this category of vehicles will also certainly be reflected in higher product costs. Equally, tighter emission requirements will force manufacturers into even greater modernisation of production – and further increase the price of these vehicles. Let us hope that greater safety for users and greater consideration for the environment will be appropriate compensation for the higher prices required by the new European legislation, and let us trust that our citizens will also see it that way.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, Mr Manders has raised an important point: this does indeed seem, at first sight, to be a debate that could take place in a specialist forum. In reality, this is not the case, because we have together achieved important political results by approving these two legislative texts.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, these are standards which will lead to improvements in road safety and help to protect our fellow citizens; they are standards which simplify the previous legislation – and this is another measure that meets the demands of our fellow citizens – and they are standards which provide better protection for the environment and, at the same time, help our enterprises, whether large or small, operating in the motor-vehicle sector. I would like to emphasise, in particular from the point of view of small and medium-sized enterprises, as Ms Gáll-Pelcz and Mr Harbour have reminded us, that we have seized the opportunity to adapt the rules governing type-approval, both for light vehicles and for agricultural and forestry vehicles, to technical progress – another political victory.</p>
      <p sl="it">In both groups of vehicles, technology has undergone rapid development, which is destined to continue under the impetus of European industry. From the point of view of regulation, it is, of course, always a challenge to keep pace with technical progress, but, in this case, we have succeeded. These are factors that are essential to a competitive European industry and which will ensure entry into the market of safe, environmentally sound vehicles that are exclusively of benefit to our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Manders is not here, but I would like to respond to the point he raised about counterfeiting and market surveillance. I have just returned from the Anti-Counterfeiting Conference, which was held in Milan today, and I confirmed the commitment of the Commission, not only as regards the toys, rubber and footwear sectors but also in the automotive sector, pointing out that the text approved by the Commission for CARS 2020 obliges me to proceed with the same determination in respect of surveillance of and counterfeiting in the internal market. We intend to take the same line for the two vehicle sectors we have been discussing today: the objective is therefore to improve the legislative measures that regulate conformity of production and to identify and define the obligations of the economic operators in the supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="it">A third aspect: to clarify the role and responsibility of the approval bodies in the Member States and those in charge of market surveillance. Since the Commission does not have its own police force, we rely on the commitment of the Member States to be vigilant about counterfeiting. Fourth point: the commitment to establish a forum to coordinate the market surveillance activities between the Member States and the European Commission. Fifth point: to strengthen the requirements as regards competition, and the technical service obligations and performance that result in the approval of a vehicle. I have also noted the request made by Ms Prendergast, to whom we shall send all the information she asked for so that she can inform her constituents. It is a shame that she has left the Chamber, but we shall contact her because, apart from the impact assessment, we shall provide her with all the elements in our possession.</p>
      <p sl="it">I can only thank once again the two rapporteurs: I cannot make a gift of a motorcycle to Mr van de Camp nor a tractor to Mr Panzeri, but I think everyone who uses motorcycles and tractors will be grateful to both of them for the work they have done to make the lives of users of these vehicles more straightforward and pleasant.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, firstly I thank the Commissioner for the answers and also my colleagues, nearly all of whom are now going home, for the compliments and the support I have received.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have listened carefully to the Commissioner. He says he will keep a close watch on the lead time for the industry and that the delegated and implementing acts will not go on for too long, so that the industry will have enough time to implement the new Regulation. He has not explicitly come back to the research into the ABS on small scooters and the research for Euro 5, which is to come in 2016. I assume, however, that that is also noted and that it is being taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have one more question, but that must be an observation in view of this debate. Will the communication on this Regulation become clear? We are, in fact, simplifying enormously, we are making maintenance and repair information very accessible. I think it is good for the EU to provide good information on that point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would say to Mr Bufton that, if he had taken part in the debate earlier, he would have been able to exert an influence on the whole issue. However, it is the first time I have seen him this evening and, of course, that is a real shame. One more thing: I have actually bought a new BMW motorbike for next year. I think that is good for the European industry, rather than a Japanese bike.</p>

      <p sl="it">I do not think there is anything more to add: the debate has shown the degree of consensus surrounding the proposed regulation on agricultural and forestry vehicles. Now I hope that this consensus will be completely confirmed in the vote in the Chamber. This is what we have worked for, and so I really hope this result can be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The aim of this legislative proposal is to establish harmonised norms for the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles, so that the existing legislation on vehicle type-approval can be simplified. I consider that the new regulation needs to be flexible enough to allow both the ongoing development of currently existing vehicles and the introduction of new types of vehicle. The technical requirements for approval of agricultural vehicles in respect of many environmental and safety features have been harmonised at EU level to ensure a high level of road safety and safety at work, as well as a high level of protection for the environment. In closing, I would like to stress that the proposal helps the industrial sector to become more competitive and the internal market to function correctly.</p>

      <p sl="it">I welcome this regulation, which aims to establish a series of harmonised standards on the production of agricultural and forestry vehicles. It is an excellent legislative text, in which there is the proper balance between the need to guarantee a high level of safety on the road and at work and to protect the environment. Adapting to safety standards is not just an obligation; it is an absolute necessity. This regulation moves things in the right direction, since it covers every aspect of operational safety in tractors, both as regards their movement on the road and in the performance of agricultural work.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposed regulation significantly simplifies current legislation on approvals, replacing 24 base directives and approximately another 35 amending directives. The regulation was needed in order finally to harmonise the market for the agricultural and construction machinery sector too. I am delighted that the proposed approval at European level for all categories of vehicle takes account of cost-benefit considerations, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
