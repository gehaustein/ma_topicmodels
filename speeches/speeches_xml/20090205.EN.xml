      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0407/2008) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market and use of animal feed (COM(2008)0124 – C6-0128/2008 – 2008/0050(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, today we are discussing what is known as the ‘open declaration’. This is about transparency with regard to feed as the basis for healthy food for consumers, and it is about giving purchasers of compound feed an overview of what is supplied to them.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been a long road but, if we adopt this Regulation today, I hope this brings matters to a successful conclusion, and I should like to thank the Commission, which has helped us a great deal with its constructive work on the issues. The Commission encountered absolute political will on the part of Parliament to push through this open declaration, and also experienced a stubborn but fair debate with the Council. We can be proud of the results.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take a brief look at the history. We had the BSE crisis and, in 1997, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry issued its final report in which Parliament called for this open declaration. The Commission presented a proposal, which subsequently became Directive 2002/2/EC. In a compromise with the Council – this went through all the bodies – the Directive pushed through the open declaration, which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a ± 15% tolerance, and the exact composition had to be provided on request.</p>
      <p sl="de">That was a directive rather than a regulation, and Member States implemented it only very hesitantly or not at all. The feed industry brought an action to the European Court of Justice, and the Court gave the following first-class confirmation: apart from the exact information, the legality of this Directive was not in dispute. We then took account of this judgment in a further procedure in Parliament, and have now brought matters to a conclusion in the form of this Regulation. I had the honour of being rapporteur each time and, throughout this long period, I enjoyed extremely intensive cooperation with the Commission that was based on trust.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today we have a result that has been fought for hard but fairly, and of which we can be proud. It is also apparent that it enjoys the support of the majority in this House and of the groups. There are no amendments, from which I conclude that this Regulation will indeed be adopted by a large majority. Therefore, we have a good Regulation that brings about the open declaration in three steps – you know what they are – firstly, the components in descending percentage order; secondly, the provision of information to feed businesses with a ± 15% tolerance – in this regard we have not laid down a reservation of intellectual property rights in this legislation, but rather referred to the general legislation – and thirdly, the provision of exact information to the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also wish to point out that we have set up a register. No feeding or admixing of components will now take place in the European Union without such components being published, as they must be included in the register. This is important not only to the supervisory authorities but also to the public and to customers. From the point of view of the rapporteur, therefore, I can say that I am very satisfied with the result overall.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work on this dossier, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, who all played an important role.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has managed to steer discussions during the negotiations with great skill, and we are very grateful to him.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the EU. It strikes the right balance between consumer protection and intellectual property rights. It removes the burden of the pre-market authorisation procedure for bio-proteins, modernises the labelling of feed through proper information for the customer and places coregulation at the heart of legislative procedures. It improves market transparency through the notification system for new feed materials, facilitates innovation and competitiveness in the EU feed business and marks a concrete step against the misleading of feed users – be they farmers or pet owners.</p>
      <p sl="en">The result of the negotiations is the compromise package submitted for your vote, which amounts to simplification and modernisation of the current legal framework. The provisions concerning the so-called ‘open declaration’ allow for a more modern type of labelling. Feed materials incorporated into compound feed for food-producing animals will have to be labelled by weight, in descending order.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of this, the exact percentage of weight has to be indicated for highlighted feed materials, and in the case of voluntary labelling.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the provision that certain information concerning compound feed can be transferred from the competent authorities to the purchasers on grounds of urgency improves the appropriate information to the user in cases such as feed contamination incidents.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the Commission makes the following declarations. First, in order to adapt Annex III on the tolerances for the compositional labelling of feed materials and compound feed to scientific and technical development, the Commission and its services envisage taking up examination of that Annex. In this context, the Commission will also consider certain feed materials with a moisture content in excess of 50%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, with regard to the labelling of additives, the Commission will study whether the principles of information through labelling of feed could also apply to the additives and premixtures authorised under the Regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission understands that any urgencies relating to human and animal health and the environment may include urgencies generated, among other things, by negligence, international fraud or criminal acts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself, I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. I believe that the approach taken to this report is a model for the parliamentary work in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today’s vote does not involve any amendments, as the work on this was technically very sound and encompassed the entire political spectrum. I believe that this result is one to be proud of. It is a balanced result that safeguards the interests of farmers as users of feed, feed manufacturers, and all other links in the food chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">It improves transparency, and my group, in particular, sets great store by the setting up of a register in which the raw materials mixed into feed must be entered. Food scandals occur time and again and not even the new legislation will prevent this, as no European rules are designed to prevent criminal activity; but these rules will help ensure that, when these scandals do occur, it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think it a good thing that manufacturers of feed may provide further information on a voluntary basis, and I consider it an excellent proposal that, if they provide such information, this must be scientifically proven. I am of the opinion that this new feed law significantly improves protection and that the decreasing order enables farmers to see the proportions of each feed component and what is the best feed for their animals, and to choose accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I reiterate my thanks to all those who contributed to making this such a good report.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, as I have already done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups and also the Council for the work carried out.</p>
      <p sl="es">This work has allowed us to reach agreement at first reading and furthermore, has been an excellent running-in process for the codecision procedure that will be standard practice in our committee in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, at present, legislation on the movement of raw materials for feed and compound feed for animals, including pets – a sector that represents some EUR 50 billion in trade at Community level – is regulated by several directives and some 50 amendments and implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="es">The simplification of the legislation and its harmonised application are the main objectives that will doubtless be achieved by this Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has already debated the placing on the market of animal feed, back in 2006. We will all recall that we unanimously asked the European Commission, in future review, to endeavour to find a fair balance between the interests of farmers in obtaining detailed information on feed ingredients and the interests of the industry in ensuring sufficient protection of its know-how.</p>
      <p sl="es">The compromise reached on the main sensitive points of the Commission’s proposal, the open declaration of raw materials and the creation of a Community list of raw materials, is a good reflection, in my opinion, of this balance. Proof of this is the welcome the compromise has received from all those involved.</p>
      <p sl="es">In fact, by means of the open declaration, the compromise protects the rights of purchasers to be informed and of manufacturers to retain ownership of their know-how by indicating that information should be provided without prejudice to the 2004 Directive on intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no question, ladies and gentlemen, that in a relationship of trust between supplier and user, the formulae should be known, but it would not be logical to be obliged to give the recipe to the first client who came through the door. Many of us have drunk Coca-Cola for many years. Although we do not know its recipe, this does not mean that we doubt that the product’s characteristics are observed and that health standards are respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Court of Justice judgment previously mentioned strictly establishes that the obligation to inform customers of the exact composition of feed, if they so request, is not justified by a desired aim to protect health.</p>
      <p sl="es">That said, I must remind you that the competent authority will have access to the precise composition at all times and, as established in the compromise reached, any emergency related to human or animal health or the environment will mean that the purchasers will have access to precise information on the composition of the feed in question once the legitimate interests of both the manufacturers and the purchasers have been considered.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the list of good labelling practices, this remains voluntary for the professionals in the sector without at any time becoming a positive list of raw materials for the manufacture of compound feeds, as this is something that has not been requested.</p>
      <p sl="es">The legislation will include, at the European Parliament’s request, a new annex comprising a list of raw materials for animal feed of which the placing on the market or use is prohibited or restricted. This is information, whether an annex or a list, that the Commission can update.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, whom I represent, supports the compromise reached and has not tabled any amendments for the plenary. We are fully in favour of the position as presented today in this House and, as such, we will vote in favour of it.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="1965" name="Jan Mulder" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">I, too, should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe shares the view that the compromise that has been struck is a good one, and so we will be able to vote in favour of it later today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What matters most is for the intellectual property of the cattle feed manufacturers to be safeguarded. If we in the sector want innovation – as indeed, yesterday, we voted on a climate report – there is much room for improvement in the cattle feed sector too, so that the emission of all kinds of gases caused by livestock can be reduced. Well, this is a challenge we need to confront squarely. When cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate, they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure. This disclosure is, to my mind, safeguarded, as others have already mentioned, and could be done at the request of the government or a certain customer, for example. There is nothing stopping the cattle feed manufacturers from doing this on a voluntary basis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The ingredients as such are not the most important thing: the precise nutritional value of cattle feed is much more important, and should be correctly labelled. Everything that is on the label, such as energy, protein, and suchlike, is valuable information. In short, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will be backing this compromise. We will also say to the cattle feed manufacturers that if they wish to innovate in their production processes and their cattle feed composition, for example, this is a good compromise that will help them do this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the market for feedstuffs and their use in animal production is extremely important, because it concerns the health of hundreds of millions of citizens in EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unpleasant experiences from the past in the form of animal diseases caused by unsuitable feedstuffs brought about huge material and social costs in the countries of the Community. This is why defining the composition of feeds is also extremely important, in order to limit the use of improper feeds. Effective enforcement of the provisions contained in the regulation is also important, so that they will not be merely hollow declarations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Currently, when millions of people and even entire countries in Europe are against the consumption of food produced using animal feeds which contain genetically modified plants, those people have the right to know what is happening. Therefore, it is not only farmers who should be informed about the contents of animal feed, but food processing plants should inform customers about this on product labels. And this is not being done.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Several months ago in this Chamber, we debated the increasing numbers of obese people in Europe. This problem, however, in great measure concerns precisely the contents of animal feeds, because it is these contents which significantly affect the quality of meat. It is very good that in the draft regulation, much attention has been paid to the hygiene of feed production and to the problem of the addition of contaminated materials during production. That practice has sometimes been used by many producers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be no exception in offering my congratulations to my group colleague, Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, who has worked very hard on what must be one of the more technical dossiers we have dealt with. He has also displayed the wisdom of Solomon in striking a balance between the needs of the consumers and the very legitimate needs of manufacturers for the protection of their product and their intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what I would call back home one of the more classic European Parliament dossiers. Looking at our guests in the visitors’ gallery, it is pretty safe to say that animal feed labelling is probably not one of the most glamorous subjects they could have heard us talking about today, but it is crucially important and it is a real example of where this Parliament adds value, and where we can ensure our consumers’, our citizens’ and our voters’ faith in the food chain of the food they eat.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to remember where this issue came from. The BSE crisis proved that what we feed our animals needs to be regulated. This Regulation needs to be transparent, and there needs to be a balance struck between consumers’ needs and the needs of the manufacturers, but it can go wrong. It has gone wrong and we must ensure it does not go wrong again. This report is crucial in taking that forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have had numerous meetings with the industry in Scotland, and with consumer groups and the farmers themselves, and there has been pretty well universal support and approval for the way that the Commission and Parliament have taken this forward, and particularly for our rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">This dossier does add value. It is a good example of Parliament working. We often say that there has been good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. On this one, there really has been, and the fact that there are so few amendments being tabled to this report demonstrates that it will go through with a big majority. Parliament has had a good day today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the compromise achieved concerning feedstuffs does have certain advantages – it harmonises and simplifies EU legislation – but it also has fundamental flaws: it does not offer sufficient guarantee of the safety of animal feeds and of foods, it affords weak protection of the interests of the five million farmers who breed and raise animals, and it does not sufficiently protect our health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The access of animal feed users to information about the contents of the feed will still be limited by the protection of intellectual property rights. If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable. The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses. These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health. As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE? Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production. We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms. Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers, the environment and of us all. We only need to radically change our approach to agriculture, and in doing so to change our approach to current common agricultural policy.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="966" name="Jean-Claude Martinez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, what is good about animals is that the years go by and the problems remain the same. For example, we always mention jaw traps when talking about wild animals, and the question of transport, breeding and feed always arises in relation to farm animals. Animal feed is a classic case; it is a mishmash, a load of rubbish. Antibiotics, clenbuterol, growth hormones, even the remains of other animals, are used, and this is what the United Kingdom’s contaminated feed problem from the 1990s was all about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, today we are told that the junk-food era is over. There has been a 2002 directive and a 2005 Court of Justice ruling and, now, there is the desire to reconcile the market and profit – which is referred to as intellectual property – with consumer safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, here we find ourselves today armed with a regulation. Using the classic tool of labelling, all the components are going to be indicated, in descending order of weight, and there will also be an open declaration, an Annex III and a tolerance of +/-15%. Moreover, the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only two big questions remain. The first concerns imported animals which have not been labelled. Mr Parish is here; he has taken a great interest in animals arriving from Brazil, which are not marked and which have been fed clenbuterol. When it comes to the safety of these animals, we do not know a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">And then there remains the big question of imported feed, namely raw materials that have been arriving from the American continent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, this came in the form of corn gluten feed – molasses, oilseed residues – and, today, it is in the form of transgenic soya from Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and transgenic maize from Canada and the United States. And this, dare I say it, because people are against local GMOs, but not immigrant GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is, we are talking here about two-thirds of the feed of our herds, and that is a real health issue. The single issue of European health security is obscuring the wider issue of global health risks, due to the Uruguay Round agreement and the Blair House agreement, which oblige us to import our oilseeds to feed two-thirds of our herds.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="4528" name="Neil Parish" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on their excellent work and the good cooperation we have had.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say to the last two speakers and to the guests we have in the gallery: please eat your food safely this afternoon when you have your lunch, because, if we are to believe the last two speakers, there is nothing safe to eat anywhere as far as I can see!</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole idea of this legislation is to bring safety to the food we eat, and, of course, what our animals eat is essential because we eat those animals. I know it is a very simplistic approach to take, but that is exactly why we are here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we have made mistakes over the years, and I would be the first to admit that the feeding of meat and bone meal back to cattle caused the BSE problem – which was not anybody’s finest hour – and that is why we are bringing this legislation forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole argument now is not about whether we should have transparency and have the ingredients on the label, because that is precisely what will be there. The manufacturers’ argument was to ask whether they had to put the precise percentages, because somebody could then turn round and copy that feed and make exactly the same feed.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is where the compromise and the work that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the Commission and Council have done is so good, because we have reached a situation now where we can really trust our feed. If you have looked recently at the problems that we have had in Europe – and we have had problems in various countries with animal feed – this is not because the labelling system and the processes have been wrong, but because companies have broken the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we must ensure not only that we get this law right but also that the Commission and Member States monitor this law and inspect the feed companies to make sure that they are not breaking the rules, because, again, people and consumers must have confidence in our food.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say to you that European food is as safe as we can get it, but we must never let up, to make sure that our consumers are absolutely satisfied that what they are eating is safe. I would say to our guests: please go and have a good lunch and be assured that it should be safe!</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="28373" name="Bogdan Golik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I heartily congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on another excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Efforts at simplifying current legislation in the area of the marketing and use of feedstuffs and in the area of required and additional information placed on packaging and in freight documentation are a justified step.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is certain that simplifying technical provisions and an enlargement of purely administrative provisions will have a beneficial effect on the growth of competitiveness of the EU feedstuffs sector and on food safety, which Mr Parish has just spoken about. I am certain that this assumption is itself justified.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I would like to draw attention here to a question which may be problematic. I think that the obligation to label products with a freephone number placed on small and medium-sized producers of feedstuffs for domestic pets is unnecessary. Introduction of this provision may cause a financial burden which is too great for these small and medium-sized producers, and most feedstuff producers fall into these two categories.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summary, I would like to stress that we must strive to simplify the entire system of legislation in the area of the marketing and use of feedstuffs. In so doing, care should be taken over safety. However, the introduction of controversial provisions which generate excessive costs may unfavourably affect precisely those small businesses which produce for local markets.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr zu Baringdorf, for the thorough work he has done in preparing for this debate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Food safety in the EU has been shaken by many crises in recent years, such as BSE and several dioxin scandals, the latest of which apparently occurred last autumn. The causes of the crises have often been found to be contaminated feed, due to negligence or even criminal activity. This regulation to simplify and clarify legislation is welcome. The regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the European food chain. Consumers need to be protected and they must be able to tell where and how the food they buy has been produced.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another objective is the legal protection of farmers. They have to make choices on the basis of labelling, and they must be able to have faith in the impeccable quality of feed. The manufacturing rights of the producers of feed must also be safeguarded, as Mr Mulder said earlier on.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In many Member States, things are well under control, but the regulation before us, which will make labelling clearer and make it easier to trace the origin of feed, is needed to ensure things are put right throughout the EU, and to end differences of opinion when it comes to interpretation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation, and others, that there is proper implementation and monitoring. Clear and precise regulations will not help unless they are complied with in practice. When monitoring the quality of feed, it needs to be ascertained that it is safe and fit for purpose and that it meets the legal requirements. This way we can improve the safety of the entire food chain and protect consumers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few years ago in Italy, it was claimed that foodstuffs mixed in the shed by farmers were to be considered as feed, and thus the sheds were to be considered as feed factories. Agricultural producers would never have been able to comply with complex health regulations, HACCP and traceability, and would therefore have been forced to purchase from real feed factories the foodstuffs that had been made on the farm for centuries. At the time, we managed to avoid this snare.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report that we are debating today defines feed but not feed factories. So that Europe does not get the blame once again, it must be crystal clear that foodstuffs for livestock, mixed on the premises of the livestock company, does not constitute feed, but simply extemporaneous mixing of foodstuffs and raw materials produced directly in the fields, and that the agricultural business is not a feed factory. Perhaps it is a partisan position, but one can never be too careful when interpretations have considerable economic significance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the aftermath of the dioxin contamination in the Republic of Ireland which visited such losses on innocent producers and processors in Northern Ireland, we discussed new measures on the labelling of feedstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The obvious question for me is: would any of these proposals have saved my producers from their present losses? Sadly, the answer is ‘no’. They will, of course, impose greater transparency which is, of itself, all to the good, but only in respect of EU feedstuffs fed to animals within the EU, not in respect of feed fed to animals whose meat we then import into the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Providing maximum detail on the precise composition of feedstuffs is right and understandable, but we must not so undermine intellectual property rights as to make them meaningless. In that respect, I have some residual fears on aspects of these proposals. Compound mixes are trade secrets built up over years of research and trial. They must be adequately protected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust that the 15% margin in description precision will be enough. I, for one, do not want to see feed mills in my constituency, which have worked hard and invested heavily in producing premium product, being gazumped and their intellectual property rights raided by manufacturers operating in cheaper production areas, either within or outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust this regulation will not be either misused or abused in that regard. Yes, farmers are entitled to maximum information on compound contents, but within the confines of preserving the viability and the future of the mills from which they buy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I should like to echo all the compliments that have already been paid to our rapporteur. Needless to say, public and animal health should be at the heart of cattle feed legislation. This translates into clear rules regarding the use and labelling of raw materials. This should, of course, remain workable and not lead to a greater administrative burden or, as has already been mentioned, jeopardise the manufacturers’ intellectual property. We will continue to monitor this with a critical eye, but it looks as if the new regulation will meet these requirements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to make an observation with regard to inspection. Once again, effective controls and sanctions to separate the wheat from the chaff will make or break this legislation. The regulation stipulates that the penalties which the Member States may apply themselves must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would urge the European Commission to closely monitor the situation in the near future, to make sure this is the case in all the countries of the European Union. It is, after all, unacceptable for one country to be stricter than another. An excellent case in point is, to my mind, the suspended sentences that were given this week, ten years after the event, in the Belgian dioxin scandal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I should like to mention a topic that cannot remain untouched, namely meat and bone meal. Following the emotional speech of the first speaker from the Non-Attached Members, I shall confine myself to the facts. Meat and bone meal in animal feed has been banned since the BSE crisis. However, in the case of chickens, for example, this leads to a shortage of animal protein in their feed, quite apart from the fair criticism that valuable proteins are destroyed. Moreover, animal feed is the largest overhead for the five million cattle farmers in the European Union who have not got it easy to begin with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, we do not want to revert back to a situation in which animal proteins from within the same species end up in the feed. Cannibalism: never again! We need to put tests in place in order to handle this situation properly. The European Commission has indicated that these tests could be available in 2009, which means that meat and bone meal could be reintroduced in the feed of chickens or pigs, for example, in a safe manner. I should like to find out from the European Commission what the latest is on this score and what steps we can expect in this respect in the coming year.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the quality of food products of animal origin (meat, eggs, milk) and the protection of consumers against poor food quality has been a subject of EU interest for many years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For products of animal origin to be of good quality, good quality feedstuffs are essential – this is the most important factor – as well as suitable living conditions for the animals. Most of the ingredients of feedstuffs are produced by agriculture itself, but the additives which are used are most often chemical products. It is these which create the most controversy. Therefore, we should fight for the exact composition of industrial feedstuffs to be declared. It has nothing to do with intellectual property rights and their protection. Only when a patent office grants a protection certificate is a product protected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When they have not been tested sufficiently, new animal feed additives may be harmful to our health, although they ensure the best growth or the best appearance of the product. A farmer does not have the facilities to test feedstuffs and can only rely on information supplied by the producer. We should remember BSE and the results of adding meat and bone meal to animal feeds. Industry will do everything for profit. This is why I support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s report in its entirety.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-024" speaker_id="23787" name="Czesław Adam Siekierski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I hope that the proposals contained in the compromise package which we are debating today will bring about the simplification of provisions in the area of the marketing of feedstuffs and that in so doing, they will raise the competitiveness of the feedstuffs sector in the European Union. I also hope that the new rules will not increase costs for small and medium-sized producers of animal feed mixes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When discussing the subject of labelling, it should be remembered that often the problem is not a lack of information on the product label, but a lack of understanding on the part of the ordinary consumer. Too much information on the label may actually hinder the buyer when making a choice. On the one hand, we must ensure that our citizens have access to information, while on the other, we must safeguard the intellectual property rights of producers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I endorse the idea of drawing up a list of ingredients which may not be fed to animals. One thing is certain – we cannot allow a repeat of food-related scandals. Irish pork contaminated with dioxins or melanin in milk from China are examples of incidents which should not have happened. We ought to ask why the monitoring system did not function correctly and why the contamination arose.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The system of monitoring therefore requires greater supervision. Procedures must be transparent and unambiguous. Fines for not complying with the monitoring system or for breaching it should be high, because they are related to human health. In spite of the incident in Ireland, I would like to give my assurances that in Europe, farmers and producers maintain the highest standards in the world. Our food is characterised by its acknowledged reputation and quality. The food in Europe is safe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by giving my very sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. Not only in this report but also over many years in the past, he has always followed a clear line, which aims to achieve what we have achieved today: creating clarity for farmers and setting out clear requirements in the field of placing feed on the market and the use thereof.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, we are discussing the second step, and this, in particular, has become clear time and again. Commissioner, yesterday evening, last night, we discussed the first step: production. I should like to return to this. The type of production and the type of controls on production are the most important prerequisites for this report, to ensure that ultimately, we have healthy, safe feed from which to produce healthy, safe food.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to reiterate my conviction that businesses that also process food to make feed should be subject to better scrutiny, that the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation – possibly for authorisation throughout Europe – as that has also been a problem in both yesterday’s and today’s debates. We need the same controls for the same risks throughout the European Union. Although we can never rule out abuses, this report and also yesterday’s debate have laid good foundations for safety without going over the top. This is another point made in today’s report, of course: that we have learned from developments following the BSE crisis, and that we now know that quite a few things can – and must – be done differently.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish to reiterate my thanks to our rapporteur, who has produced a good report today out of all the negotiations here. I hope that he receives one hundred per cent support from this House.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the excellent report by our fellow Member – whom I congratulate – on which we are going to vote today, is important because the European animal feed sector is one of our main agricultural sectors, both in terms of production, since it accounts for half of the agricultural production within the European Union – 120 million tonnes – and of turnover – around EUR 50 billion. Within the European Union, there are, in fact, 5 million farmers and 60 million pet-owning households.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the past, the European Union has come to terms with a number of health crises, which means that, today, we have to be more vigilant with regard to transparency, in order to meet the expectations not only of farmers, but also of consumers. The provisions laid down in this report have the advantage of representing a minimal cost for the industries and a great benefit for consumers, who are paying more and more attention to the quality of the goods they buy. Adopting this report will make it possible to limit the risks by guaranteeing better quality goods, better monitoring, more traceability, and better information for farmers and, therefore, ultimately, for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, with the increase in international trade, it is vitally important to strengthen all prevention systems, so as to ensure that the food crises that we have experienced in the past do not happen again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report succeeds in reconciling the right to information, while strictly defining the nutritional elements that must appear on the labels, with the right to intellectual property, which is so important when it comes to preserving the competitiveness of our industries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that manufacturers should actually be obliged to give immediate notification of the use of any new raw material going into animal feed, in order to guarantee transparency and to facilitate the inspections performed by the competent authorities. Including an urgency procedure that enables a new dangerous substance to be incorporated into the list of prohibited materials seems altogether crucial to me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equally, giving farmers the opportunity to question the competent national authority or the European Commission in case of doubt about an unfair allegation enables the system to be controlled better and customers to be protected, while fair trading is also preserved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore wish to offer my full support to this excellent report, for experience shows that a regulation on the labelling of animal feed that prioritises quality, transparency, traceability and monitoring is the best means of preventing further health crises in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support the idea that intellectual property rights are worth protecting. We cannot have formulations being copied by operators who come in and out of the marketplace, so the report is successful from that point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of rogue operators has been brought up in the debate here this morning. The truth is that we will only keep a check on the industry if we check those who do not comply. That can only be done by regular monitoring, inspection and control at every point along the way. We debated that very vigorously last night in this Parliament and I was glad to hear that improvements will be made.</p>

      <p sl="en">We do indeed need transparency, and have to know what is in compound feed – there is no doubt about that. I have no problem with a company keeping its intellectual property rights confidential. However, recent events in the Republic of Ireland, with the dioxin problem, bring home very clearly to all of us the need for control. Farmers can have the highest possible standards of livestock husbandry and do everything right but, as we have witnessed, all can be lost when events way beyond their control destroy all their good and hard work.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a good day for Parliament, and it shows what we can achieve through cooperation. Maybe it also shows what we can actually achieve within agriculture for a better future for farmers throughout the European Union.</p>

It has also proved possible to reconcile consumer protection and food safety with the necessary protection of intellectual property.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, yes, consumers and farmers depend on clear and transparent labelling, and I support the rapporteur’s amendment to allow the manufacturer to refuse to disclose information if he or she is able to prove that intellectual property rights could be infringed on any ingredient which constitutes less than two per cent of the ration. We urgently need more investment in research, especially into ruminant feed to reduce the methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, is it not long past the time for reference points for action, or RPAs, for dealing with the adventitious presence of minuscule levels of GMO in feed, rather than the present zero-tolerance regime, which results in criminally disproportionate waste of feed and cereal shipments and criminally disproportionate sanctions? I refer, of course, to the presence of previously authorised GMs by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), so that they are fully risk-assessed by definition, or perhaps a GMO that is fully authorised in another jurisdiction.</p>

We had opportunity to discuss this at length and, as rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has shown that a satisfactory solution can be achieved in a short space of time even as part of a first reading agreement.

If we now adopt new European feed legislation here in Parliament, by what will probably be a large majority, and the Council accepts this legislation, we shall have achieved a new, high quality standard in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to ask the two Commissioners present to insist on these European standards in the case of imports of feed and food as well in future. Europe can face up to global competition only if the same standards are applied to imports. Therefore, the Commission must also press for our European standards to form part of the WTO negotiations and to become a global standard – then we need not fear this global competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for their remarks, and shall now reply to some of those remarks. First of all, on the question of safety, safety of feed is guaranteed by the negative list of feed materials which cannot be used in feeds. The proposal contains the list of feed materials which are forbidden. The Commission will extend that list every time it is convinced that it is necessary to add to that negative list.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, I wish to remind you that there is a large list of maximum levels of contaminants, such as dangerous micro-toxins, heavy metals and dioxins, which has been in force, under the Directive on undesirable substances, since 2002.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would agree with all those who said, as I confirmed, that European food is safe. However, as I also indicated last night during our discussions, laws and regulations are as good as we make them, and we therefore have to remain vigilant and see to it that Member States, feed dealers and, indeed, the Commission, ensure that everybody sticks to their obligations in ensuring that laws really are enforced and that they are good laws.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent Irish meat incident highlights the need for stringent enforcement and controls on legal requirements, and my services will continue to examine how that can be improved. I am confident that, once the new rules come into force, regulation of the feed market will be significantly improved, in the interests of both feed manufacturers and users.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, I wish to express my thanks for the many kind words that have been said today. I believe this is a good report.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of whether criminal activity can be prevented, this report cannot do so, of course, but the improved intensity of controls it provides may deter such activity. Criminal activity always focuses where it sees an opportunity, where it sees loopholes, and we have now been able to close these in some areas. I hope – as Mr Nicholson said – that both the feed industry and farmers will understand that there is something to be defended here, that a community is being formed against these attempts to dispose of toxic substances via feed. I am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to make clear once more that we are not creating a separate line for intellectual property here, but rather making reference to the legislation already in force, which also applies to this field. We wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights. That is why this is a good arrangement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs. Here, too, there were arguments, of course – after all, we hold different opinions in this House – but I believe that what we subsequently created now has everyone’s support. I should also like to thank our committee’s administrative team – in this case Mr Emmes – who did outstanding groundwork. Although we Members of the European Parliament always play a leading role in the political field, in the administrative field we do need to be able to fall back on this groundwork. Here, too, this was very successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to add that, when we have codecision, parliamentarianism is fun. It was always said that codecision in agriculture would make everything much more complicated and time-consuming. This is not true, as we have seen that, given good work, a good understanding of matters, good groundwork and good political opponents, things can be staged very quickly. I think that this is proof that the expertise of the European Parliament can serve, and help, to set good legislation in motion.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0004/2009) by Mr Dumitriu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries (COM(2008)0431 – C6-0313/2008 – 2008/0131(CNS)).</p>

      <p sl="ro">I am pleased that we have this opportunity to debate in a plenary session an issue which is important not only for the Community’s agricultural sector, but also for the European economy’s competitiveness as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At a time when the economies of our countries are suffering as a result of the global crisis and when increasing the demand for agricultural products is an imperative, amending Regulation No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries offers us additional leverage to support agricultural producers and, by extension, the EU economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">European Council Regulation No 3/2008, which combines in a single text regulations 2702/1999 and 2826/2000, has accommodated the European Commission’s new political approaches on simplifying legislation, while also achieving the objective of facilitating administrative procedures within the European institutions. Based on this regulation, the Community can take information provision measures for a certain number of agricultural products on the internal market and on the markets of third countries, while also preserving the specific nature of the measures, according to the market in which they are implemented.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, nutritional value and food safety standards, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries. It also helps open up new market outlets and has a multiplier effect for national and private sector initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The amendments initiated by the European Commission are aimed at allowing interested Member States to devise a relevant programme where the organisations involved in drawing up proposals do not wish to present programmes to be implemented in third countries. As a result of this, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and also seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The draft report we are discussing proposes certain additions and adaptations to the Commission proposal, which are necessary in order to clarify and supplement the logic of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">First of all, we are proposing to introduce consultations with professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States, which are involved in the process of devising information programmes for agricultural products, both on the internal market and in third countries. In view of their expertise and the important role these associations and organisations also play in guaranteeing and controlling quality, it is absolutely paramount that they are consulted. At the same time, we support these programmes being drawn up based on an assessment of the need for them and their timeliness, providing us with the assurance that the funds are being spent effectively in programmes which meet the objective of helping promote Community products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are also proposing to extend the areas where international organisations can be assigned the implementation of information programmes for third countries. Promotion and publicity measures are also relevant to the wine sector, both on the EU internal market and in third countries. As is the case with the olive oil and table olive sector, international bodies exist in the wine sector, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which can ensure the implementation in third countries of programmes proposed by Member States, thereby disseminating information about the characteristics and advantages of wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another amendment which we are proposing to you is aimed at increasing the European Union’s cofinancing percentage from 60% to 70% at a time when it is increasingly more difficult for small producers to gain access to financing due to the financial crisis. Without any financial support, they risk going bankrupt as they do not have the leverage to promote their products and are facing a drop in market demand.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole. Attaining this goal will help us overcome these difficult times we are going through. The quality of the European Union’s agricultural and food products is an advantage which we need to utilise in order to guarantee the European economy’s competitiveness and higher incomes for producers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely deep economic recession. The measures being proposed will obviously not resolve all the problems linked to marketing and promoting the Community’s agricultural and food products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Simplifying the red tape involved with registering traditional products, introducing a ‘Made in the European Union’ label and solving the problem of products imported from third countries of lower quality and safety standards are just some of the areas which we need to consider in order to boost the market share for Community products. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments and questions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, and the members of the Agriculture Committee, for an excellent report on the Commission proposal on information and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal and external markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report. I think we all agree that the promotion of European agricultural products is of huge importance, both internally and externally. I am convinced that trade in agricultural products will continue to grow in the future – even if we have to admit that we face a setback at the present time owing to the economic crisis. However, there will be huge opportunities for our European products in third-country markets, and our promotion campaign should help European producers explore those new markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before going into the content of the report, I would like to put it into perspective. In 2008, the Commission adopted 42 programmes on the internal market and on third countries, representing a budget of EUR 128 million over three years. According to the rules, half of that amount was then to be financed by the Community.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of the Commission proposal is to make it possible for Member States to launch programmes cofinanced by the European Union in third countries – as described by the rapporteur – because today this possibility only exists for the internal market. It should also be possible for those programmes to be implemented by international organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The three most important amendments from the rapporteur and his colleagues are as follows: firstly, to make it compulsory for Member States to consult trade associations about the proposed programmes; secondly, to specify that implementation by international organisations is not only a possibility reserved for the International Olive Oil Council, but a general possibility, for example – as mentioned here today – also in the wine sector; and, on the budget side, to increase the cofinancing rate.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to those amendments, I would emphasise that Member States do, in fact, already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers. I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">My mentioning of the International Olive Oil Council is only meant as an example, because of the discussions that have recently taken place on the whole olive oil sector. It certainly does not exclude other international organisations, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the funding of the budget, there is, of course, ongoing discussion on the level of cofinancing by the Community, but we discussed this issue when merging the two regulations dealing with promotion and information in 2008, so I do not think we should re-open the discussion on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could I just take the opportunity to say that, when we agreed the wine reform, we did recognise the importance of promoting our products on third-country markets. Therefore, in the interests of spending the budget for wine in a smarter and more intelligent way, we proposed the earmarking of EUR 120 million each year for the promotion of our wine products on third country markets as a special budget line. However, since Member States – and especially the new Member States – did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that, if it was not spent, then it was lost, we included the EUR 120 million in the national envelopes, so that Member States can decide for themselves. In any case, this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products. I look forward to the discussion here today.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The report contains measures which will help open up new markets and make our farmers’ agricultural production profitable. This policy meets the actual needs of Member States wishing to promote their agricultural production, both among the Community’s consumers and among those in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It provides an excellent opportunity for the emphasis to be placed on quality, nutritional value, production methods and the safety of the food produced.

      <p sl="pl">Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries play an enormous role in creating a positive image of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand. I have been stressing this for a long time, and for several years I have been active in efforts to simplify the entire information provision and promotion system. In my speeches I have repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting the ‘Made in Europe’ brand in third-country markets. This is especially legitimate in the formal and legal conditions of today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In accordance with the Declaration of the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, the use of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect will be eliminated in 2013. In view of the complicated nature of organising promotional campaigns in third-country markets and the higher costs of such measures at a significant distance, particularly in Asia or America, the mechanism for supporting promotional activities did not attract much interest from trade organisations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposal of the European Commission allows for stimulation of their activity. Promotional programmes carried out by Member States offer the opportunity for entities to work together, where they have not managed to run and finance these activities on their own. Nevertheless, efforts to increase the percentage share of the Community in financing this type of project should be continued. I will mention as an example the United States of America, where several times more is spent on promotional activities than all the money allocated to wine and to activities in the area of other promotional products in the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the face of liberalisation of the commercial flow of agricultural products, an instrument to support the promotion of Community production in third-country markets might be the only tool available which accords with the guidelines of the Agriculture Framework Agreement in the WTO Doha Development Agenda Round. Promotion of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand is the chance to maintain competitiveness and, on a longer time-scale, even to strengthen the attractiveness of European agricultural and food products and to extend their market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank the Commission for these measures, which we have repeatedly spoken of in Parliament, and which have been included, and especially for the reduction in contributions from trade organisations from 20% to 10% and for increasing the funds available for promotional activity.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Dumitriu’s report and I would like to congratulate him on the work he has done.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This budget gives Member States an excellent opportunity to find markets both inside and outside of Europe. Coming from Ireland, I would like to say that selling our healthy, fresh, food products on world markets, particularly in Asia, is of great help to us in Ireland. Like my colleagues, however, I would like to say that I see a better opportunity here to simplify the rules related to this budget so that accessing the money supply for trading would be easier than it is currently and, of course, the budget must also be increased as has been said. This is very important, not only to the Member States, but to Europe as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with you that advertising is important. Yet advertising comes about not only as a result of professional offensives but also of occurrences in the region from which the foodstuffs originate.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the world associates us with BSE, when we have turned our heraldic animal mad, or when, as now, countries are issuing product recalls because of the dioxin problem – which, of course, is also going around the world – and when millions of slaughtered sick cattle are shown on television news around the world, this is also a kind of advertising: negative advertising.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must be careful to avoid contradiction here. On the one hand, there is our talk of good products but, on the other, there are the negative reports – but we are working on this, as we have just seen with the debate and what we have concluded.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we wish to advertise externally – yes, that is right, we have good reason to do so, as we have good products – I do not want it to be generalised advertising, but advertising showing European diversity. As you know, we have the situation in Germany where the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled against a kind of compulsory advertising with a compulsory levy. It pointed out that advertising that does not differentiate between the individual qualities does not increase sales, and that instead, it is important that the individual producers be able to advertise for their specific products.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, it is increasingly important – not only within Europe but also externally – to describe not only the quality of the end product but also the quality of the process. What is the situation with regard to animal protection, to the environment, to the ingredients, to the structure of the farming, to fair trade? These are all criteria that do not necessarily affect the quality of the end product, but are becoming increasingly important to consumers. We must incorporate this into our advertising too, therefore, and must see that Europe’s reputation in the world is further enhanced as a result.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to bear in mind that it is important to improve the conditions and support for information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products, both in the European Union and in third countries, broadening the scope of the proposals that the European Commission has presented.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore support the proposals of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, namely those aimed at greater intervention and strengthening the role of trade associations and organisations operating in the sector, in view of their expertise and the important part they also play in ensuring quality control, including the associations and organisations of the Member State that draws up the programme, as well as increasing the percentage of the Community’s financial participation. It is important that there is additional aid, especially for projects selected by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Likewise, we believe that promotion and advertising actions in third countries should be able to benefit other important products in addition to olive oil and olives, with emphasis on wines with designations of origin or protected geographical indications. In this respect, I will also mention here the important role of farmers’ associations, with emphasis on cooperative wine cellars and other associations of small and medium-sized farmers, whose existence is fundamental in ensuring the flow of the produce of farmers who, on their own, would not be able to survive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Once again, I would call for there to be enhanced support for these farmers’ organisations to be able to completely fulfil their role in upholding family farming and promoting the high-quality agricultural products they produce, which are essential in guaranteeing a healthy diet for the population of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We will therefore vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is a significant exporter of many agricultural products, but the future of EU agriculture will be determined by consumption in the internal market. Stimulation of this may bring benefits to farmers, consumers and whole economies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In many Member States, the consumption of food products essential for good health is not high, and its growth, by means of good information and promotion, is most desirable. However, it is important that EU farmers benefit from the programmes under discussion and, in particular, small and medium-sized farms, which comprise 95% of all farms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These programmes should enrich consumers’ knowledge of healthy eating and, at the same time, leave the choice to them. This is why it is worth taking the following steps: organising consultations with specialists in the field of healthy diet and training salespeople, who should also be consumer advisors in matters of healthy diet. Good presentation of information about the health benefits of the products being promoted, and about the way the foods are produced, is essential. Information on food labels is insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This programme may be threatened by the promotion of food mass-produced by large food corporations, which can prepare effective programmes and which have the best specialists at their disposal. Except will this not then compromise the promotion of high quality foods?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Legibility of the expiry date on products is also very important, as is a rise in consumer awareness of the significance of all the information which is to be found on product labels.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague for all the hard work he has put in as rapporteur in terms of simplifying EU legislation to reduce the administrative burden, something we very much need to do.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The information provision measures taken by the European Union are a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries, especially as regards quality and nutritional value, as well as food safety and safe production methods. As quality rapporteur, I greatly cherish this competitive edge that our European products have.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This legislative amendment will offer interested Member States the possibility to propose information programmes, including when there are no programmes put forward for third countries. As a result of this amendment, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The percentage rate of the European Union’s financial participation needs to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the idea that the organisation tasked with implementing the selected programme should be an international organisation, especially where the programme is aiming to promote the olive oil and table olive sector, not to mention the sector for wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, we must bear in mind the important role which professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States have in devising information programmes for agricultural products. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again, and especially Commissioner Vassiliou, because she has accepted all the proposals we have made within the report.</p>

    <intervention id="4-048" speaker_id="28427" name="Alessandro Battilocchio" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, above all during this parliamentary term, we have witnessed a steady decline in direct support for our farmers and in the rules that used to protect our industry from cheap imports from outside the EU, in order to free up the resources needed to meet the new environmental, economic and social challenges of this millennium and to comply with international trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="it">As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, most importantly, as a representative of a country that has earned worldwide recognition and respect for the quality of its agricultural produce – I am thinking of olive oil, wine and cheeses – I cannot help but approve of any action whatsoever that the Commission may propose to safeguard high quality European produce and to promote, where possible, the marketing of this produce both on the internal market and abroad.</p>
      <p sl="it">This information programme is, in fact, particularly significant, since it is to make clear to European and other consumers that our produce is not in competition with that, which may be cheaper, from other countries, but rather that it represents an alternative that focuses on quality and on a production model that respects the environment and social and animal welfare standards which, in turn, naturally benefits human health.</p>
      <p sl="it">The legislation that we vote on in this House every day can come at a price, above all for our producers. That is why we must offer them all the help we can, so that the richness and quality of our produce is not lost and does not become ironed out in an ever-more homogeneous global market. For this reason, I support the rapporteur’s amendments, which are aimed at increasing Commission cofinancing, adding to the activities that can be funded and, most importantly, increasing participation in producers’ associations, which are best-placed to defend the qualitative features of their produce to ever-more exacting consumers.</p>

    <intervention id="4-049" speaker_id="95019" name="Alexandru Nazare" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">Today we are discussing a report that is extremely important for European agriculture. As the rapporteur himself has emphasised, the quality and safety of European products provide a competitive edge which has not been sufficiently utilised yet.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Measures aimed at providing information about and promoting these products, their quality and the food safety standards they comply with may trigger a chain reaction by boosting demand, increasing farmers’ production and profits and creating new jobs, which also implicitly means economic growth. These measures must be directed equally at consumers in the internal market and those in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Let us not forget the competition we are facing on the internal market from producers from other countries, offering products which are sometimes cheaper, but where, very often, the quality and safety standards are much lower. Consumers need to recognise Community products and know why they are healthier than others. Last but not least, they must know that buying these products supports European farmers and agri-food producers and, therefore, the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I particularly appreciate the initiative from the rapporteur on recognising the important role which professional associations and organisations play because, in most cases, they have the expertise which the country’s institutions do not have. They are also much more familiar with the real situation on the market and its requirements. At the same time, I think that the proposal to increase the cofinancing percentage is an absolute necessity in the current credit crisis. I strongly believe that this will increase the rate of use of these funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, on all his hard work and his proposals, a view which I believe all my fellow Members share.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu. The agricultural sector is important for the Member States’ economies because it provides food for the population, agricultural products for export, not to mention a large number of jobs. The European Union must be able to provide sufficient quantities of food for its population at affordable prices.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is obvious that in a competitive market, information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries are becoming increasingly important. Professional associations or organisations must be consulted when it comes to drawing up the programmes for promoting agricultural products. I believe that this regulation will encourage European farmers to promote their agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania has a huge number of agri-food products which we do not, unfortunately, come across on European markets, even though many of them are environmentally friendly. A campaign to promote these products will benefit both European consumers and Romanian agricultural producers. Particularly at times of economic crisis, the agricultural sector obviously remains one of the sectors which must be given special attention, along with adequate programmes and funding.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In a crisis situation, Member States must focus greater attention when setting their priorities. This is why I believe that agriculture must remain an area which is supported because it is important for the European economy.</p>

There is a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, both among European Community consumers and those in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to highlight two proposals mentioned in this report. A request is being made for the percentage of the European Community’s financial participation to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">One of the most important amendments being put forward by this report is the 10% increase both in European cofinancing for programmes promoting European agricultural products and in the budget allocations for promoting the consumption of dairy products, fruit and vegetables in schools.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the one hand, Europe will benefit from a larger number of agricultural products being promoted more actively while, on the other, the biggest beneficiaries of the Community's aid will be children and pupils.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the measures which have been proposed are extremely important as, now more than ever, we need investment in the areas which are developing rapidly and can lead to economic recovery.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the major food manufacturers around the globe spend billions promoting themselves – maybe using EU-produced food, but concentrating not on its origin but on their own brands. We have celebrity TV chefs promoting their particular version of food production, with access to the airwaves and budgets of millions. And here we are talking about a relatively small amount of money to promote all of Europe’s food, both throughout the world and internally. It is a big ask! It is a very good report, which I fully support, and I endorse the comments of our Commissioner here today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly interested in the idea that we need to promote outside our borders, and I would agree wholeheartedly with that, but we also have to be realistic about how we are going to compete, and whether we are competitive on a global market. Perhaps the Commissioner would take that up in her responses. The question of our standards has got to be acknowledged and recognised. Is that being acknowledged and recognised at the WTO?</p>

      <p sl="en">In respect of my own region, I would very emphatically call upon the regional government – not one blessed with much initiative or with funds given how much it wastes on its top-heavy administration and needless cross-border bodies – to exert itself to draw down this EU funding, and thereby give our excellent local produce the best chance in the marketplace. Along with what I hope will be 70% support from Europe to promote food and vegetables to our schools, I trust this opportunity will not be lost by a lackadaisical local department.</p>

      <p sl="en">While I am very supportive of this proposal, could I be allowed two commercial caveats. Firstly, some countries, such as Ireland, may be unlikely to draw up information programmes if the trade does not show an interest. Secondly, while the proposed increase in funding to 60%, and to 70% for fruit and vegetable promotion would be very welcome in the current economic environment, realistically, the incentive to expand generic promotion may be limited as contributors and non-contributors alike will benefit from the programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I would like to endorse what you said. I believe the future of European agriculture policy is very much with the market. We have got to go out there and promote our high-quality products. You mentioned the wine reform – previously, we were taking a lot of low-quality wine out of the market, buying it into intervention and then making it into biofuel, which was absolutely the wrong way to go. What we should be doing is promoting quality food. We have got a great diversity of wines, cheeses, meats, olive oil, fruits, vegetables – you name it. Europe is rich in all these and we must go out and market them in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think, as we move beyond the Health Check into the new agriculture policy in 2013 and beyond, we have got to make sure that we use more money to promote our products and to link into the marketplace, because that is where the future lies.</p>

The requirements which we place on European producers are exceptionally high. Consumers should be aware of this, because it will affect their decisions concerning the choice of suitable products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am for promotion and information, although I more often speak of information as a more objective form of message. We must also have specific requirements and standards concerning the quality of information and the method of promotion. Finally, I am in favour of the EU and also national budgets supporting information provision and promotion programmes in the field of food. At a time of crisis, it is important to have promotion and information which will counteract the fall in demand and consumption, including food consumption.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks for all the contributions. It is great to hear such enthusiasm and interest in this important issue. I think that all the comments here are, to a certain extent, very much in line with the Commission’s view on the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the questions or issues raised here. First of all on the financing – this has been raised by quite a few of you – to increase the cofinancing rate. I think, though, that we have to be very cautious and careful when we try to monitor the benefit of the Community financing because I fear that if we increase the cofinancing, the bottom line will be that there will be less promotion. That would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Quality has been mentioned quite a few times today and I agree with you. I think we have a golden opportunity to discuss this quality issue that is also linked to how we promote our products in the Third World, how we explain to consumers what they get when they buy European.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last October, we presented a Green Paper on quality and we have had lots of contributions; there are more than 1 000 contributions on the website from all over Europe. We are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in May. We should take this opportunity when the discussion takes place here in Parliament on communication to make a link – how do we improve our possibilities to make it visible and make it understandable. Here the labelling issue, which is both difficult and important, comes into the discussions, so I am looking forward to having a discussion with you on this issue in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding the school fruit scheme which has been raised here today – it is not part of the proposal, but just to keep you updated – we introduced a school fruit scheme with a cofinancing rate of 70% to increase the awareness of young people and to take the opportunity to underline the importance of good eating habits among school children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, for a very good report. I think it is very well mirrored here today by the dynamic discussion that we have had.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to apologise if I run over my allotted two minutes by a few seconds. Thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report. I am confident that our remaining fellow Members will consider that the new regulations being proposed are appropriate and that we will vote in favour of them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to advise fellow Members that I will support their suggestions, especially those aimed at promoting European diversity, introducing European quality labelling and more consistent financial support from the Community. I have been asked: why wine, along with olive oil among the international organisations which can implement promotion projects? I would like to respond with another question: why olive oil then? My response is positive on both counts. They are highly successful export products from European Union Member States. They have powerful, experienced international organisations which have already demonstrated their ability to manage complex programmes. Indeed, the report’s provisions do not exclude other areas. As regards the second question about the 70% rate for cofinancing, the initial percentage rate was 60% and I felt that, in the current economic climate, it was necessary to increase it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As experience from the uptake of European funds has shown so far, one of the biggest problems remains how to obtain cofinancing, especially at the moment when we are faced, on top of this, with a credit crisis. This is why this rate needs to be increased, otherwise we risk ending up with the funds not being used. Mrs Fischer Boel, I would like to thank you for the importance you have given to this report, in particular for the views you have expressed. Although this is a consultation report, I hope and I would like these amendments to be included in the Commission’s new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To finally sum up, there are two reasons why this report is necessary. Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek assistance from the international organisations in implementing these measures. It assigns a greater role to professional organisations and associations in the process of drawing up and implementing product information and promotion programmes. Last but not least, it is part of the logic of the proposals for adapting European legislation in order to make the use of European funds more accessible by increasing the cofinancing percentage rate during a time when it is extremely difficult to gain access to credit. As a further recommendation, I would also like to mention that the report was adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Committee for the support they provided. I would personally like to thank Neil Parish for the support he gave me and, last but not least, Lutz Goepel for the trust he placed in me when he assigned me this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have not been able to hold a debate in plenary on this very important report, which is why we feel it is necessary, on behalf of the Committee, to take the floor before you today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have all worked together, and I commend the outstanding work of the shadow rapporteurs. We visited no fewer than 26 detention centres in 10 EU Member States, and we noted several key points. We observed, in certain centres, an obvious state of decay and an obvious lack of hygiene, and we denounced the failure to respect human dignity. We found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children’s right to education was not always respected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We call for respect for clear, fair, effective and proportionate asylum procedures, and we call for the implementation of a permanent system of visits and inspections of detention centres. We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres – something that these kinds of visits permit – and we must do so in order to take action so that things change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The press has asked me why we did not cite any countries in this summary report. I replied that it was my choice, that it was our choice, since we have a collective responsibility with regard to what goes on in detention centres in Europe, and the purpose of this report is not to rank the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will not stop calling for European solidarity in the area of asylum. We cannot leave the Member States, at Europe’s borders, on their own to face large migratory flows. I repeat once again: we have a collective responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="it">As we know, the European Parliament has wished for many years to express its views on small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent 99% of all European companies and 75 million jobs, while today only 3% of these SMEs access the foreign, external market and only 8% access the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are therefore asking the Council and the Commission to take account of these facts in multilateral and bilateral negotiations, in access to external markets, in the fight against counterfeiting, in the use of trade protection instruments and in competitive tendering. Trade is the key to greater prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank my colleagues at the Committee on International Trade and, most of all, the shadow rapporteurs of the two largest groups, Mrs Saïfi and Mrs Locatelli, and offer my heartfelt thanks to the secretariat and to Dr Bendini in particular. I believe that after all our work, we are today handing shared thoughts and proposals to the Commission, on a topic close to Mrs Ashton’s heart, as we heard from her opening speech as Commissioner, and one that must be tackled without delay if we want to resolve, at least in part, the serious economic and financial crisis that is haunting our workers and citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Clear definition of the ingredients of feedstuffs and the Community Register of Feed Additives will make it easier for farmers to make responsible decisions about the choice of the right type of feed. This is a step in the right direction.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in November 2007, I visited Uganda to meet with local entrepreneurs and local NGOs. As we were leaving Kampala on a dusty road, the driver drew my attention to some booths selling pre-paid telephone cards. He turned to me and said: ‘Those telephone companies, those private companies, have done more to take people out of poverty in this country than any of your white, Western NGOs’. I thought that was a little unfair at the time, but it highlights the feeling that so many entrepreneurs have towards European Union development policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, entrepreneurs in many poor countries have told me that they believe our aid programmes and our NGOs actually have an interest in keeping them poor. I still think that is a little unfair, but it highlights the fact that we need to show that we are supporting entrepreneurs in developing countries, and one of the best ways to do that is through encouraging open markets globally.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are now in a global economic condition with the global recession where there are the beginnings of the whiff of protectionism coming from the developed world, especially from the United States, and I hope not from the European Union. If we create a protectionist climate, then the whole question of trade, not aid, to help alleviate poverty will be blown off course and thrown out of the window. We do not wish the developing countries which do want to trade with us to be stopped by our own selfish needs which are misguided to protect our own markets. In the long term, that would be a disaster for our economies.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I voted against the resolution on Kosovo for two reasons. First of all, there is a paragraph that states that the Member States that have not yet recognised Kosovo’s independence should still do so. Well, a paragraph of this nature is in contravention of the principle of subsidiarity. It is up to the Member States themselves to decide, and they do not need any external pressure from the European Commission, the Council or Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second reason why I have voted against the resolution is to do with the paragraph that states that Kosovo, and the entire region, in fact, should have a clear prospect of EU membership. It is wrong, in my view, for Parliament to make promises of this kind. As things stand at the moment, there are many problems related to enlargement, and also related to a number of new Member States, and it would be totally wrong to make promises at this point to countries like Kosovo that they will be able to join the European Union at some stage.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whence comes our obsession with preserving multi-ethnic states regardless of the wishes of their inhabitants?</p>
      <p sl="en">Kosovo had an unquestioned right to self-determination: it was expressed in a referendum with a participation rate and a turnout of more than 90%. However, by an extension of that logic, so, surely, have those Kosovans of Serb extraction, who are clustered conveniently close to the border with Serbia proper. Why not allow them also to enjoy self-government? We do it de facto, so why do we not do it de jure?</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer is because we would rather keep Kosovo as a European protectorate – as a satrapy, such as it was in Ottoman times. We forced on them a version of our 12-star flag and a version of our national anthem. We have a Kosovan Parliament and institutions subject to the overriding decisions of an appointed European commissar.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should allow the people of Kosovo to have referendums on partition – if that is what they want – and on ethnic self-determination, and we should allow that same right to the subject peoples of the European Union. Pactio Olisipiensis Censenda Est!</p>

I wanted to draw attention to a very positive development in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. They voted an opinion which calls on China to respect women and children’s rights by ending forced abortion and forced sterilisation. It also calls on China to end political persecution and other human rights abuses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this raises the issue that we cannot separate trade from other factors. I made this point in the Gaza speech about our trade with Israel – if we do not bring up issues of human rights abuse, we are in danger of having our money used to encourage human rights abuse.

We opened our markets to China but China does not adhere to the terms and conditions it signed up to, and we have basically taken this lying down for a number of years. I am very much in favour of establishing a strategic partnership with this major economic player.

In actual fact, this amendment is still far too restrictive. Since Taiwan is a democratic country that enjoys de facto national sovereignty, it is a disgrace, really, that Taiwan is not recognised as a fully-fledged member state in all the different international institutions.

Overall, it was a very balanced report and I am very pleased that the rapporteur, on the whole, was able to stick to the issue – which was trade – rather than focus on a number of other issues that I know a number of colleagues wanted her to focus on.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I did have one major concern about this report, which was the reference to trade defence instruments. We have to recognise that consumers in my country – Britain – and in many other countries across the European Union, have benefited from open trade with China. It helped us at the time to fight perils such as inflation. However, protecting uncompetitive EU producers at the expense of other parties who benefit is something that we should tackle with care. We should make sure that we get the right balance and do not ignore the benefits of trade with China for consumers, companies with globalised supply chains and the retail sector. On the whole, trade with China is to be welcomed. Eventually, that will lead to all the other issues being tackled, such as better human rights and labour issues.</p>

      <p sl="fr">She appears to have forgotten about the way in which immigrants themselves abuse applications for international protection in order to bypass national laws on foreigners entering and residing in our countries, when their true motives are social and economic.

      <p sl="fr">She also appears to ‘forget’ that what she is demanding for these foreigners is often not accessible to our own fellow citizens, starting with decent housing, jobs and access to high-quality public services, particularly in areas in which, as in Mayotte, the tidal wave of immigration creates huge economic and social problems for the inhabitants.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the Member States of the Union are, for instance, being called on to remove the barriers to labour market access for these immigrants and to adopt national laws which, moreover, promote such access.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Must one conclude from this that, from now on, nationals will have to step aside in favour of the legitimate suffering of people fleeing their countries of origin, be it for economic, political, climatic or family reasons? Yes, and this is the meaning of selective immigration, which President Sarkozy wholeheartedly recommends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In contrast to this, we believe – particularly in times of crisis – that jobs, in Europe, should be reserved for Europeans, and, in France, for French nationals. The national recovery of the European nations depends on it.</p>

      <p sl="sv">() This report contains several points that I fully support, such as the fact that asylum seekers should be treated with dignity and that human rights should always be guaranteed. The criticism directed at a number of so-called reception centres is justified. A number of European countries fall short when it comes to receiving asylum seekers and refugees in a dignified way.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the report contains some points that I am unable to support. The essential aim of the report is that the EU should have a common immigration and asylum policy. Among other things, it calls on the other Member States to support those EU countries that are ‘most affected by the challenges of immigration’. The June List believes that asylum and immigration policy is a matter for the Member States, provided that international conventions and agreements are respected. A common immigration and asylum policy would run the risk of leading to ‘Fortress Europe’, something that we are already seeing clear signs of today.</p>

It confines itself to noting the tragic conditions in which they survive, but ascribes them to the poor application of EU directives.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thus, on the one hand, it supports the overall anti-immigration legislation and policy of the EU and governments, as laid down in the Immigration Pact and the Dublin System for asylum and, on the other, it protests about its inhumane results. It is, at the very least, insulting for the political powers of the ‘one-way street’ in Europe who voted in the European Parliament for the directive providing, apart from anything else, for the detention of ‘illegal’ immigrants for a full 18 months, to express in this report their alleged regret about their inhumane conditions of detention and to call for them not to be detained.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament’s ‘crocodile tears’ cannot acquit the EU of its inhumane, exploitative policy.

The more we try to broaden the concept, including what is not relevant to it, the less value it will have, and the confusion can only harm legitimate asylum seekers.

      <p sl="fr">We voted in favour of Mrs Muscardini’s report on SMEs. It is a harsh criticism of the European Union’s trade policy, even though it is worded in the toned-down and technocratic language that this House holds dear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It covers everything: policies focused on the needs of large enterprises; the weakness of measures promoting access to foreign markets and ensuring the application of reciprocity by third countries; difficulties in accessing trade protection instruments for small enterprises; the fallibility of measures to protect against counterfeiting and the illicit or fraudulent use of geographical indications of origin; and so on.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is small and medium-sized enterprises, and not the major transnationals, that are the victims of the market liberalisation promoted by the EU (as if a framework where ‘survival of the fittest’ rules could work in their favour). There are many small and medium-sized enterprises that ‘participate’ in ‘international trade’ by virtue of their dependency on the major transnationals, for which they manufacture at prices that often do not correspond to production costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Undoubtedly, it is necessary to provide (and implement) trade defence instruments, intellectual property rights, designation of origin and geographic indications of agricultural products, and to support the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am very pleased that the European Parliament has adopted Mrs Muscardini’s report, on which I had occasion to work as a consultant for the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Much is being said at present about the improvement in conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises in the internal market of the European Union, especially in the context of the proposed Small Business Act.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Small and medium-sized enterprises make up over 99% of all enterprises in Europe. However, undertaking business activity which crosses national borders is more the domain of large firms. Barely 8% of small and medium-sized enterprises export to destinations beyond their own national borders. If, however, we are talking about undertaking business activity beyond the borders of the European Union, this step is taken by barely 3% of enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not forget that internationalised enterprises show great innovative ability. And innovativeness is the key to competitiveness and growth of the European economy. I therefore hope that internal market policies will offer SMEs the full range of benefits which the common market brings, and when it is possible, that they will lay the foundations for internationalisation of the activities of SMEs. Small and medium-sized enterprises should also receive greater support from Member States and the European Commission, in areas including the promotion of exports or the search for potential trade partners, in particular, in relation to market-leading products and services and new technologies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report which Mrs Muscardini has presented concerns an important economic and social question. It is significant especially now, in the face of economic collapse. The number of SMEs (up to 250 employees; turnover ≤ EUR 50 million) in the EU reaches 23 million, which comprises around 99% of all firms active in our market. Over 75 million people work in these SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The calls directed to the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for effective support of these businesses, including unhindered access to loans, are therefore justified. In addition, trade needs to be made easier and bureaucratic export and import barriers need to be lifted.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In relation to public procurement, whose complicated and not always unequivocal procedures hinder the access of SMEs, the market should be made more open, both inside the EU and in third countries. As I have shown in my report on innovation policy, the role of SMEs in this sector is difficult to overestimate. This is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Special treatment is required for SMEs in the agriculture and food sector, where care needs to be taken over protection of the designations of origin of products, and imitations which are harmful to the health of consumers need to be resisted.

Another serious threat to international trade over the Internet is the lack of legal certainty and consumer protection.

      <p sl="pl">However, Internet commerce also gives rise to questions, especially about the sale of counterfeit products which are protected by intellectual property rights. Counterfeit products are a serious problem for Internet trade, especially because people who sell counterfeit products internationally cannot easily be brought to justice. Consumers who use the Internet are also often the victims of fraud, such as the theft of money by electronic means. All these phenomena undermine consumer confidence in Internet trade, and this slows down the development of international Internet trade.</p>

It also points out that it should be viewed as an opportunity for cultural diversity rather than a threat. Finally, it recognises that liberalisation of services connected to the Internet, such as telecoms, has led to a boom in infrastructure investment, so I believe we should be cautious about applying further regulation on such industries, as the Commission seems intent on doing at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Baringdorf report on the placing on the market and use of feed is of major importance to agriculture and the food market, in the light of recent scandals involving animal nutrition, diseases triggered in animals for reasons including a lack of knowledge of the ingredients contained in the feed they were given, the dioxin scandal, mad cow disease, etc.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Greater freedom and responsibility will be given to operators from the fodder sector. However, this means that if a serious problem occurs involving contamination with poisonous substances or harmful feed, this will hugely affect the animals’ development or the environment. If the producer does not have sufficient financial resources to resolve the problem, even more serious problems may occur.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think it is necessary, which is the reason why I have voted in favour of this report, for farmers and agricultural workers in general to be given accurate information about animal feed composition, but also to be sufficiently protected from financial, social and economic loss in the event of a disaster.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I sincerely thank the rapporteur for devoting his attention to such a difficult and controversial subject. Feed labelling and its coordination at Community level requires reconciliation of the interests of consumers, who have the right to know what product they are buying, whether it is safe and what it is made of, and the rights of producers, who want to defend their right to protect their intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The appeal of businesses and Member States against the requirement to place ‘specific information on request’ on feed labels shows the fundamental conflict of interests between these interest groups.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The compromise procedure worked out with the help of the European Court of Justice appears, at first glance, to be reasonable, but it is, however, detached from reality, for it is difficult to imagine a farmer who, while already working night and day in principle, is sufficiently interested in the matter to waste time and money on complicated appeal procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Specific information on the composition of feedstuffs should be available on the label, not only because of the inalienable right of the consumer but, above all, because of the basic objective of the directive, which is to protect health. Who, if not the producer, will guarantee that the feed has not been genetically modified, for example? The protection of intellectual property must not favour abuses.</p>

      <p sl="pt">While Article 36(1) of the Cotonou Agreement enshrines the conclusion of ‘World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatible trading arrangements, progressively removing barriers to trade between them and enhancing cooperation in all areas relevant to trade’, what the EU intends to do is to go beyond what is currently established and reach what, to date, has not yet been achieved in the WTO, even though the 10th European Development Fund is implemented for that purpose while, at the same time, reducing public development aid. In other words, trying to enter through the window after failing to get in through the door.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU’s aim is the liberalisation of trade, on the basis of which the major financial and economic groups endeavour to ensure the opening up of markets, to sell goods and services, exploit raw materials and impose a production model aimed at export, in accordance with their interests.</p>

In the case of the EPAs, a liberalisation process of 15 years was considered acceptable by the EU and the ACP countries.

      <p sl="nl">The own-initiative report about the influence of economic partnership agreements (EPAs) on development cooperation contains a few valid points. It calls for more government aid (after all, ACP countries take the brunt of the financial crisis) and emphasises that EPAs are a development instrument that should not adversely affect regional integration in the South. Despite this, I back the alternative resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. It would, after all, be more logical if Parliament waited to show its endorsement of the EPAs until the parliaments of the ACP countries involved had determined their positions. In my view, the parliamentary body that monitors the EPAs should be the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and not a body that has been set up for this specific purpose. This would only have a divisive effect and weaken the position of the countries in the South that do not have the financial or personal means at their disposal to attend all these meetings. Moreover, a separate body is non-transparent and would prevent a holistic approach to development-related topics.</p>

In this plenary, debates on Kosovo are usually not about Kosovo itself, but mainly about the effect it has on the rest of the world.

That is why most EU countries and the USA accepted the Aktisari plan. This notwithstanding, I believe that all unilateral declarations of independence are merely a source of future problems and potential conflicts.

The fact is, bringing together senior decision makers from the Chinese leadership and their counterparts from the European Commission cannot adequately address issues of mutual concern, especially in the areas of investment, market access and intellectual property rights protection and other strategic issues related to trade.

      <p sl="en">This report mentions China’s growing trade with Taiwan, which I welcome. Under President Ma, Taiwan has made great strides towards normalising its trade relations with China and trying to end the obstructionist attitude that Beijing’s communist rulers have previously taken towards commercial relations with Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, if Taiwan is ever to be fully integrated with the regional economies of south-east Asia, it needs to be accepted into international organisations, regardless of whether or not it is recognised as an independent sovereign state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given various health scares in East Asia in recent years related to the movement of goods and people – such as SARS, avian influenza and the melamine milk scandal – it is essential that Taiwan is given the status of observer at the World Health Assembly. Such a move would strengthen cross-straits trade, drive up quality standards in the region and elevate Taiwan on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The way that China has used its disagreements with Taiwan to play politics with matters of public health is to be deprecated. So too is the shameful silence that so many people in Europe keep in the face of China’s pressure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a humanitarian disaster is currently taking place in the north of Sri Lanka that is receiving relatively little attention. The Sri Lankan army is carrying out attacks on the civilian population that could even be described as massacres. A hospital has even come under fire and, according to humanitarian organisations, the overall situation is disastrous. The Red Cross has raised the alarm.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation in Sri Lanka has escalated, and the European Union is not blameless in this, having torpedoed the negotiations that were held under the leadership of Norway by placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations. This meant that negotiations within the European Union were no longer possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Sri Lanka itself, freedom of the press no longer exists. Recently, a journalist was killed. The German ambassador, who spoke at his funeral, was described by the President as someone who should leave the country. All he had done was to describe the situation accurately.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is talk of thousands of refugees in the north, and I must make it quite clear that the whole situation there is one on which we should be focusing much more attention. The European Union should be coming out very much more clearly against what the Sri Lankan Government is currently doing. The attacks by both the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE are wrong; it is clear that it is mainly civilians who are being hit.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to help the people trapped in the north and to achieve an immediate cease-fire, as it is quite clear that very large numbers of civilians are being killed there. This is unacceptable, and the European Union shares the blame for this if it fails to state much more clearly that the support for the Sri Lankan Government must end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war seems finally to be coming to a conclusion. The LTTE, which has been blacklisted by the EU as a terrorist organisation, must now surely lay down its arms and surrender. The EU and other Co-chairs have urged the LTTE to do so. The LTTE’s response will show us whether it really has the best interests of Tamils at heart.</p>
      <p sl="en">The LTTE is using its front organisations in Europe to maximum propaganda effect and raising money by extortion internationally. Some LTTE militants may even try to seek asylum within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout this ferocious 26-year civil war, the LTTE has pioneered atrocious terrorist tactics, such as suicide bombings, that are now used in many other parts of the world – regrettably. The Sri Lankan army has had, therefore, to deploy all the means at its disposal to counteract this brutal insurgency. However, it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the LTTE have been exaggerated. Some have now been withdrawn – for instance, the Agence Presse story of 300 civilians killed, after the supposed author denied authorship. Nevertheless, the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, the Sri Lankan armed forces cannot claim an unblemished record either, but they have not sought to deliberately exploit civilians and put them in harm’s way, like the LTTE has allegedly done.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the war really is soon to be over, it is essential that Sri Lanka turn its attention now to post-conflict disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. The marginalisation of Tamils, at the expense of the majority Sinhalese, needs to be addressed in an urgent and permanent manner in order to ensure a stable and sustainable multiethnic society with regional devolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should also ensure resources are put at Sri Lanka’s disposal to support post-conflict development. Although we should support the Government’s offer of amnesty for the majority of the LTTE, it is vital that no one responsible for the most serious war crimes is allowed to get away with impunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Sri Lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades. This tragic situation came about as a result of the armed conflict mainly between separatist insurgent forces in the north and the Sri Lankan army. During this fighting, thousands of innocent people were killed and injured and much destruction to property, infrastructure and the environment has been caused.</p>
      <p sl="en">This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated in recent months mainly due to the Government’s large-scale military offensive against the Tamil Tigers. Reports coming out of Sri Lanka indicate that the situation in certain areas has, in recent weeks, deteriorated tragically, with hundreds of civilians displaced and caught up in the fighting. According to Amnesty International, there have been violations of international conventions and human rights by both Government and Tamil Tiger forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">Admittedly, it is very difficult in such circumstances to be absolutely sure as to who is to be blamed for some of the tragic events in Sri Lanka, but we must call on both sides to exercise restraint and to pay utmost attention and respect to innocent civilians, and to observe the conventions of war.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the Sri Lankan Government has the upper hand in the situation and is the internationally-recognised authority in the country, our call must, by necessity and logic, go mostly to them. At the same time, we must call on the Tamil Tiger leaders to abide by the calls of the international community, take advantage of the Government’s offer of amnesty, renounce violence and seek to achieve their aims through political dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also once again advise emphatically that fighting solves no problems, and that lasting peace and stability can only be achieved at the negotiating table, which will inevitably happen sooner or later. In these negotiations, compromises will have to be made by both sides and a solution found which will be for the benefit of the citizens of this beautiful country. We hope that through this resolution we will help to lessen the suffering of the Sri Lankan people and to bring about much-needed peace in that country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Socialist Group in this Parliament is formally refusing to take part in this vote on Sri Lanka. Last month, Parliament held a full debate, with Council and Commission statements, on the situation in Gaza. On this side of the House, we attach the same importance to Sri Lanka and believe it deserved equal and proper discussion, but I regret that not one other group supported us in this stand.</p>
      <p sl="en">A short debate this afternoon with a handful of people on a Thursday is an insult to the thousands of people under attack and dying in the north of Sri Lanka. We wanted to call, as in the joint USA and UK declaration from Washington earlier this week, for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire by both sides, but the PPE refused to include that in the text.</p>
      <p sl="en">We wanted to condemn, unreservedly, the bombing of hospitals and aid workers, but Mr Van Orden, negotiating for the PPE, refused to condemn it. That is why it is not in the resolution before you. To him – and presumably to Dr Tannock as well – everything the Government of Sri Lanka says is a fact and just about every aid organisation on the ground, from the Red Cross to the UN, can be dismissed. Amnesty International today suggests the Sri Lankan army could be guilty of war crimes for its use of cluster bombs on a hospital – a 16-hour bombardment, according to Amnesty International.</p>
      <p sl="en">The PSE also wanted to condemn the murders of journalists and other media workers by government agents. Paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the Government – the very same Sri Lankan Government – to investigate their own serious human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, some of you may want to associate yourselves and your groups with those kinds of sentiments, but we do not. Vote for this text and you are condoning attacks on hospitals and ignoring allegations of war crimes. I note that Mr Van Orden has not even had the courage to stand here and defend his bloody handiwork, but I am hardly surprised. In our negotiations, he just dismissed and laughed off as propaganda allegations of rape by Sri Lankan soldiers, so what you can expect?</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Middle East, millions of people – including many Jews – were outraged at what Israel did to Gaza, but that did not make them supporters of Hamas. Sadly, anyone who does not support the Sri Lankan Government is labelled an apologist for terrorism and a supporter of the LTTE.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our motion was critical of the LTTE and their tactics. We do condemn their attacks and we do want them, the Tamil Tigers, to sit round the negotiating table, but this war must be stopped immediately. The Government must end its military campaign that has brought – as others have said – humanitarian disaster to hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in the north of the island.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, this resolution does not call for an immediate end to the fighting, so we will not endorse that approach by taking part in today’s vote. We dissociate ourselves, President and colleagues, from this motion and I urge anyone else with the same views to do likewise.</p>

      <p sl="es">I would like to start by saying that the resolution finally agreed is absolutely not one that I would have drafted. I believe that it suffers from excessive complacency in relation to the government in Colombo. I fear that it is another case of simplification, criminalisation and continued persecution of a group by simply arguing that it is a terrorist group. In fact, things are much more complex.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I do believe that the current situation is such that Parliament should send out clear messages about certain issues. For example, one of the key points that I consider important to emphasise is the Tokyo appeal on the need for both sides, namely the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and the government, to understand that a cease-fire must be agreed to allow humanitarian aid to get through and for the wounded and ill to be evacuated.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I think that it is essential to remember that there cannot be a military solution, Mr Tannock. This cannot happen, it is simply impossible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now is therefore the time to negotiate terms for the cessation of violence, demobilisation and disarmament. However, for this to occur, the government must stop seeking a military victory that merely prolongs the suffering of so many people.</p>
      <p sl="es">A goodwill gesture would be, for example, to allow independent media and humanitarian personnel to enter the north.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, in relation to the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, the GSP Plus, I am one of those who think that it should never have been granted to a country such as Sri Lanka, given the serious and continuing breaches of fundamental human rights in the country, many of these breaches being instigated by government authorities. I think that we should seriously consider opening an in-depth debate on the relevance of applying this preferential framework and, above all, on the consequences that it has for many groups, including workers.</p>
      <p sl="es">For these reasons I call upon the European Commission to carry out an in situ investigation to establish the effects of the measure and to review it if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the civil war in Sri Lanka has lasted 25 years. Over 70 000 people have died in the conflict. Today, between the Sri Lankan government army and Tamil Tiger forces, in an area of about 300 km2, around 250 000 civilians are bearing the drastic costs of this war. Hundreds of defenceless people have died in the conflict zone since the middle of January. There were around 500 people in the hospital at the time it was bombarded by artillery.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to the International Red Cross, the shells hit the paediatric department. The terrified people are afraid to flee, despite the 48-hour cease-fire announced by the government. They fear death or injury. Both sides in the conflict draw attention to human rights violations committed by the other side, and both sides violate these rights. The government predicts that victory over the Tamils is near. The people who are trapped between the two armies may not live to see the end of hostilities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as a member of the SAARC Delegation, I was able to visit Sri Lanka several times. I saw for myself on the ground how much the population is suffering as a result of the civil war that has been going on for 25 years and has claimed 70 000 lives. Fighting between government forces and the LTTE has further escalated. Large parts of the north have been brought under control and strongholds of the Tamil rebels have been taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">What human rights organisations in both Colombo and Jaffna told me at the time is unfortunately confirmed time and again: ‘war is an institution’. The humanitarian situation is alarming. There are refugees in their thousands. There is a lack of medical care and of food. Aid agencies must be given unrestricted access to the civilian population in a cease-fire to be agreed. The government has set up corridors to facilitate the evacuation of civilians from the combat areas; it is incomprehensible that the Tamil Tigers have failed to respect this safe zone, are continuing to fire and are using people as human shields.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Tokyo group, consisting of Japan, the United States, Norway and the European Union, has called on the LTTE leadership to negotiate the details of a cease-fire with the Sri Lankan Government at long last. The launch of a peace process is in the interests of everyone – including the Tamils. I expressly welcome the decision by the government to comply with the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and hand over the competent provincial council to the elected representatives of the north and the east. We also expect it to respect a guarantee of a careful, neutral investigation into the human rights violations we have just discussed and the violations of press freedom. Security and stability must not remain a pipe dream for Sri Lankans.</p>

What reports do we have to go on when all the NGOs, except the Red Cross, have been evacuated from the country since September? Who should we believe? The Sri Lankan Government or anonymous witnesses?</p>
      <p sl="fr">One thing is certain: the situation is developing into a final assault, into a kill for a government set on using force to put a stop to a rebellion that has lasted too long for its liking. Once again, who is picking up the pieces, ladies and gentlemen? All the civilians, women, children, the elderly, of course, who are stuck in the middle and suffering unbearable violence. This has to stop. It is high time the international community really put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government so that it stops this escalation of violence and killing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must adopt a very clear position and not make the Tamil civilians the people history overlooked and the martyrs of indifference. Our European Parliament must not stop at this joint resolution. We must demand an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, which will mark the beginning of a stronger commitment in favour of a peaceful end to this conflict, with respect shown for human rights and cultural identities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the dramatic images from Sri Lanka reveal that a brutal civil war that has spanned decades is coming to a head. As we all know, whilst it may be possible to end a war by means of weapons, it is not possible to establish lasting peace this way. In addition, there can be no effective, lasting fight against terrorism, in particular, by means of weapons, as terrorism always finds a way. Therefore, it is important to get to grips with the causes.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next step must be to reach a peace settlement based on the following fundamental elements. Firstly, a clear monopoly of power on the part of the unitary State. No State can allow ethnic groups or sections of the population to arm and engage in armed conflict. This requires, however, that this State comply with democratic rules and the rule of law and actively seek a political solution along the lines of autonomy, one that finally resolves Sri Lanka’s nationality problems, which are an old historical legacy and also a legacy of colonial times, and which need to be tackled urgently.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I wish to appeal quite clearly to the European Union and all the countries of this earth to help with the development of democracy and the rule of law, with the strengthening of autonomy and of minority rights, and of course also with the economic development of a country that has been bled dry so appallingly by the terror of this civil war.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, if the guns were to fall silent at long last – unfortunately we are not at that stage yet – this would not mean the end of developments, but only the beginning of movement towards a peace based on the rule of law, freedom, human rights, minority rights and national autonomy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Tokyo Conference signalled that the crisis in Sri Lanka might end and that there was hope for peace. However, a quarter of a million civilians trapped in the conflict zone need safe passage and they must be provided with humanitarian aid. Foreign observers must have access to the area in order to assess humanitarian needs. However, the recent attacks on journalists provide no guarantee of safety for humanitarian organisations. Although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists, that is no solution. We must also put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to sign up to the Ottawa Convention and to remove land mines. I am sorry that MEPs from the socialist group preferred to go home instead of taking part in today’s debate and thus defending their different views on how to solve the Sri Lanka problem.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the scenario of tragic events in Sri Lanka is similar to that of other such cases. In speaking of the tragedy of poor people, we forget that people are also the cause of the tragedy – not poor people, but people who come from the same environment. To gain power, they use religious, tribal and ethnic differences, historical misunderstandings and other available means to sow discord between sections of society in the country concerned. This leads to the destruction of usually very weakly rooted elements of democracy and to civil war with all its cruelties, to a disregard for human rights and for information, and to the total destruction of the opponent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I endorse the resolution as an expression of disapproval towards those who resurrect civil wars and towards those who give them material and political support. One kind of warning to the creators of such inhumane scenarios could be the awareness that they will be captured, for example, by international special forces, and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>

The press agency that filed the report withdrew that story saying it was erroneous. There are not 230 000 civilians trapped: there are 113 000 who are being used as a human shield by the LTTE. If they really cared about the Tamil people they would not use Tamil people as a human shield to protect themselves. What bravery is this?</p>
      <p sl="en">Sri Lanka has suffered 25 years of civil war. We need to help that country to remain what it has always been: one of the oldest democracies in the world. It has a longer history of democracy than 22 of the 27 Member States of the EU.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as one of the Tokyo Co-Chairs of the Sri Lanka peace process, the European Commission is closely following developments in Sri Lanka. We are deeply concerned by the current situation and the tragic humanitarian consequences of the conflict as expressed in the statement issued locally by the Co-Chairs on 3 February 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">We look with concern at the difficult situation of thousands of internally displaced persons trapped by fighting in northern Sri Lanka. Both Commissioners Ferrero-Waldner and Michel have already communicated publicly their preoccupation about the consequences of the hostilities on the civilian population and have called on both parties, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan authorities, to protect the civil population, as required under international humanitarian law, and to allow the safe and voluntary movement of people away from the combat zone.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is concerned about the information it has received concerning the conditions in which internally displaced people are living in the so-called ‘welfare centres’ once they have escaped from the territory controlled by the Tamil Tigers into Government-controlled areas. It is also important that international standards be respected in these temporary camps. UN agencies, the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations should have full access to these centres in line with international humanitarian law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission continues to be alarmed about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, against a background of reports of extrajudicial killings, abductions and serious intimidation of the media. It is very important that the Government follows up on the most prominent high-profile cases. In her recent meeting with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to take decisive action to tackle human rights abuses, including action against the perpetrators, and to guarantee press freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission continues to be convinced that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict. An inclusive dialogue is required to agree on a political settlement so that lasting peace and reconciliation can be achieved by addressing the concerns which led to the insurgency in the first place, and to provide adequate space for all communities.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Burma is known as a violent military dictatorship in which a caste of profiteers has been able to hang onto power for many years. Oppression and poverty have caused many people to flee the country, or to try to do so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The country’s ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship. In large areas, minority peoples are in the majority. They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship. The military leaders consider their dictatorship necessary to be able to keep the country together permanently and to subjugate the rebellious people. They are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it. By issuing major exploitation concessions to foreign businesses, vital sources of income are taken from the indigenous people, with nature and the environment being seriously damaged in the process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The need to flee the country is further reinforced by the fact that no consideration is given to the regional majority peoples. The regime is keen to eliminate troublesome groups, either by killing them or by chasing them out of the country. Many flee into the sea in makeshift dinghies, running the considerable risk of drowning. Burma’s neighbour, Thailand, has seen many refugees cross the border: according to some estimates, as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years, and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man’s land along the border.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, feelings of sympathy or solidarity with refugees are even less well developed in South East Asia than they are in Europe. Very often, refugees are sent home, even if this means certain death. Public opinion shows little interest, even if it involves people who share their religion, such as the Muslim boat refugees who ended up in Indonesia from Burma.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Governments also give priority to good relations with their colleagues in dictatorial states, instead of bringing pressure to bear in order to improve the situation there. Some in Europe even tend towards adopting a similar attitude, and we can see the disastrous impact this has in Asia. This is another reason why we should urge the Asian countries to find a solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this case highlights the plight of a minority in a country where minorities are at best marginalised and at worst brutalised. The Rohingya people have suffered double discrimination for years. As Muslims, they are being denied the right to practise their faith freely, a right that we in the EU recognise as fundamental, and their mosques have been damaged and desecrated. As an ethnic minority, the Rohingya people are systematically denied civil rights that most of the rest of the world take for granted: the right to marry, the right to move freely, the right to citizenship of the country they live in, and the right to a proper education.</p>
      <p sl="en">In praising our own progressive achievements in the field of human rights, we in the EU can tend to lose sight of the fact that many people in the world lack even these basic entitlements. We in this House are well aware of the plight of the people of Burma generally, but since the riots by Buddhist monks of 2007, that country has rather faded somewhat from the public consciousness.</p>
      <p sl="en">The appalling fate of the little-known-about Rohingya people, especially those fleeing by boat as refugees that are the subject of this resolution, has renewed our attention on the despotic regime in Burma, a country so rich in human potential otherwise. The brutality of the military junta stands in stark contrast to the action of Thailand, which has only partially, in my view, discharged its responsibility for the Rohingya refugees as it unfortunately alleges that most of them are purely economic refugees which I believe to be highly unlikely, and tried sending them back. Thailand must take more seriously its growing role as a force for stability and humanity in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">In contrast, we can expect very little from the brutal Burmese military leaders, impervious as they have been to our many pleas for years. I hope that the junta generals’ contempt for civilised opinion one day comes back to haunt them, possibly in an international criminal tribunal, when Burma is finally freed of tyranny.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the brutal regime governing Burma has, for some time now, been causing thousands of civilians to leave that country in search of a more secure future and a better standard of living in neighbouring Thailand or, via Thailand, in other South-East Asian countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Amongst these destitute people are the indigenous Rohingya community of Western Burma who, in recent years, have been the victims of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Burmese Government. Unfortunately, the Thai authorities have not provided those refugees with the humanitarian assistance they so clearly deserve. Instead, it is reported that these people have been fiercely persecuted. We call on the Thai Government to respect the human rights of Burmese refugees and to treat them with respect, compassion, dignity and humanity.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution also gives me the opportunity to deal with the issue of the 41-year-old Australian writer of Cypriot origin, Harry Nicolaides, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in Thailand for allegedly insulting the country’s Royal Family in a novel he wrote in 2005. Mr Nicolaides was teaching English at a Thai university at the time, and in his novel he only makes an anonymous reference to a member of the Thai Royal Family, and the incriminated work is clearly fictitious.</p>
      <p sl="en">During his trial, Mr Nicolaides was paraded in front of the international media in chains and told reporters that he had endured unspeakable suffering. Mr Nicolaides has apologised to the Thai Royal Family and has made an appeal for royal grace.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that Mr Nicolaides has been subjected to enough punishment and ill-treatment by the Thai authorities, who have handled this case most insensitively and inappropriately, and we call on them, as well as the Royal Family, to effect Mr Nicolaides’ immediate release and return to his home in Australia. To not do so would be most unwise, pitiful and damaging to Thailand.</p>

These wars would never be able to last indefinitely in poor countries, which would not be able to afford them at all, if there were not external interests behind it all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the treatment and discrimination of the Rohingya people appals us all. As a Muslim minority in Buddhist Burma, they are not recognised as one of Burma’s ethnic minorities. They have few legal rights and, as Amendment 3 tabled by Glenys Kinnock highlights, they face deliberate impoverishment, denial of citizenship, denial of freedom of movement, arbitrary taxation, land confiscation and the denial of permission to marry.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is no wonder that many attempt to leave Burma as they have no other option. The shocking reports that a thousand Rohingya boat people over a 12-day period, who, instead of being brought to safety by the Thai authorities who discovered them, were instead towed into international waters without navigational equipment, food and water and left to fend for themselves, sickens anyone with an iota of human decency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only yesterday, an article in The Guardian highlighted other incidents. The latest case involved 220 men, who were discovered in an open craft by fishermen. These refugees claimed they were detained by Thai authorities on a remote island for two months, and that they were beaten before being forced onto boats and left to their fate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The abuse and lack of international coordinated action to help the Rohingya must be addressed. Thailand must also take responsibility. The Thai Prime Minister must act. The problems of abuse at the hands of Thai officials must be seriously addressed. The Thai Government must sign the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 Protocol. As Joel Chamy, Vice-President of Washington-based Refugees International, said, the Rohingya need protection and asylum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thailand has said it is unwilling to grant that, but that is a problem that will not go away. There are ongoing reports of the treatment of Burmese refugees who enter Malaysia. Many of these people are sold as slaves, the women and children are forced into sexual slavery and the men are sold as forced labour onto fishing vessels. Some of this fish may even enter the EU market. I hope that today, we can highlight the plight of Burmese refugees and particularly the plight of the Rohingya.</p>

      <p sl="es">Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the people of Burma and the border between Thailand and Burma. There I saw with my own eyes the injustice with which we treat some parts of the world in political and media terms.</p>
      <p sl="es">All too often, we are only moved by headline news. What we have seen in Burma, which is now no longer on the front pages, is a drama that is not so different from what has mobilised us in many other cases.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have very clear examples of persecution, torture, illegal detention, rape and other atrocities committed by the Burmese military junta. One of the most shameful recent actions has been the adoption of a so-called constitution that violates the most basic democratic principles and guarantees almost complete impunity for all the acts I have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is quite understandable that people flee from this situation, as the Karen population has been doing for several years and, as we are today reporting in the resolution, the Rohingya people has also done, being intercepted in Thailand.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, I noted during my visit that both Thailand and the international community have assumed a disturbing attitude of submission to the junta. For example, many lawyers associations, opposition parties, refugees and political prisoners have alerted us to the terrible consequences that would befall the Burmese people if the international community and, in particular, the European Union were to support and endorse the sham elections that have been called by the SPDC for 2010. They warn us that this would give carte blanche to the junta to continue committing a wide range of crimes with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The political and ethnic groups that oppose the junta are very well organised and have drawn up an alternative constitution that is much more in line with the principles that we say we defend in the European Union. Therefore, for us to abandon them to their fate would be a mistake and would make us accomplices, whether active or passive, to the Burmese dictatorship.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the problem of human rights violations in Burma has been discussed several times during the current term of office of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Burma, a country known for its wonderful Buddhist temples which abound in gold, is also a prison for thousands of Burmese. They live in one of the biggest political regimes in the world, from which they try to escape – to the USA, Australia, Canada and to European countries and their neighbours. After adopting resolutions calling for the release of thousands of political prisoners, including many opposition leaders and with a Nobel Prize laureate foremost among them, and after protests from international organisations against the conscription of children in Burma, who are then forced to work and are denied proper care, today we are discussing the problem of human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During their flight from this Burmese hell, thousands of people – members of the Muslim minority – have been captured in their boats in Thai territorial waters, towed into international waters and left without navigational equipment or food supplies, and some have been imprisoned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in Burma. This includes incidents of denial of citizens’ rights, imprisonment, limited access to education, barriers to marriage, restrictions on free movement, and the destruction of mosques, churches and other places of worship. Although we should appreciate the permission granted by the Thai authorities for the temporary stay of refugees there, and also the declaration of the Prime Minister of Thailand in which he has announced an investigation, recent events are nevertheless an obvious example of the violation of human rights by the Thais.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of course we endorse the resolution which, however, does not alter the human tragedies in the region, where the background to the conflicts is not only the inhumane military regime and religious conflicts, but also the interests of various forces. It is therefore necessary to oppose more effectively both the military junta and the separatist tendencies of groups which persecute people who profess a different faith.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in recent years, thousands of Burmese have left their country for fear of repression by the ruling military regime and because of the spreading hunger, seeking refuge in Thailand or in neighbouring countries of South-East Asia. This problem mainly concerns the Rohingya ethnic minority, who live in the western part of the country. They are systematically denied citizenship, their freedom of speech and freedom of movement are limited, and they are denied other basic human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem of Burmese refugees has a regional dimension, and neighbouring countries, such as India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, must work more closely together to resolve the problem and to provide the refugees with suitable care and shelter. International agencies are reporting cases of the inhumane treatment of Burmese refugees and of their brutal deportation, which is synonymous with sentencing them to certain death. When the Thai Coastguard pushed out to open sea a boat with a thousand refugees but no food supplies on board, it was an inhumane act and led to the deaths of many of the refugees.</p>

Let us hope that these pledges will be fulfilled. On the other hand, it is not the first time we have discussed the brazen and inadmissible conduct of the Burmese regime.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Commission, as a matter of priority, is following the situation in Myanmar and Thailand, including the recent incidents where refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar were stranded in Thailand.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thailand hosts approximately 140 000 refugees in nine camps along the border. More than one million Myanmar citizens constitute an important part of the workforce in Thailand in the agricultural sector, in textiles and in the tourism sector. The Rohingya boat people trapped in Thailand are part of the multi-faceted, forced or voluntary emigration from Myanmar. Moreover, Thailand has other refugee issues to settle as well, such as the Hmong people from Laos.</p>
      <p sl="en">The complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive political, humanitarian, economic and social solution. The Commission is conducting an intensive debate with the international community and the Thai Government, in a search for possible solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent political uncertainties in Thailand interrupted the dialogue with the Government on this issue, but that is temporary. Thus, the Commission expects that the EU’s initiative vis-à-vis the Government will result in a constructive approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 29 January 2009, the EU Troika, at ambassador level in Bangkok, expressed its concerns to the Thai authorities. It welcomed the Thai Government’s intention to investigate the incidents fully, and to share its findings, and urged the Thai Government to treat boat people arriving in Thai waters according to international humanitarian and human rights standards.</p>

      <p sl="en">In conclusion, a sustainable solution cannot be the result of short-term security considerations, but must take into account long-term humanitarian, political and socio-economic concerns.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Antonio Santoro, prison officer, Lino Sabadin, butcher, Perluigi Torregiani, jeweller, and Andrea Campagna, state police officer: these are the names of four citizens who, together with many others, lost their lives between 6 June 1978 and 19 April 1979, killed by the insane homicide of terrorist organisations that attempted to overthrow the democratic order in Italy. And the name of one of the murderers is Cesare Battisti.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, I would like to echo the regret expressed by President Napolitano of Italy at the decision made by Mr Lula, the Brazilian president, to grant political refugee status to the Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti, who was sentenced by the courts to life imprisonment for committing those four murders, during the ‘Years of Lead’.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let me remind you that Battisti was found guilty not only by the Italian judiciary, but also by the French judiciary and by the European Court of Human Rights. This is an inexplicable and extremely serious act, which cannot and must not go unnoticed by the European institutions. We have a duty to the relatives of Battisti’s victims, but most importantly, we are also bound because the European Union has, for many years, determined an anti-terrorism strategy to guarantee citizens’ safety and to safeguard democratic institutions. To stand by and watch would thus be to thwart the efforts made over the years to fight side by side against an ever-present threat.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also hopes that Brazil will reconsider and think hard about what is a very delicate, but utterly rightful and legitimate request. Brazil is a great democratic country and has always enjoyed an excellent relationship with Europe and with Italy, which is precisely why we have been taken by surprise by this door slammed in our face. Indeed, for the sake of the friendship and respect that joins our countries, for the sake of the friendship and cooperation and partnership agreements linking Brazil and the European Union, whether politically or economically, the response of all parties must be decisive and effective.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe must unite behind the action of the Italian Government, which is using every legitimate form of political and diplomatic pressure and legal recourse so that justice may be done. The decision taken by Brazil conflicts appallingly with the image of the European Union, since it appears to presume that political persecution and torture is practised within one of its Member States. In short, we are dealing with an unacceptable situation which, above all, has no grounding in reality.</p>

He has also been found guilty by the Italian courts of other acts such as belonging to an armed group, possession of firearms – a serious crime in most European countries – and acts of violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">This man has been found guilty by an Italian court. Yet we find that on 17 December, the Brazilian Government, a democratic government, has granted him political refugee status.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Mr Mauro said, the European Union must express its solidarity with the Italian government and show Brazil, a friendly, democratic country, that a mistake has been made.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Brazilian authorities inform us that the matter is still awaiting an appeal before the federal supreme court, but it is lamentable that the case has proceeded in this manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">It must also be remembered that the European Court of Human Rights rejected Mr Battisti’s request for protection and that the European Union now bases its action on the respect of fundamental human rights, which is an essential component of the European Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, taking into consideration the bonds of friendship between the European Union and Brazil, the Brazilian authorities should be reminded that the EU is a good ally and friend and that we hope, in return, that they will not act in this manner, as has been the case in the past.</p>

We are now discussing an individual legal case that is currently being tried in court, in connection with which we have the gall to say that we will stand up for the principle of the rule of law. Where I come from, one of the most fundamental principles of the rule of law is that a parliament does not interfere in individual court cases.</p>

      <p sl="sv">If we are not happy with how Brazil and Europe are handling extraditions and if we are not happy with how our laws are interpreted in national courts, we should change the laws so that they are the same for everyone. We should not barge in and try to influence an individual case. That is the job of the judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers, not of Parliament.

I wonder whether the same thing would have happened if it had been perhaps a German terrorist from the Red Army Faction? Europe is, however, saying to Brazil that to fail to extradite a common criminal and communist like Battisti, who today even in prison dares to mock his victims, would be to downgrade itself to a country of refuge for the worst criminals and terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="it">Such behaviour would call into question all partnership agreements and, I believe, participation in the G8.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I asked to speak because I was Chairman of the German-Brazilian Parliamentarian Group in the lower house of the German Parliament for 10 years and I know Brazil very well. I am indeed surprised at the refusal of the Lula administration to extradite this convicted murderer to a European Member State. I hope that the proceedings in Brazil will be concluded very quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Lula administration has made a particular commitment to human rights. One aspect of human rights is that convicted murderers be brought to justice, and so I hope that this motion for a resolution receives strong support. I personally shall make use of my contacts with Brazilian parliamentarians to see to it that pressure is put on the government at domestic level, too, to grant this extradition request.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, after the end of the Second World War in Europe, many Nazi criminals fled to South America to escape from justice. Attempts to bring them back and to bring them to court have been extremely difficult. This led to such desperate steps as the actions of Israeli operatives who simply kidnapped Eichmann from South America so that he could be brought to court.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is evident that the tradition of escapes to South America is not dying out, neither is the conviction that refuge can be found there and that it will be possible to live out one’s days peacefully and with impunity despite the crimes which have been committed. Actions of this kind, like those of the Brazilian Government, maintain such a conviction and may, unfortunately, cause the feeling of impunity to spread greatly. Therefore, it is extremely important that this motion for extradition be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission is aware of the Brazilian Justice Minister’s recent decision to grant political asylum to an Italian citizen, Cesare Battisti, condemned in absentia to a life sentence by the Italian judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have carefully considered the Commission’s role in this situation, especially after Italy’s European Affairs Minister, Andrea Ronchi, called on Vice-President Barrot last week for the EU to support Italy’s extradition request to the Brazilian Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">As was also explained to the Italian Government, there is no scope for an involvement of the Commission in this case. The EU Treaty is very clear on this matter: the European Union’s and Commission’s legal powers in the field of cooperation in criminal matters are restricted to the legal space of the EU-27. The European Union can facilitate extradition between Member States, but has no competences regarding Member States’ relations with third countries on criminal cooperation matters. Italy’s bilateral relations with Brazil on this matter are governed by a bilateral agreement signed in 1989.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, you are going to think me bad-tempered, but I feel that such important reports, such important resolutions voted on by so few Members – and it is not those who are here, of course, who are to blame – frankly, I find the situation hopeless and, really, I do question our credibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, personally speaking, I will not be able to accept there being so few of us for much longer, and, at some point, the question will have to be asked as to whether there should be a quorum. I am well aware that there have to be 40 Members before a quorum may be requested. Since there are just over 40 of us, this is difficult, but I still think that something will have to be done.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am asking for a last-minute change to the wording of the oral amendment – if the House will allow – because we have now managed to establish what the confusion was in the joint resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The wording originally said ‘non-fire period’, and that did not make any sense to us, so we changed it to ‘cease-fire’. It now transpires that the official text from the Declaration of the Co-Chairs, which includes the European Union, uses the wording – which is strange, but nevertheless they use it in writing – ‘no-fire’ period. So, could we change the ‘non-fire’ to ‘no-fire’ rather than the word ‘cease-fire’, as this would reflect the official text of the Co-Chairs?</p>

I do apologise, but I have things down in the wrong order on my list. I was actually reading out the change I wanted to make to recital K, rather than to paragraph 2, so that is the one we will be voting on next. I do apologise for the confusion.</p>
