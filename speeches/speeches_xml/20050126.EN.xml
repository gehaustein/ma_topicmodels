      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission today took one of its most important decisions: it adopted the political framework for action, which it intends to follow during its five-year mandate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is why I am here today to present to you a strategy for European action. The starting point for this strategy is to meet the expectations and needs of Europe’s citizens and its aim is to ensure that by 2010 Europe will be well on the way towards renewal. I should like to propose to you that Parliament should also make this its strategy. The Constitution provides for a common action programme that must be agreed upon by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I suggest that we take our lead from this provision straightaway, and propose to Parliament and the Council that the strategic objectives for the Union adopted by the Commission today act as a basis for joint action in the next five years. This is a partnership for a renewed Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Why does the Union need a partnership? Enlargement has demonstrated that Europe is a success, but the truth of the matter is that many citizens still appear to have doubts. Together we must strengthen our legitimacy; together we must send out a stronger message; together we must show our political determination to strive to achieve common goals.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the President of the Commission for setting out, to both our institutions, the EU’s strategic objectives for the coming years. I feel that the President of the Commission was wise to confine himself to the substance, and not to go into too much detail on the legislation that must be put in place or the initiatives that must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am delighted to see that the opinions of the Commission and the Presidency broadly coincide and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the programmes of the Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies, and of those that follow in 2006, are in fact very close to the Commission President’s proposals. I feel that this is a partnership for European renewal on which there should not be any interinstitutional conflict. The people watching us – the citizens of Europe – are not interested in the opinions and the actions of the Commission, the Council and Parliament. For Europeans, Europe is one entity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note that there have been differing reactions to my proposals, and that some of those reactions have given me more pleasure than others!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Given the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Council, I would suggest that we look into ways of showing the outside world that the three institutions are indeed in broad agreement, and, even if the new Constitution is not yet in force, we shall certainly find ways and means of raising awareness of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like to inform you that the chairman of the General Affairs Council, Mr Asselborn, will ensure that the speech by the President of the Commission and the programme that he has drawn up will feature on the agenda at the General Affairs Council of 31 January. Together with the other two institutions, we shall try to find a way to express this shared desire.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the European Council, ladies and gentlemen, the presence of the President of the European Council in this chamber today – for the first time in the history of the European Union – is splendidly symbolic, and augurs well for the success of the Commission’s work in the coming five years.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a fine symbol: here we are today, the President of the Commission, the President of the European Council and the Members of this European Parliament, taking counsel together on the future of our European continent and setting out on the road together, for we know that European integration is the greatest labour of peace of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and it is one for which we want to work.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is our values, our ideals and our convictions that guide us in what we do. We have faith in our European continent; we believe that it has a future in which we and our children can share. Faith alone, though, is not enough; our common task is to make that faith real through our actions. Our values, which underpin what we do, are the dignity of man, the rule of law, democracy, and an order which, while founded upon the market economy, is also social.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have confidence in people, in their abilities, and in their drive. Neither state nor public intervention can be fundamental; it is the initiative of each individual, the realisation of their own potential in a society characterised by both freedom and solidarity, that is our model for the future of this continent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President of the Commission, you have chosen a fine motto for your programme – a partnership within and without, and prosperity, solidarity and security to renew Europe. Your programme is both realistic and ambitious, and we are glad that, rather than again having recourse to the overblown language of Lisbon in March 2000, when the talk was of how Europe was going to become the most competitive economic location in the world, you talk of it becoming ‘more competitive’. You are modest in the language you use, but ambitious in the goal you set, and I see that as the right formula for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future of the European social model is dependent on the European Union’s ability to compete in the world, and those who fail to promote the European Union’s competitiveness now will bear the blame if, in the future, we are unable to guarantee a European social model. The European Union’s competitiveness and the European social model are two sides of the same coin, and we are also facing the enormous challenge posed by changes in population. Another great political task for Europe and the countries in it will be to establish the conditions for a proper family policy, for children’s future. Without children, this continent has no future, and that is why we have to treat this as such a major issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also, if we become more competitive, this does not end up benefiting businesses in some abstract way; in very practical ways, it benefits workers, for it is not just about retaining jobs, but also about using our increasing competitiveness as a means to create more of them. That is why there is no contradiction between competition on the one hand and social policy on the other.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Almunia’s presence here reminds me that the President of the European Council also, at the same time, presides over an important group of finance ministers. Our group is committed to keeping Europe’s currency stable, and nothing of what we have hitherto heard from Mr Juncker gives us cause for concern. What is crucial, though, is that the assessment of financial policy – and that includes the financial policies of the Member States – should remain the Commission’s responsibility and that the decision as to whether to go back to running a deficit should not be left to the Member States alone; the Commission has an important part to play in it. If you follow the example of your predecessor Pedro Solbes, Mr Almunia, you will always have support from us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Internal and external security – that too was something you mentioned, Mr President of the Commission. People expect our borders to be secure: we have 11 000 kilometres of them on land, and 68 000 kilometres at sea, and we have to secure them, but they must not become impenetrable. We cannot, in future, have even more people from the states on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa trying to escape the misery of their home countries and dying at sea in the attempt; this is where we have to make a joint effort, together with our neighbours in North Africa, to find a good and humane solution to the refugee problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same is true, but in another way, of our Eastern neighbours. Tomorrow, Viktor Yushchenko, the newly-elected President of Ukraine, will be here with us. Whilst it would not be true to say that all countries with policies along European lines are capable of joining the European Union right away, what is crucial is that we develop a policy of being a good neighbour.</p>
      <p sl="de">By way of conclusion, I would like to say that in matters of security, armed force can never be more than the means of last resort. Our task as Europeans is to put together a policy of preventive security. I urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to make every effort to bring peace to the Middle East, enabling Israel to live in peace and the Palestinians to retain their dignity.</p>
      <p sl="de">If it is in this way that we go into the future of the European Union, and if the Financial Perspective does nothing to infringe Parliament’s rights, then we will be right alongside you, Mr President of the Commission. We have confidence in you, and, for the sake of our European continent, we wish you great success.</p>

    <intervention id="3-017" speaker_id="1911" name="Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Mr Barroso has put before us a glass, and it is for us to decide how full it is. That such a President of the Commission as Mr Barroso has not presented us with a glass brimming over with red wine is something we expected. Now, though, we have to ask ourselves whether the glass is half full or half empty. We have come to the conclusion that it is half full.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some of the proposals you have put before us are good; some of them are what we Social Democrats expected from a Commission such as yours. There are also things that you omitted, and that we would have liked to hear from you, but I do not want to hold that against you. Much of what we have heard today we can see as reflecting what we Social Democrats think.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, I want to thank you for having worked with the Social Democrats among your Commissioners, and it is evident even from the title of your strategic programme that you discussed its publication with Commissioner Wallström. That is apparent both from the title and the contents, which reflects points that we Social Democrats have made, and that, Mr President, is a good thing. We would encourage you to carry on down that road.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard you say that you want your work over the next five years to focus on prosperity, solidarity and security. You have proved yourself to be a good listener. You were right to say that solidarity, prosperity and security are interdependent. Now, within the European framework, each has his responsibility: you, the President of the Council, and this Parliament as a whole. All of us have our institutional roles. This Parliament, though, is home to political families, and the political family that I represent has no institutional role to play, but rather a political task to perform. That political task involves me telling Mr Poettering that he is right to say that enhanced competitiveness and social policy are two sides of the same coin, but that we want both sides of this coin to be stamped with the same value. We are right behind those who want more competition in Europe if they want it to benefit social cohesion. Growth has to be created in order that social cohesion be secured; if that is your watchword, Mr President, then the Socialists are on your side. If, though, that does not happen and the approach involves using deregulation as a means of dismantling the socially responsible practices for which we Socialists have campaigned for over 150 years, then we will not support it.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I want to add that we are hearing a good message today. The programme you have put before us is a good one, one on the basis of which we can work together with you. The litmus test, though, will be the lawmaking process. When you take your initiatives and the Council and this House must take joint decisions, we will have to make compromises, and we will then all have to be judged by how much of what had been announced is actually produced. So let me repeat that, while we are prepared to cooperate in a constructive way, we do have our very clearly-defined expectations where the maintenance of social standards in Europe is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two things I want to say to you on behalf of the Socialist Group, two things that were new to us today and that we were glad to hear. We have been critical of you – not so much in your present role, which has to do with positions on international policy, as in your former role as Prime Minister of Portugal. For you to say, as you did today, that your Commission wants efficient multilateralism, is something we regard as progress. As Mr Poettering pointed out, we want Europe to be a global political player, but also a civilian power. We do not want to solve international problems with pre-emptive strikes, and I have to say that the re-elected American President’s inauguration speech gave me the impression that the European Union must redouble its efforts at ensuring that civilian rather than military solutions are applied. Let us not add another disaster to the one already playing out in Iraq.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">If you, as one of the representatives of an organisation that carries weight in international politics, say: ‘I want efficient multilateralism’, then we will support you in that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to the Stability Pact, we share Mr Poettering’s view that it must be secured, and believe that its criteria should not be changed, but it must be manageable and usable, addressing the demands of 2005 rather than those of 1990. Fifteen years of development separate those two dates. A Stability Pact that is often interpreted in such a way that it produces the precise opposite of the growth to which its second part refers; a Pact that is so stable that it inhibits growth: such a pact is internally self-contradictory. That is why we want to see it reformed, and that is why we endorse the good proposals from Mr Almunia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by saying something fundamental about our future cooperation. This House gained in strength through the whole process of confirming the Commission in office, and it is good that you want to accommodate its wishes and work together with it as a whole. The presence here today of the President of the Council is an outstanding symbol of the truth that, when these institutions work together, security, prosperity, flexibility – and, where necessary, social security – can work. It is in cooperation that we find strength. ‘L'union fait la force’ is a fine saying. We are willing to unite if we are treated with respect and our political demands taken seriously. Remember, Mr President, that this is a day of agreement, and enjoy it, for the days of trial are yet to come.</p>

    <intervention id="3-018" speaker_id="2155" name="Watson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, as Jean Monnet once said ‘each man begins the world afresh and only institutions grow wiser’. President Barroso, you now represent the collective experience of the European Commission. You will have to draw quickly on the collective wisdom of its services and enrich the European experience, in tandem with the European Parliament as a partner in Europe’s growth and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, I believe your priorities reflect those of the majority of this House, which believes that we cannot build a house on unstable foundations. If we want a prosperous Europe, a Europe of sustainable development, a Europe that can fight poverty at home and abroad and a Europe able to project its values around the globe, then we must begin by securing a strong and viable economy where businesses and innovation can flourish. If Europe is to have meaning for its citizens, then we have to establish practical and tangible priorities. There is a danger, as we have witnessed with the Lisbon Agenda, that in attempting to do too many things in too many fields we achieve little of substance and leave the European people unable to see the wood for the trees.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are right to underpin your objectives with a push for better communication and better information. This should have been done a long time ago. We have allowed the persistent drip of half-truths and myths propagated by nationalists to poison the minds of too many of our fellow citizens. This year of referendums on the Constitution must be a rallying cry to all those who believe in the European project, for this is not about ratifying a text that people have not read, it is about whether Europe’s citizens still believe strongly enough in what the European Union stands for.</p>
      <p sl="de">You outline four objectives. First, prosperity. The Lisbon Agenda holds the key to your success, and if you can deliver prosperity and growth through improved competitiveness and knowledge-sharing then we can all partake of the dividends. Liberals and Democrats hope to see improvements to and a more intelligent application of the Stability and Growth Pact that underpins the euro. Ultimately, however, our growth and prosperity also depends on implementation at national level of the key structural reforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Second, you talked about solidarity – the flip side of the coin. Without that we have no Europe. A prosperous economy is a means to an end, but not an end in itself. European history is anchored in its commitment to solidarity and cohesion, to judicious management of natural resources and respect for common values and cultural diversity. We have to improve both the effectiveness and the accountability of our Structural Funds. Since there are good reasons why we cannot afford to be parsimonious in our future budgetary planning, Liberals and Democrats will fully support a costed and justified budget for the Union for the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Security is a matter of common concern, with the tentacles of international terrorism having made themselves felt from Manhattan to Madrid. If we do not find an adequate response to such threats, then the pillars of freedom on which our Union rests will begin to crumble. However, we must not go overboard in attempting to deal with security threats that are often intangible. We need a much wider debate on the balance between security and civic freedoms and I welcome the Commission’s proposals on immigration and asylum, which will be instrumental in steering a discussion based on justice and honesty, rather than pandering to fear and scaremongering.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, let us have ambitions for the wider world that are based not on imposition by military force but on the projection of soft force – of political dialogue, exchange, economic incentives and sanctions, humanitarian relief and trade agreements. You must deploy all of those tools in a coherent strategy that rewards good governance, punishes tyranny and shows care for the global environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Barroso, your task is not an easy one. The hopes and futures of Europe’s citizens rest in your hands. I shall end with another quotation from Jean Monnet, who stated in his memoirs that ‘a great statesman is one who can work for long-term goals which eventually suit situations as yet unforeseen’.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Barroso, you have set us long-term goals and we trust you will earn the reputation of a great statesman in delivering them.</p>

    <intervention id="3-019" speaker_id="4255" name="Jonckheer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, because of the Treaties, the Commission enjoys a twofold political privilege: the privilege of time – it is effectively free of electoral constraints for five years – and the privilege of initiative in the general interest of the Union, as stated in the draft Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is very difficult, Mr President of the Commission, not to agree with the proposals that you have put forward. I therefore feel that, as things stand, our Group can recommend that you put your plans into action. I should also like to return – and I allude here to a motion for a resolution that we tabled in December jointly with the other political groups – to four or five points relating to political elections, which strike me as significant and which are all in fact already being discussed in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first of these is the EU’s budget, to which you alluded. The European Greens feel that the Prodi Commission’s proposal on the Union’s budget ceiling is an absolute minimum, and in fact too low. We therefore support your proposal, Mr Barroso, just as we support the intention to redirect Union expenditure; for example, European funding is to be set up for Natura 2000; in the field of research, funding earmarked for nuclear energy is to be redirected towards renewable energy or towards the Commission’s programme on intelligent energy, a further means of reducing the risks to the public; and European funding for culture and education is to be increased, so that more students and creators can help raise awareness of what is happening in Europe. We certainly support the Commission in its responsibility, which consists of reminding the Council and the Heads of State or Government that, indeed, as you have said, it is not possible for a European Union of 25 Member States and 450 million inhabitants to succeed on the budgets that some governments wish to set aside for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns the REACH legislation, which is genuinely intended to protect human health, while fostering technological innovation in the chemical industry. We hope that the Commission will maintain its proposal so that Parliament can deliver its opinion at first reading and that we do not postpone the entire package once again. Furthermore, the Greens would also like to enrich this proposal with other considerations, such as the obligation to replace very dangerous substances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third point relates to the proposed law on the internal services market. As things stand, this will lead to increased competition between economies, without sufficiently regulating the conditions of that competition, thereby paving the way for social dumping in the Union. The country of origin principle cannot be retained as a guiding principle in this proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the assessment of Union policy, the Luxembourg Presidency was right, in its Presidency text, to state that assessment of all Union policy regarding the criteria of sustainable development must not be deemed of secondary importance and must not therefore be pushed aside by the Lisbon Strategy. In this regard, we look forward to the Commission’s report on the consistency of policies, such as transport policy or energy policy in respect of the EU’s international commitments within the framework of the climate convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that the Union must continue to play a leading role in international climate negotiations and must immediately undertake to achieve objectives set for 2020 – we are already looking much further ahead – objectives that entail much greater energy-saving efforts than those we are currently making.</p>
      <a text="(Applause from the left)"/>

    <intervention id="3-020" speaker_id="1018" name="Wurtz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it has taken the EU a long time to acknowledge that the Lisbon Strategy has failed to meet the objectives set in 2000. I had the opportunity to mention in this very House a Commission report from last January, which pointed out that, on the road to full employment, during the year just finished, for the first time in ten years, we actually shed more jobs than we created. As for building a knowledge-based economy, the same report noted that there had in fact been an ‘overall decline’ in public and private investment in the fields that are key to the future, namely training, education and research. The report also said that more than one 15 year-old in six did not have, and I quote, ‘the minimum skills required, of reading, writing and arithmetic’. This was a shocking, but telling, detail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Accordingly, the remedies announced since then, to go faster and further down the neoliberal road, strike us as deeply flawed and extremely dangerous. The key word here is competitiveness. What concept of competitiveness are we talking about? The one prevailing in the Union is based on cutting wages, making labour markets less secure and extending working lives. It generates competition in the social, tax and salary areas between the 25 Member States. It sees the democratic elements of the work code as an obstacle. It drives down public spending and places restrictive limits on the framework of services of general economic interest. Even health and environmental requirements – as has just been said – run the risk of being revised downwards in the name of competitiveness, as in the case of the REACH programme. Cultural exception in the rules of competitiveness is put in jeopardy for the same reason. This is undoubtedly what Mr Barroso was thinking about when he mentioned the ‘friendly business environment’ in the report that he gave us. I am convinced that this neoliberal mindset, this culture of the lowest bidder, runs counter to the stated objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It thwarts those objectives, first of all, because budgetary and salary austerity contributes towards stagnation in consumption – that crucial engine of growth – and works against jobs; secondly, because this restrictive policy inevitably leads to additional expenditure for men and women, beginning with training, a need that is increasingly crucial; and thirdly because this obsession with the market and the unbridled monetarisation of the economy and of competition, is destroying people’s motivation, creativity and confidence in the future, which is an essential, not to say indispensable, resource in the smooth running of the economy and society. Mr Barroso, you said, yourself, in your communication, that a significant proportion of European public opinion remains to be convinced that Europe is on the right track; that, I believe, is an understatement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What can be done about this? Among the immediate measures to be taken, as far as we are concerned, is to exclude spending on research, education and health expenditure, spending on certain infrastructures and job-related spending from the assessment of public-sector deficits that are to be brought under control. We must also bring in democratic monitoring of all public funding awarded to companies to check its effectiveness from the point of view of employment, and if that system is shown to be ineffective, money must be paid back.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, as Parliament has specifically requested, we feel that an assessment must be made of the effects of liberalisation, such as that of the railways, before moving on to the next stage, and we naturally reiterate our request that the Bolkestein directive be withdrawn. On the subject of that directive, Mr President, I see that it is no longer mentioned in the Commission’s text, unless I am mistaken. I should like to believe that this implies that you have accepted the request for it to be withdrawn, though what we would really like, in view of what is at stake, is for the President of the Commission to confirm this change himself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In short, structural changes must, in our view, be put in place that ultimately lead to shared control of the markets and, accordingly, to a return to the primacy of political choice, such as the choice to prioritise job security or training for every individual preparing for a job. To do this, we also need resources, which raises the question of the remit and the status of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso has just highlighted the need to be tuned into the citizens’ concerns. I feel that many of the concerns that I have mentioned are shared far beyond the circles close to my group. The Commission would be well advised not to ignore them.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you now have five years in which to make Europe into the world’s most competitive economy. In the EU, we have the wrong approach to regulation. We send officials to Brussels to set prices for products for which there is no lack of suppliers and for which there is plenty of demand. So much for the market economy. In that way, we overcharge, levy taxes and duties and prevent developing countries from selling food to us, and then hand the money out again, as subsidies tailored to the owners’ assets. A landowner with a thousand hectares receives hundreds of times more in subsidies than a farmer with ten hectares. There is no ceiling on subsidies; 20% of farmers take 80% of the subsidies. The farmers’ income is only a fraction of the subsidies for the common agricultural policy. We thus discriminate against the new Member States. We have also created a subsidy industry and an army of lobbyists who travel to Brussels to get some of our own money back again.</p>
      <p sl="da">Now, the Commission wants more money for more plans, and the opportunity to levy new taxes itself. My advice is to try having less money, less tax, fewer subsidies and greater freedom for the Member States, and reimburse those who cannot cope successfully in the market place.</p>
      <p sl="da">There must also be some natural energy and raw materials left for our descendants. It must be possible to be a pioneering country in environmental terms. We must give the poorest countries the opportunity to increase their demand by allowing them to pay less in EU subscriptions and by giving Structural Fund resources to the poorest areas in the poorest countries. Millions of citizens receive no wages because the labour market is not available to them. We have a Central Bank that gives more consideration to the price of money than to families. The EU has a common currency and a shared reticence about investment. Why not, rather, agree an across-the-board boost to investment whereby countries with balance of payments deficits increase investment by 5%, those with surpluses increase it by 7% and those with neither deficits nor surpluses increase it by 6%. In that way, everyone would sell more and obtain increased employment without anyone’s being given a black mark for their balance of payments. Economic coordination can provide much more growth and employment than the artificial jobs created through bureaucratic incentives.</p>
      <p sl="da">Being new, you do not need, Mr Barroso, to get caught up in the mountain of detailed regulation in Brussels. Instead, you should give freedom full rein.</p>

To that extent I would like to pay tribute to President Barroso for having the courage, politically as well as administratively, to come forward with what is truly a vision for where Europe should be in the next five to ten years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly welcome the fact that he has moved away from the old convention that the Commission was above politics, because he is talking about a Commission that will be more politically focused, that will respond more to the needs of the people and the citizens within the European Union, and that can give leadership to those people within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rather than go back over everything that has been said by my colleagues, I would like to make three very brief points. If we want to play our part on the world stage we must first get things right within our own Union. We must ensure that there is a certainty of ideology, a certainty of programming and a certainty of strength within our own Union before we can spread that message further abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, ultimately the only thing that succeeds in any political forum or any political life is when people on the ground feel their lives are improving because of the decisions that are being taken. When we speak about solidarity in this room, we very rarely mention the solidarity of ensuring that there is equality of opportunity, equality of investment, equality of education and equality of training for each and every one of our citizens. In every area where there has been growth in economic terms or in terms of social development, those have been the key elements for driving that force.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last point I would like to make is this: never forget our responsibility to Africa. Today, millions of people are dying because of conflict, millions are dying because of starvation and millions more will die over the next number of years because of AIDS. We must be the global leader as regards finding solutions for the problems in Africa. We must live up to our goals and our responsibilities in that sense.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the beginning of a football tournament, anyone can hope to be the champion – even those who had difficulty qualifying in the first place – and that is certainly true in politics too. While I hope that your programme gets you to the top of the league, I would like – in the short speaking time available to me – to share two ideas with you.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I would like is for you, before bringing an actual proposal or directive to this House or presenting it to the public, to keep it back for a very short space of time and ask yourself: ‘Does it comply with the principle of economy?’ or ‘Might it not be possible to be less ambitious when it comes to administration, not to mention the Financial Perspective?’ Consideration of the political background leads me to say that there are times when EUR 700 billion over seven years can amount to more that EUR 1 billion for the same period.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second thought follows on from that. I would ask you to take care that you do not fall into a trap by yielding to the temptation to free up funds for rearmament. That way, you may be able to create jobs in the short term, but it would be disastrous for Europe as a peace project.</p>

    <intervention id="3-024" speaker_id="2025" name="Grossetête" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should firstly like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council how much we appreciate his presence, because it must be admitted that, in the past, the Council Presidency has, let us say, rarely appeared for important debates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President of the Commission, I should like to say to you that I find it particularly pertinent and interesting that Parliament is involved in the discussion on the multiannual programme, and, above all, in adopting it. This is new and significant; the multiannual programme will effectively be agreed upon by the Commission, the Council and Parliament. We shall also be discussing the Commission’s legislative and work programme. We would have liked to have been able to speak about this in more detail, but it is impossible because we have not had the time to study in any depth the proposals tabled by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Accordingly, I should hope that as politicians we can take part fully in these discussions and, most importantly, in decision-making; in other words, I should hope that it is not left to our staff and your staff to make decisions on the multiannual programme. That is not something we would wish to see. What we want, as politicians, is to decide, and in so doing become codeciders of this programme. Parliament must therefore be allowed to work with you in the best possible conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Undoubtedly, 2005 will be a crucial year for our institutions. I should like to speak about the Constitution and its ratification. We must channel all our efforts into competitiveness and thus jobs, because poverty is unacceptable in Europe. Let us put an end to the interminable, and, unfortunately sometimes, pitiful, rhetoric, and let us put the Lisbon Strategy properly into practice. On this matter, I should like, if I may, to focus on one particular point. I am shocked to see that some people are still opposed to competitiveness and the environment, with the implication that we have learned nothing about sustainable development, despite the tragedy in Asia on 26 December and despite the fact that the scientists keep sounding the alarm as regards the drastic developments in terms of climate change and its consequences. We must understand that bringing the environment into the equation is a competitive advantage; this is the way to develop new and innovative technologies that lead, in turn, to new jobs. Competitiveness, environment and solidarity are the new European pillars.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore keeping a watchful eye on both the REACH directive and the services directive, given that job creation should not lead to other jobs being lost. After all, our priority should be the health of our companies and at the same time the health of our people – everything is connected. Your programme is an ambitious one, Mr President of the Commission. We support you now and shall continue to support you as regards the financial perspectives, because it is important that Europe’s budget is capable of financing the priorities and the policies that we would like to implement together.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-025" speaker_id="2295" name="Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, as Mr Schulz has already said, many passages in the programme you have presented reflect our thinking, and this is something I want to highlight. It is, however, in the nature of parliamentarians never to be satisfied with what they are given, and so I would like to concentrate on those points where I would ask you to take matters further.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your starting point was the issue of better regulation, in other words, our need for a different way of making laws, and you also asked whether the public understand what we want. I do think that we need to concentrate, over the coming months and years, on those issues in which the public are really interested, such as that of public services, and that is where there is a lack of commitment on the part of the Commission, most particularly, in practical terms, when it comes to a framework directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the public see one post office after another closing down, more and more other public facilities disappearing, and whole swathes of land laid waste, they ask themselves whether Europe is the underlying cause of it, and so I ask you not only to focus on the issue of private services, but also to give higher priority to services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, your programme begins with prosperity, and then moves on to solidarity. You repeatedly stress that the two are connected, and you are right to do so. There too, I ask you to go even further. In the European model of society, in fact, it is impossible to separate the promotion of our prosperity from solidarity, and we do not see solidarity as a hindrance to efficiency, a hindrance to competitiveness, or even – as the Nordic model demonstrates – as a hindrance to flexibility on the labour market. If we want a flexible labour market, it is all the more important that social networks should be in place to catch people if the worst comes to the worst.</p>
      <p sl="de">What solidarity also means for us, though, is that the public sector must not be starved or neglected. Growth, employment, and the fair distribution of income demand not an over-expanded public sector, but one that is alive and proportionate. We need – as you rightly said – more investment in infrastructure; we need, above all, more investment in health and education, and that brings me back to services, for it is a vitally important point that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want to extend public services. On the subject of private service, though, I would like to pick up on something that Mr Juncker said: while we want the market for services to be opened up, we do not want social dumping. It is for that reason that the Services Directive is in need of revision.</p>
      <p sl="de">Solidarity conjoined with prosperity does of course also mean the practice of solidarity with all groups in society, including various minorities – about which this House is now doing something – and especially the large Roma and Sinti minorities. I think this an appropriate opportunity to make that clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Solidarity also, of course, means international solidarity on our part, and that brings me to my last point, that Europe is a great civil power. We may be a soft power, but soft power does not mean weak power, the two are not the same thing, and that is something I think we have to stress. If we, as the Americans now acknowledge, were so successful in Ukraine and have to continue with a rational approach, doing what has to be done in the right order, and if we are heading for success in the Balkans, then we must apply the same approach to the shaping of international policy in such places as Iran. We also have to tell our American friends – and I emphasise ‘friends’ – in plain terms that it is not acceptable to take military action first; on the contrary, we have to try, wherever possible, to apply civilian solutions through negotiation and participation; that is the European way of doing things.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not in any way disregarding the fact that there are military elements in this. We may well be a great civil power, but the military element is needed if the great civil power of Europe is to be credible and capable of making itself felt.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, you have come some way; we Social Democrats would like us to go even further. The fact that the USA, China and Russia have a quite different view of the world means that we increasingly have to communicate Europe’s own, even to our own citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="3-026" speaker_id="28384" name="Geremek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">I should like to say that I am very much in favour of the planned ‘partnership for a renewed Europe’. I am not entirely sure what the word ‘partnership’ means in this context, but I am quite sure what ‘a renewed Europe’ means, and it is my belief that a defining feature of Europe has always been its ability to undergo constant reform and successive renaissances.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to draw Mr Barroso’s attention to two issues I believe to be important when talking of a renewed Europe. The first of these is education. Europe has traditionally gained its strength from its education system, which provides schooling from primary to university level, yet we must be aware that this education system is currently deteriorating. It is not enough simply to say that culture and education are important, Mr President. A strategy outlining the way in which education is to be placed at the heart of the European Union’s concerns is needed. It would then be impossible to use the principle of subsidiarity to claim that the European Union institutions have no right to take action. We need a strategy that ensures European education is the best in the world, because this is what it deserves and this is one of Europe’s great traditions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Democracy is another issue I believe to be important, and with regard to which I also expect there to be some kind of political strategy. It is simply not true to say that democracy is an inherent characteristic of Europe. By its very nature, democracy frequently comes under attack from the powerful. At present European democracy is being weakened by populism and instances of demagogy, and this means that there should be a European strategy on democracy, which would also serve as a mouthpiece for the whole world. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President of the Commission, your manifesto – I am sorry, but I find that it has an acute neo-liberal slant. The failure to get close to the Lisbon targets is being used as an argument to compress the social and regional cohesion and environmental protection pillars in the name of competitiveness. We are opposed to the approach taken by Mr Kok's committee, because it leads to less Europe, especially in the cohesion and environment sectors, and to more social dumping, which dismantles the European social state. We need ambitious, not miserly plans for the unified Europe of the future. A substantial increase in own resources is needed in order to finance the new common policies demanded by the citizens of the 25 Member States now and the 27 in future. The Commission proposal is the minimum starting point for the financial perspectives. If you want, you have a brilliant opportunity, you just have to stop constantly going backwards. Everyone needs to understand at long last that a bigger Europe, more Europe, with less money is impossible.</p>

      <p sl="en">To my surprise, Mr President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s speech. I particularly enjoyed the passage where he admitted to being short of money, although I fear this may be a first-time experience for some of the other members of the Commission. Mr Barroso, you also said the European Union will manage immigration and asylum policy. You said it is a European problem and therefore one best dealt with via a European approach. That was very helpful and will come as news to poor Michael Howard and the Conservatives in the British Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has to be said that your work programme has been shaped largely by the Commission’s annual policy strategy for 2005, which was published in February 2004 under the last Commission. It is Mr Prodi we should be questioning today about the Commission’s central policy objective of economic growth. He did not do very well, did he? What a travesty of democracy! We have the EU’s policies for 2005 dictated by a defunct Commission and approved by an expired Parliament. It is only the present Parliament that is sidelined.</p>
      <p sl="en">Do not worry, though, Mr Barroso, your luck is in: very few MEPs will even notice. The UK Independence Party, however, is very grateful to you because, as we are wont to say, ‘worse is better’!</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, looking beyond individual national problems, the Commission statement reveals a picture of overall difficulty for the European economic system. No state can reverse this downturn alone; it is the duty of the European institutions, in particular the Commission, to fire up the European economy by concentrating on a strategy aimed at employment, growth and inclusive development.</p>
      <p sl="it">Firstly, the Lisbon strategy needs to be relaunched, in a such a way that it finally becomes effective, and a national administrator should be appointed to meet its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, the Stability Pact needs to be revised intelligently, so as to encourage structural reforms and to facilitate pursuit of the Lisbon objectives, boosting investment in infrastructure and research to increase competitiveness. In this regard, I consider it essential to hold a debate in the European Parliament on the reform of the Stability Pact before the European Council in March.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, perhaps we need to return to the idea, originally put forward by Mr Delors, of financing European public investment to support growth and competitiveness by issuing Community bonds, which, now, would be guaranteed by the current strength of the euro.</p>

Has it never occurred to you, Mr Barroso, that you are a part of the problem and not a part of the solution? Why do you never ask yourselves whether all your interference and regulation is necessary? Can you not see the damage that your predecessors have done? Have you learnt nothing from it? Why do you presume to know better than those who use their initiative and enterprise to create wealth, investment and jobs?</p>

      <p sl="hu">On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express how pleased I was to see how quickly after its appointment the European Commission started working. The recent strategic material clearly shows that the Commission has not only begun its work, but has also paid attention to the European Parliament. I would like to remind the House and members of the Commission who are present that last December this House adopted a resolution which defined the fundamental strategic goals of the Commission, namely those goals that the European Parliament wanted to see in the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Commission has clearly taken these goals into account. We expressed our desire for a competitive and dynamic Europe, and the Commission is talking about competitiveness, prosperity and creating job opportunities. We expressed our desire to see cohesion, the consolidation of European expansion and solidarity, and the Commission is talking about the same issues. We wanted European citizens to have a safe Europe. These goals were clearly defined in the Commission’s recently published material, and in the President’s presentation as well. This is the case, even if Members of Parliament sometimes make the Commission’s work more difficult. Let me remind you that last December’s resolution was initially backed by most of the main groups in Parliament, but our socialist colleagues reneged on their approval at the last minute. Now, however, socialists issued strident press statements before the Commission and Parliament sittings regarding their expectations of the Commission. Interestingly enough, these expectations included elements that they refused to sign or vote for at the last sitting in Strasbourg. This is why I am content to see the socialists approve of this material even though they would like to see these issues become a little redder.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would, however, like to draw the attention of the Socialist representatives, indeed of all representatives from all Groups, to the fact that creating job opportunities is not a socialist or liberal goal; it is not the goal of the Green Party or the People’s Party, but is in the interests of European citizens. This is what we are working for, this is what we are fighting for. It is perhaps hardly surprising that I, as a representative from a new Member State, am bringing to your attention that one of the important aspects of solidarity within the European Union is to work with increased effort to create cohesion between existing and new Member States. I am confident that Mr Barroso, former Prime Minister of Portugal, a country that has enjoyed the benefits of cohesion for a long time, finds solidarity important even outside the context of generations and social strata. Finally, I would like to express our appreciation that the President of Commission undertook definite and clear commitments that the Commission will avoid steps that conflict with the interests of European citizens and that it will refrain from legislation that interferes with the goals of competitiveness and creating jobs opportunities, or infringes the security of European citizens. I wish the Commission courage to be able to refrain from action from time to time.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Some people might expect to see a good fight here today in this Chamber. It will not happen. It will not happen because the President has presented us with a document and with his comments that indicate a step ahead from the Strasbourg Document: we use the same words and hope that behind words of the same tenor, there is hope for similar and joint political action as well. I rest assured that his cooperation with the Vice-Presidents presages a promising future and I do not want to start a debate on who likes red in neck-ties and who prefers red in ears. Let us conclude that solidarity and social cohesion are values and they have human content rather than colour.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to talk about the issues of security and justice. I was pleased to find that security and justice were mentioned among the fundamental principles, and not simply treated as regulatory technicalities. We all know that security cannot be taken for granted and that it means more than providing a peaceful life to citizens in the face of life-threatening perils. European security policy does not end with combating the threat of terrorism and finding effective ways to prevent and tackle bombings. We believe, and I would like to emphasise this notion: democracy is the real pledge of security. Only democracy protects people, and personal rights are guaranteed by democracy in the law-making process. It is democracy that prevents the introduction, in the name of security, of restrictions that conflict with the philosophy of our Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We do not want to live in a world – we have already done so – where our dreams are written in dossiers. And neither do we want to live in a world where people are discriminated against on the basis of gender, age, religion, or financial or family status. We do not want discrimination, as it exposes the weak to tangible dangers and it is the weak who become more and more exposed: women, the elderly and children. We do not want discrimination of ‘otherness’ and this is why we keep asking you whether we can take seriously the promise of your personal commitment to anti-discriminatory legislature and to taking definite legal steps to combat discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are dangers that reach far beyond security policy among the perils that threaten the quality of human life. While entrenched and irreversible poverty creates fault lines that divide continents, countries and regions within countries, solidarity and social cohesion not only strengthen competitiveness, but security as well. They prevent mass migration of the poor, and may prevent anti-poverty riots. Hence, we can say that although nature may turn against man, our joint policy may prevent man from turning against man. I hope we will be able to cooperate no matter which side of the horseshoe we sit on in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the EU is missing the Lisbon Strategy’s targets. If we carry on as we have been doing, we will not manage to make the EU the world’s most competitive knowledge-based society.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, though, we hear Mr Poettering telling the plenary that it was not meant like that, that we do not want to become the most competitive society, that we just want to be able to compete, but, as for being Number One – no, no, that was not what we meant. That, Mr Poettering, bespeaks an attitude according to which competition is something to be talked about rather than faced up to. Sportsmen, entrepreneurs, scientists – they all want to compete and get to the top. If it were you rather than Otto Rehhagel coaching the Greek football team, Mr Poettering, they would never have got to Lisbon. The Greeks won, and we want Europe to win too. We face up to competition. We face up to competition between one economic area and another, quite simply because we have no other option. In this competition, we still have a chance; we have to use it, and we have to use it now.</p>
      <p sl="de">That the Commission, in its strategy document, has not only acknowledged that, but also wants its policy to be guided by it, gives Europe an opportunity, one that we very much welcome, and on which we congratulate the Commissioners responsible, firstly Mr Barroso, but also Commissioner Verheugen and the other members of the College. It is, after all, clear that we have to focus on becoming more competitive. We must at last grasp what competitiveness is: an indispensable condition for more growth and hence also for the creation of more jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">That we do this is a matter of obligation – not merely politically, but also morally. Mass unemployment and long-term unemployment are fundamental evils in Europe, in my own country and in many other Member States. Unemployment causes poverty, and poverty is a breeding ground for social problems, problems with health, and problems affecting the environment. The best antidote to poverty is properly paid work; it brings prosperity, it gives people prospects and a sense of self-worth. Only a society possessing these characteristics can achieve ambitious social and environmental objectives. That these are connected is something your group, Mr Schulz, will have to get into their heads. Mass unemployment is not a social benefit.</p>
      <p sl="de">With five wasted years behind us, now is the time to get started on implementing the Lisbon targets. The Commission has reached out a hand in partnership; we should, for our people’s sake, seize it. I might add that I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this afternoon, Parliament will be discussing the Commission’s plans for 2005, and so I should first of all like to consider the relationship between the Commission and Parliament. Mr Barroso’s yielding to pressure from Parliament in the autumn of 2004 evoked the image of a powerful Parliament against a powerless Commission. I should like to ask Mr Barroso whether that is an image with which he can identify.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In 2005, the Commission is facing the thankless task of keeping the referenda on the Constitution on the right track, but it has only itself to blame for having got itself into this predicament. Although the Commission is always claiming that ratification is, above all, a task for the nation state, and rightly so, this clear line has, unfortunately, been abandoned. By launching an active campaign and releasing funds, the Commission has lost its neutral stance. The public’s own tax money is now being used to fund the imposition on it of a constitution for which it never asked in the first place. The European Constitution campaign is meant to bring the citizen closer to Europe, but, if we jump the gun, it remains to be seen whether the public will feel they are being taken seriously. For example, a great deal of work is already being done behind the scenes with regard to the form the European external service should take. National parliaments and citizens, however, have not been consulted, precisely at a time when Commissioner Wallström indicated that Europe should start listening to its citizens now instead of pursuing a policy of faits accomplis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. Mr Barroso, you used a very striking phrase, namely that we must map out how we intend to turn dreams into reality. Unfortunately, we were not told which instruments you intend to use for this purpose. You said that legislation should be made simpler, yet we still do not know how you will reduce the ever-growing mountains of paper, because you gave us no clue as to how this will be done. You talked about prosperity and new jobs, yet establishing an overprotective welfare state will not bring about either of these things, and in the meantime the Lisbon strategy is fading out of sight. You talked about solidarity, yet how can we sit here and talk about solidarity when Australia, New Zealand and the United States have rushed to provide aid after the disaster in Asia, and the European Union has so far done nothing?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Barroso, if we wish to turn dreams into reality we must make it known which instruments we intend to use.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President of the European Commission, you are planning to present the European Constitution to the citizens of the European Union in a comprehensible manner. I should therefore like to ask the Commission also to include in this strategy a precise definition of the concept of Europeanism. The Constitution states that Europeanism will be a criterion for the selection of the next European Commissioners, the de facto government for the four hundred and fifty million citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I do not know how to explain to the citizens of the Czech Republic, whom I represent here, what this Europeanism actually is. I cannot say which of the present Commissioners and Members possess more or better Europeanism. I do not know what criteria are currently used to distinguish between a good and a bad European. I come from a country where, for decades, people did not get ahead as a result of their abilities, education, initiative and efficiency, but as a result of how loudly and how often they declared their commitment to a single political idea. Today, the countries of eastern Europe are still paying dearly for this way of running society in terms of economic backwardness. I should not like to live to see the promotion of concepts such as Europeanism in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by observing that this House voted in favour of the Constitution, with more than 500 Members voting to endorse it. We are therefore entitled to defend the Constitution to the public, and we are glad that the Commission is joining us in doing so.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second comment I would like to make has to do with the Foreign and Security Policy. I think the Commission has put forward a lot of good proposals and that it has the right idea – using the European Union’s economic strength to give it a voice in foreign policy and also drawing on the latest developments, in particular the Constitution. I would say to Mr Schulz that I think it is quite clear that prevention has to have priority, but prevention is ineffective without military capacities, which are the only means whereby pressure may be brought to bear. Both are necessary, but the use of armed force can only ever be the means of last resort.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the European Union also have to take care not to do this unilaterally, but as part of a multilateral framework. What this means is that we have to develop our trans-Atlantic relationships. I wish the Presidents of the Council and the Commission all the best for 22 February, when President Bush comes here and we start to make progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is another point I would like to address in the short time available to me. Tomorrow, President Yushchenko will be with us, and I think it has become clear to us over recent days – not least through debates in this House – that we cannot, right now, keep on enlarging the European Union ad infinitum, for that would make it incapable of welcoming new members. We also see, though, that the action programmes under the neighbourhood policy for Eastern Europe are inadequate. I would ask that we should think up some new ideas in this area, including multilateral frameworks, which might draw on such ideas as the European Economic Area. I see this as the only way in which we can reduce pressure and build up prospects, both of which are crucial at this present time, and I hope that this can be done.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last word must be to the President of the Commission, whom I urge to resist any attempts by the Council to structure the European External Action Service in such a way that it is not dependent on the Commission. We want a community Europe and not a new intergovernmental authority. Parliament is on your side.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Mr Barroso, my group Chairman, Mr Schulz, pointed out earlier today that, in our view, what you said in this House is along the right lines. That is something that I too believe as Chairman of the European Social Democrats. Clearly, we are in agreement. I must, however, say one more thing to you. Those of us in the PSE have a common allergy. Our allergy consists in reacting badly to mere lip service. My point is that it is very important, Mr Barroso, for you now really to take seriously what Mr Schulz has said today – something on which I should like to comment. It is important for your statements today to be followed up by practical action. Allow me to give you some examples.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is important, what you said today about the gap between rich and poor within the EU needing to become narrower. When, then, I see, on the front page of today’s Financial Times, your Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, saying that regional aid in the rich countries too must be scaled down, I perceive an inconsistency. You should be careful, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is also important, what you said today about our needing to create more and better jobs. Both Mr Schulz and I agree. Be careful, however, that old-fashioned recipes from the last century are not applied, based on the view that it was enough simply to talk about productivity and structural changes and not about what we need, namely greater investment and stronger demand in the European internal market. It is no use just focusing upon the supply side; in a modern economy, the demand side too must be focused upon. Without coordinated investment in training, innovation, regional policy and an active labour market policy, we do not get the jobs. I do not believe that you disagree, but I would ask you to confirm today that this is how the Commission President also sees matters. I would remind you that, six months ago, we presented an investment programme consisting of five points concerning five million new jobs in Europe. The programme can in fact be implemented and, as President of the Commission, you will have a crucial share of the responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="da">When, today, you talk about the European social model, I agree with you, but be careful that we do not separate matters. It is very important that you should not let yourself be pressurised by old-fashioned thinking in the European Union into first focusing upon economic productivity and only then seeing if we can afford more welfare and, if need be, more social security and more environmental investment. Take care; these matters are inseparable from one another. We must insist upon the European social model, economic productivity, social justice and environmental investment. That is the European way.</p>
      <p sl="da">When all is said and done, the challenge we both face can be summarised in the question: shall we compete in Europe under American or European conditions? That is what is at issue. We must find the answer together, and I am certain that we can do so.</p>
      <p sl="da">I listened to what the President of the Council, Mr Juncker, said not so very long ago when he emphasised that the European way involves a balance between the economy, social conditions and the environment. We expect to see this balance on 2 February when the first proposal comes from the Commission, enabling us to begin work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the five-year programme is far more focused and clear than the strategy achieved by the previous Commission. I would like to thank President Barroso for having drawn substantively upon the outcome of Parliament’s approval process for the new Commission. The programme deserves serious reaction from Parliament and from the European Council. To put the emphasis on prosperity as a first priority is certainly brave. There are few levers at the disposal of the Commission or the Council to control macro-economic policy. The Union has extremely limited fiscal power. Therefore the completion of the single market in services – financial and also public – is not a luxury: it is crucial. Personally, I would have wished to have seen greater stress on the importance of certain other Member States, including the UK, embracing the single currency within the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso said that bringing the Constitution into force is a first step to greater legitimacy. It must be said that it is a prerequisite for almost everything else that we find inside the programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, without the planned improvements to a common foreign, security and defence policy, the Union will be unable to play an effective part in global affairs, and relations with Russia and the USA will remain feeble and prone to quarrels.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President of the Commission, you have presented us with a good and high-quality strategic programme for the Commission for 2005. I am convinced that it is also a programme for the long term. I am adopting your programme and I am expressing my support for it because I believe that it is a programme which is good not just for the Commission but, in a broader sense, also for the Council and even for the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">You have heard today a largely positive reaction and it is clear that you have also heard our comments made at other sittings. One important step is now behind you, but the second is to achieve these targets. You will only be able to succeed in this if you can engage the Council and if you can also engage the Parliament in this project.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This period will also see the ratification of the Treaty establishing the European Constitution in the European Union. We are now persuading people that we have prepared this document for them, for the citizens of the European Union, that it is the European Union which will offer them protection if a nation state fails.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Union has devoted huge resources to the countries affected by the natural disaster of the tsunami. In Europe, however, we are witnesses to millions of victims of economic reforms, an economic tsunami – young people have fled eastern Europe in search of better conditions in western Europe, but the elderly are dependent upon our help. The European Union and Africa are afflicted every year by the AIDS tsunami. Tens of thousands are dying. I am therefore asking you to help these people. I also offer you my help with the programmes for old people and for those suffering from AIDS, but I also reserve the right to monitor these programmes.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have read with great interest the work programme for 2005, with its fine headings of ‘prosperity’, ‘solidarity’ and ‘security’, about which a great deal can be said. Being the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for development cooperation, it was with that in mind that I read the programme. The programme rightly notes that the European Union is responsible not only for the peace, prosperity and well-being of people in the European Union itself, but also has a responsibility with regard to the rest of the world, particularly the poorest countries. Five years ago, we in the European Union, together with other countries, adopted the so-called millennium objectives, which set out how we want to meet that responsibility. World poverty was to be halved by 2015, everyone was at least to enjoy basic education, the position of women was to be improved, the fight against AIDS stepped up and sustainable development promoted.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although we have fallen behind on achieving those objectives, they are still realistic. The European Union is doing a great deal, but much is yet to be done, especially in the areas of cohesion, cooperation and coordination. Those millennium objectives will not be achieved unless the international community, unless we in the European Union, considerably improve the quality of our aid. Resources can, and should, be deployed more effectively. At last week’s meeting of our Committee, Mr Sachs, of the UN’s millennium project challenged us with regard to the role of the European Union in the world, to which the work programme also makes reference. The European Union is still the largest donor, and the challenge is also to be the largest player on the stage in terms of vision, cohesion and leadership. In the area of development cooperation, too, there are very, very great challenges to be faced. I would call on the Commission to give this further careful consideration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, six months after you were appointed by the Council, you find yourself in a very privileged position. You effectively have a five-year mandate ahead of you and you have an extraordinary challenge – finally to put in place this Lisbon Strategy by providing it with real instruments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a privileged position, but also a paradoxical one, because, as you mentioned at the lunchtime press conference, when you were Prime Minister, you were not very keen on the Lisbon Strategy. We noticed this during the hearings, too. Today, however, your new responsibilities mean that this programme is now yours. It also represents the best means at your disposal to put the Union back on track and to enable it to face the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Essentially, today’s sitting is virtually a trial run for you to prepare what you are going to say to us next Wednesday, the substance of which is making the Lisbon Strategy the European project for the coming years. If you want to succeed in this perspective, you must ensure that this is based on the following three pillars: financial perspectives aimed at implementing the strategy; a stability pact that enables growth and competitiveness to take place in the Union in terms of sustainable development and employment; and EU policies that work towards this strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to strike the right balance, the most important thing is not to undervalue the social dimension, which, being in fact at the heart of the European social model’s elements of competitiveness, and of Europe’s strength, including international competitiveness, must not be pushed aside. This is what we are expecting of you and it is on the basis of a programme of your activities in this respect – your legislative programme – that we shall judge you, text by text in a European spirit, that is to say, with the desire to move forward in the service of our fellow citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also convinced that the construction and operation of the Trans-European Transport Networks can make a real contribution to Europe’s prosperity, including in the areas of solidarity and sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am not so much talking about the effects on demand of the large amount of investment required to build TENs, which ought to contribute to an increase in economic growth. In the framework of the Lisbon Strategy we should already have solved all the diplomatic, design and funding problems and now we should be ready to translate the investment into spending. In reality, that will not happen.</p>
      <p sl="it">Solid European cofinancing commitments for TENs, however, need to be drawn up before the financial perspectives are approved for 2006-2013 and possibly for a time horizon including the period after 2013, up to 2020. While we cannot expect rapid effects on demand from implementing TENs, we can instead expect a real and progressive contribution to the effective creation of the internal market in the enlarged Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Because of time and financial constraints, however, this result can only be achieved if the TEN implementation strategy is not left, so to speak, to the discretion of the Member States and to their local decisions, and to their ability or inability to cofinance the various sections and various projects. In fact, it is only in Brussels that the sections of the network can be identified. Their construction will have the effect of really creating a single market which is greater than others, albeit in the knowledge that the network effect will only be created with the completion of all the projects.</p>
      <p sl="it">All of this will only be possible if European cofinance is increased and, in certain notable cases, only if the Member States agree to an exceptional pooling of resources to construct TENs, which surely is incompatible with cutting the resources transferred to the Union by the Member States to 1% of European GDP.</p>
      <p sl="it">This possible increased financial responsibility of the European Union could also have the benefit of allowing a useful revision of the Stability Pact. Breaking the 3% ceiling could only be permitted if objectively linked to the above-mentioned infrastructures, as well as to research spending, and subjectively guaranteed by the executive Commission. It would be the Commission’s task to use the increased resources according to European priority criteria, such as making a greater contribution to unifying the market in the enlarged European Union, as I mentioned before.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an important debate. The emphasis the Commission places on creating prosperity in Europe is welcome and overdue. Central to success will be the outcome of the Lisbon Strategy – a review which will be discussed at the Spring European Council – and the language used on competitiveness, entrepreneurship, research, growth and jobs is more robust than under the last Commission. Mr Barroso, I believe that you are personally committed to genuine economic reform in Europe. Your record as Prime Minister of Portugal demonstrates you were interested in results, not simply rhetoric.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain cautious about the potential of both the Commission and certain Member States in terms of the need for effective and tough reform of Europe’s economies. The revised Lisbon Strategy must not be weighed down with political correctness, as in the past. Much has now changed – enlargement of the European Union has brought in countries which are strongly committed to flexible labour markets, to competitive taxation policies and the development of free trade. In addition, we face the major challenges of competing not just with the United States, but with the emerging giants in China and India. Europe simply cannot go on talking about reform to meet these challenges; it must now deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the emphasis on Member States applying EU legislation in their own countries. In the United Kingdom we have sometimes had a tendency to enforce legislation over-enthusiastically, while other Member States have a tendency at times to minimise the effects of the legislation they do not like. That is, of course, unacceptable. We must deliver less regulation, whether in the economic sphere or elsewhere. Previous Commissions talked about this. This Commission must deliver and we must make matters simpler – simpler for the people to understand and simpler to implement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will judge this Commission partly on its effectiveness in creating the environment for real reform, its commitment to less and better regulation and its determination to ensure that taxpayers’ money is used efficiently, while fraud and mismanagement are tackled with great vigour.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech made by President of the Commission Barroso deserves credit for the fact that it did not cast doubt upon the need to retain the European social model and did not push for any abandonment of it in the interests of greater competitiveness. What I missed in his speech, however, was any emphasis on the need to maintain and enhance social dialogue. What I have in mind here is negotiations between trade unions and employers’ associations at all levels, including the European level. I am convinced that everything which has been achieved in post-war Europe is the result of cooperation between sensible governments, employers’ organisations and trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">When looking at the proposals intended to help make Europe more competitive, its labour market more flexible and the business conditions more transparent and simple, I cannot help feeling that the last obstacle to actually achieving this are, in many people’s eyes, the democratically established powerful trade union organisations. Unfortunately, we are today witnesses to the fact that, especially in some of the countries which have recently acceded, representatives of the conservative parties are confusing social dialogue with social monologue. There have been attempts to replace industrial relations which have been in existence for more than a century with individual relations. This is supported by primitive arguments to the effect that all individuals are freely able to make decisions and assert themselves in the labour market. It is therefore a good thing that our group is placing emphasis on the creation of more, but also better jobs. Europe does not and never will want what American trade unionists fittingly call McJobs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There are many ways in which to dismantle a social state and some of them have unfortunately been tried with success in formerly wealthy and stable countries in the South American region. Therefore, no privatisation of public services, no privatisation of pension systems. I find most European labour legislation satisfactory, but what I find unsatisfactory is the inadequate control over what is approved and what is subsequently not observed and even contravened in some Member States. Mr President, how are you going to ensure that good European directives do not simply remain pieces of paper? Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I was delighted to hear that the Commission will be committed to the renewal of Europe. I think that renewal should really be the key word in the coming years, and I warmly welcome the similar noises I have heard from the presidency. We desperately need renewal, particularly in the economy. Although many Members have pointed to the drawbacks and possible pitfalls that reforms entail, I think we should spend more time talking about the drawbacks and pitfalls of the status quo. Reform requires political courage. Choices need to be made and political positions adopted. I hope that this Commission, unlike its predecessor, is prepared to do just that, rather than carry on tabling watered-down consensus proposals without any substance. Change almost always hurts. Change affects the vested interests, which perhaps partly explains the resistance that is being put up in certain circles. The longer we postpone the reforms, though, the greater the pain. Mr Barroso, we have a saying in the Netherlands to the effect that desperate times call for desperate measures. I do not know how you would translate that, but I think the message is clear.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although there is much talk about innovation, we are still investing in old systems, like an old agricultural system designed for the priorities of the Fifties, and social security systems designed for society half a century ago. We are still spending a great deal of public money to keep doomed and polluting industries afloat. We are still trying to solve the economic problems by running up public deficits. I hope that this Commission will press for investments in expertise and skills, in education, innovation, the environment and the services market, and I would call on the presidency and the Member States to do the same. I hope that the Commission will simply stick to its guns. Instead of old policies, we should invest in free markets, open markets, initiative and entrepreneurship.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my mother is in the habit of reminding me that he who focuses upon everything has, in fact, no focus. I therefore hope that the Commission dares to prioritise and to choose a focus in the form, obviously, of what is most important, namely growth. There is no magic about creating growth. In actual fact, everyone knows what needs to be done and why Europe is slipping behind, but there are few who dare talk about it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What, in reality, is needed is not more power or money for the EU, but political courage. Courage is needed to dare to stand up and implement a number of radical reforms designed to obtain the competitiveness we need and to get away from over-regulation and over-taxation of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">An important tool for increased growth is free trade. The EU should be the European power, and the world’s strongest power, fighting specifically for free world trade. The EU project is based upon free trade and upon creating peace, prosperity and freedom. It can be of a very great deal of help in other parts of the world too.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Unfortunately, the EU often does the opposite and instead sets up further barriers to trade. Poor and vulnerable countries are robbed of prosperity and opportunities through customs duties. The immorality of this became additionally clear when, in December, the EU increased the duties on perfumes and spices from countries such as Thailand and Sri Lanka. Those countries that have been affected by the tsunami disaster need trade in order to pursue their own development, and they definitely do not need new customs duties. The fact that Europe too loses out due to what is an immoral policy is becoming clearer than ever now that Thailand is talking about refusing to buy the prestige European Airbus as a consequence of the trade policy that imposes duties on fishermen specifically in Thailand.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I should therefore like to call upon the Commission to do everything it can to stand up for free trade and to try to go down in history as the European Commission that was most friendly to free trade.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing unclear about what the most important item is in the Commission’s work programme. It is the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy, which is to say, our global competitiveness, as fast as possible. Lisbon can be compared to a pyramid: at its top is Research and Development, which for us is both a tool and an opportunity, although only two countries have implemented this 3% objective for GDP.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The next level down is taken up by ICT, the information and communications industry. It is both a means of accomplishing objectives and the fastest growing way of producing results. ICT’s share of our gross domestic product is already approximately 10%. Digital literacy is vital therefore, because, for example, the majority of our office workers lose around three hours of working time every week due to computer problems. What are we to do? Should we extend the working week or should we teach digital literacy?</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the same time we need to remember that the top of the pyramid will cave in if it is not founded on socially and environmentally sustainable development. That is our European model, the precondition for our competitiveness. I am pleased that you, Mr Barroso, include solidarity as a basis for our success, but there is still much to be done. Non-solidarity, that western import, is becoming more and more evident at all levels of our society and between them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission has taken the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy as its objective. The power of decision, however, remains with the Member States. Only a small minority have implemented the necessary legislation. The non-solidarity movement therefore reigns within us. The Union’s goal of competitiveness will not be achieved if the majority of Member States apply the brakes. I would like to ask Mr Barroso how the Commission intends to persuade the Member States to implement the agreed laws jointly. Otherwise, it is to be feared that this will become a Soviet-style five-year plan, which will only be implemented on paper.</p>

    <intervention id="3-050" speaker_id="28127" name="Ek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, these are ambitious goals for next year’s legislation that are being presented. The problem is simply that, as usual, there are so many goals that there is a danger of there being no prioritisation at all.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I wish to create an EU that is slimmer but sharper edged, that does less but is better at what it does and that takes vigorous action on issues of common interest, while leaving other issues to be decided at national, regional or local levels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Stable and sustained growth is needed in Europe. The EU’s competitiveness needs to be improved, perhaps more than we think. The United States is now discussing the growth that exists in China and is making ambitious plans for achieving the same levels. Meanwhile, we in Europe are still discussing the United States. In that way, we are already several steps behind. Europe has huge potential for growth, which must be released, but it needs to muster its strength and to prioritise. Otherwise, the Lisbon process is in danger of bearing out Groucho Marx’s statement that ‘[p]olitics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it, misdiagnosing it, and then misapplying the wrong remedies’. Sustainable development is the basis for growth, and the programme is too weak where this aspect is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, freedom of movement within the EU presupposes that people feel they have legal security when they leave their own countries to study, work or take holidays in other Member States. Unfortunately, there are at present far too many people who have not obtained the right to fair trials and legally secure treatment when they have been suspected of committing crimes in other countries. Common guarantees in this area are, of course, in preparation, but we have now waited so many years for these. It is important for these issues of legal security to be resolved so that people dare to make use of the four freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a couple of ideas I would like to pick up on. We are in the first half of 2005; we are also discussing the financial framework – the very financial framework that will be your concern, Mr Barroso, throughout your term of office. That being so, I expect your proposals to take into consideration what financial instruments are available to you to enable you to actually accomplish the things you have set yourself to do. I have no sympathy whatever for your desire to continue handling budgetary payments in the same way as the previous Commission did. There, I think, the Commission has some more catching up to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same is also true where own resources are concerned. How does the European Union fund itself? This is where the Commission could perhaps put some new proposals before us as to how we embark on a time of innovation – not only in its work programme, but also in the European Union’s financial arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me raise something that I have already often had to speak about, both here and in Strasbourg: you are quite right to say that Europe has to make sure it can compete and must create jobs. We are eagerly waiting for the Commission to revise the proposal that the colleague to the left of you, Mrs Wallström, brought in when she was Commissioner for the Environment for this mammoth REACH project, which enhances the competitiveness of industries outside the European Union rather than that of those within it. If you want to do something to help create jobs, then withdraw REACH and take a closer look at the whole thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now I read that Commissioner Kyprianou wants to regulate even the grilling of hamburgers, the last area of employment left to us. I thought we had seen the last of this sort of nonsense when Mr Byrne finally departed the scene. You have to consider which model of society you are defending – one in which people are free or one in which they are led by the nose? I supported you because I thought you were in favour of freedom, so I would ask you to introduce some!</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-052" speaker_id="4425" name="Sacconi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that I had prepared a different speech. However, what Mr Ferber said a moment ago somehow forces me to speak about the REACH dossier – as I am the rapporteur on it – which Mr Ferber held up as the greatest threat to the competitiveness of European industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hold exactly the opposite view. I think it is always wrong to turn a specific piece of legislation into a symbol of either good or evil. In any case, I think that if REACH is a symbol, it is precisely pointing the way towards a new competitive future for Europe’s industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is happening in the world to leave our competitiveness in crisis and in question? We are witnessing a great international redistribution of work, as has happened before at other times in world economic and industrial history. Europe has not yet succeeded in finding its own space, its own trump cards, in this great transformation. It identified them in the Lisbon strategy, but it has only been able to develop and expand them in a very small way.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Barroso, I recognise that the list of priorities that you have indicated, for which an interinstitutional partnership ought to be established, is a fair one and I believe that it is precisely on that basis that we need to address this major turning point in Europe’s competitiveness. Our trump cards are knowledge and the environment. Europe is going to become a world leader in those areas, and it is now in a position to achieve that.</p>

    <intervention id="3-053" speaker_id="4292" name="Radwan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, you were right to include Lisbon in your work programme – the Lisbon that is intended to make Europe the most competitive global region. I am sure everyone in this Chamber thinks we want to achieve that; the question now arises of how we do it. Some of it Europe can afford, and I would urge you to focus your work programme rather more on the self-employed and small businesses instead of solely on large-scale industries or on more innovative sectors; important though these certainly are, most businesses – truism though it is to say so – are small ones or one-man operations. Your programme does not, unfortunately, do justice to their importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other thing I want to say is that you have to monitor the Member States in this respect and point out when they have to implement the necessary reforms. I have high expectations of the Commission actually doing that, but I have to say that, having first vowed to stand up to the Council, the Commission gave up even before embarking on its first contest with them. That brings me to the Stability and Growth Pact. Look at your Commission and the Commissioner with responsibility for these matters; it is apparent to me from the statements he makes that all he is doing is picking the Council’s proposals to pieces. Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, I think back to the time when Mr Juncker joined us in Committee and said: ‘You have to learn’. He was right: politicians, too, have to learn. The problem with the Pact is that it is those who offend against it – the finance ministers – who decide among themselves whether or not the Pact is to apply. You ought to fight to have the Commission given greater power in this area. In the areas we are discussing, though, it is unfortunate that the Commission is not doing that, but simply walking behind the Council and making life even easier for it. This is where Mr Solbes was a good example of the sort of commitment required, and a good yardstick by which to measure it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me, in addition, urge you not to indulge in the Prodi Commission’s obstructive tactics, for the Commissioners at the time, who played a part in them, had their work cut out – Mrs Wallström, who is here today, spent five years helping to make Europe the most competitive area. Judge by the results, and, if you do not make a quick job of putting a stop to bureaucracy, you will end up the same way as the Prodi Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe, Mr President of the Commission, and we have already witnessed this, that you have great political ability. You have created and continue to create a certain amount of unanimity around yourself and your intentions. Having said that, I would like to strike a more downbeat note.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Listening to you, we should be channelling our efforts into turning Europe into the most competitive economy and from the competitiveness thus achieved there would be a flood of jobs that would benefit everyone. Mr President, I do not share that view and there are a number of us who do not share that view. This is because your programme does not provide the right responses to the problems encountered by Europe and its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that, at the moment, economic growth is too weak and must be stepped up. How should this be done, though, and for whom? The by-products of growth should help to improve our citizens’ lives, should be shared by everyone, and should favour the less-privileged members of society. Apart from the lack of jobs, our citizens are suffering from insecurity of employment. Our healthcare, social security and retirement systems are under threat. With the advent of globalisation, more and more people are feeling insecure about their lives. Now more than ever the Union needs a strong political plan, but in order to achieve the Europe that we want, we need that strong political plan to come from a social perspective, a plan for society that enables every individual to lead a fulfilling life, a plan based on solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want our children to continue to enjoy a high standard of education that is accessible to all, if we want public services to continue to strengthen social cohesion, if we want jobs to enable each individual to lead a decent, fulfilling life and if we want older people to have a proper retirement, we must do much more than stake our entire future on the uncertain rewards of a policy of competitiveness at all costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in your programme, you could, in my opinion, have placed greater emphasis on strengthening the EU’s social dimension, because it is precisely policies of this nature that are at the forefront of the citizens’ concerns, and I feel that you have not done this. Far from it, in fact; it strikes me that when our social protection systems and our public services come under attack, it is the citizens of Europe who stand to suffer from the proposals that you are tabling. In this respect, Mr President, I should like to ask you to make the right decision and withdraw Mr Bolkestein’s draft directive, which in its current form would not be acceptable to us.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would like to thank the President of the Commission for the concise, clear and powerful presentation of his work programme, although I would prefer to call it an action plan for the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like, though, to make one observation, namely that it will not be possible to assess many of the action points you have mentioned until March and April when we know what the renewed Lisbon process brings, and, while I am on that subject, there is one aspect of the Lisbon process that gives me slight cause for concern. We are all talking about a strategy, the strategy in which competition, growth, more jobs, but also sustainability, are central. It is impossible to lift one element from a strategy. You have spoken about social sustainability, rightly so, but I have not heard you utter one word about ecological sustainability, which should be part and parcel of the Lisbon strategy if it is to work. I am therefore assuming that social and ecological sustainability will soon be given more attention in the Lisbon process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have already had a chance to leaf through your statement. I do not actually find in it – although you will perhaps return to this later – any reference to mobility in Europe, about the need for us not only to sort out the financial services issue, but also that of qualifications, and to ensure that a migrant worker or tradesman feels at home in Europe. For this to happen, we must ensure that more jobs are created.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President of the Commission, bearing in mind your political commitments towards the European Parliament, it is important, at this crucial stage, for you to promote in deed rather than just in word the integration and extension of policies for the economic, social and regional cohesion of the Europe of the 25 Member States, as well as for its competitiveness. One focal issue of general scope which guarantees solidarity is the adequate safeguarding of own resources which will be able to effectively cover all cohesion policies, including those which derive from the Lisbon Strategy. You ought to contribute to the stabilisation of the financial perspectives, as did your predecessor, Mr Prodi.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within the framework of your annual legislative work, which will, moreover, also form the basis on which you are judged, and in cooperation with the competent Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mrs Fischer Boel, it is vital that you proceed with certain basic, material actions: first, adequate financing of agriculture and reinforcement of rural development policies; secondly, substantive measures so as to avoid disrupting rural income and creating financial distortions between Member States and regions during the implementation of the new CAP and international trade agreements; thirdly, the avoidance of any cofinancing philosophy, by which I mean the renationalisation of the CAP and, fourthly, dynamic negotiations with international trading partners within the framework of the WTO, so that they too can adjust to broken promises concerning the development of third countries. To close, I should like to point out that 2005 is a period during which we shall all be judged by the European citizens and in which we shall also protect ourselves as a single, democratic, international Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Barroso has rightly highlighted the Lisbon Agenda. As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I would say that prerequisites for that agenda are a healthy environment and healthy people. There is work to be done in this year’s programme. On chemicals, we know that we do not have enough knowledge about them. Most chemicals we depend on, some we handle with care and some need to be phased out or banned. We need a workable proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">REACH as such is costly, would take some 50 years to implement and would lose some six million lives of animals in the process. The Commission should come forward with proposals that accept and adopt issues such as the ‘one substance, one registration’ proposal, or that on computer profiling and prioritisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On climate change, we need to recognise that the consequences of global warming are not just creeping up on us, they are exploding in unexpected and devastating ways across our world. We need the United States as a partner on climate change. There is no point in hammering about Kyoto to it, there is every point in encouraging the United States to develop its own policies and work with us to help save our planet.</p>
      <p sl="en">On patient mobility, the courts have ruled that patients have the right to go to other Member States if they face undue delay in their own country. That is a great opportunity for patients, but it is a big headache for health service budget managers. It is urgent that we make the opportunity of patients a reality with effective guidance. If we fail to take a political lead on this and establish the ground rules, then the courts will continue to make policy for us. That is not the sort of Europe that I want to see, dictated to simply by court decisions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President of the Commission, this programme offers a general framework that accommodates everyone’s priorities. What matters most, however, is that it be implemented. We will not be able to assess you until such time as we receive the concrete policy measures, and I urge that this be done at the earliest opportunity. If you take Lisbon’s social pillar seriously, I would ask of you three things. First of all, that all new proposals be verified in terms of their social implications and not only in competitive terms, as is indicated in the Commission document. Secondly, that the Commission should finally enact a framework directive regulating services of general interest, which are vital for social cohesion and solidarity. Thirdly, that you, Mr Barroso, create clarity about the services directive. Commissioner Verheugen has said that the REACH proposal will be adapted and will undergo a general overhaul. I would ask the same from you, and for an undertaking in respect of the Bolkestein directive: that there will be an internal market in services, but without social dumping, something on which the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, has also insisted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would be interested to know which countries’ deficits have increased in recent years, which countries have raised their tax rates, and in which countries more people have become unemployed. I think your policy is the right one; you are trying to ensure that Europe does not spend the time until 2010 following those countries’ policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask Commissioner Wallström which countries have actually created jobs. Who has created the most new jobs? Who has cut taxes? Who has achieved a Budget surplus? The fact that we have these two paths before us is something of which I think we have to remind ourselves. Do we want the one or the other? The Commission under Mr Barroso has made it quite clear that the Lisbon Strategy is intended, between now and 2010, to create new jobs, increase wages in real terms and put Europe in a better position as regards global competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">To do that, we have to invest in research. I believe that we have to double the funding for the Sixth Framework Programme. Although it has already been laid down in black and white, I believe we also have to get all 25 countries to conform to it; we have to take inflation into account and also lay down a proper timeframe for it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must work to at last complete the internal market, to have a competitive system for transporting energy across borders, and it is vitally important that we use e-Government, e-Learning, and e-Europe to make what Europe is about accessible once and for all. There is much to be done. I think Commissioner Wallström has to be supported by all of us in making the European Union present and visible to the European citizens of the future. This is where we have a lot to offer, and, here in this House too, we have to think up completely new ways of becoming more comprehensible to the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">By way of conclusion, let me suggest that the repayments to the Member States should be made conditional on added value to Europe and on subsidiarity, thus ensuring that the European Budget is actually used to benefit the public.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Barroso’s strategic objectives because, for the first time, they set prosperity as the number one goal, the first step towards which is a friendly business environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – which I have the privilege of leading for the PPE-DE Group – will work with you and your services to achieve those twin aims. The internal market is absolutely crucial in this respect, with 2005 marking a critical stage in the process, and I am delighted that you have identified the huge growth potential of services in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive on the internal market for services is quite rightly an ambitious and wide-ranging project. Members on my side of the House will work with you to deliver the growth market for services by pushing ahead with that important directive. Changes may be needed in order for it to work, but you have our backing. Do not listen to the siren voices on the other side of the House urging you to slow down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is this internal market for services directive so important? It is important because we must move the internal market forward to the next stage, where Member States start to trust each other to organise and control the market. We must make mutual recognition work, be it for goods or services. Why can we not have country of origin control of business establishment? Why can we not exchange information between administrations? Why can we not trust governments to deliver? Members on the other side of the House do not want this directive because they do not trust governments to deliver. Indeed, the word ‘trust’ does not appear. However, I know you will not back down, and hope that you will take forward with the Council the task of making the internal market work and of ensuring that internal market rules are enforced properly on the ground so that we can achieve our goals of a better environment and jobs and prosperity for everyone.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is now my turn to say something about transport, about which I think the Commission’s communications have had too little to say. You can order everything conceivable via every conceivable kind of electronic connection, but to trade goods – whether a fridge or a computer – you have to actually deliver the thing, and for that you need a proper transport policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your Vice-President, Commissioner Barrot, has made a very sensible statement outlining what we need, and I want now to recapitulate the three core issues. I believe that the internal market needs to be made a reality in the railway sector too. For 40 years, the railways have thought there was no such thing and that they could carry on making railway policy at national level. Now is the time to use the Third Railway Package to open up the passenger transport networks, and to bring in a single locomotive drivers’ licence, thereby doing away with the need for trains to stop and change crew at national borders. The only way we will be able to use railways for cross-border transport is if they are fast, efficient and well-organised, and for that the networks need to be opened up, there needs to be a locomotive drivers’ licence, but passengers also have to have proper rights when they are left standing waiting or when their journeys are delayed. The rules on compensation for air travellers are very good, but far more people travel by train, and they are just as entitled to compensation when the railways fail to organise themselves properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Alongside the railways, there is the issue of the ‘Eurovignette’. Infrastructure costs need to be charged in a fair way, one that also has to be economically sustainable and structured in an environmentally-friendly way. This is an area in which we have to make headway.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final and crucial point, Mr President, is one that I trust you have already taken to heart. We need proper trans-European transport routes, not only as part of the rail and road networks, but also in the inland waterways sector. We really do need cross-border transport routes and a network of all means of transport, so that we can make real advances in the trade of goods. They need to be competitive, they need to be economically sustainable, and they need to be laid out in such a way that they do no damage to the environment.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, taking the baton from Mr Jarzembowski, I shall speak about cohesion and regional policy issues and I should like to say to Mr Barroso that we agree with the Commission text, because it places the right emphasis on cohesion policies. Nor could it be otherwise, given that this year, 2005, will also be a crucial year for the future of regional policy. Within this framework, I should like to make two very specific comments: the first comment concerns the timing of decisions. I trust that decisions will be taken during the Luxembourg Presidency and I should also like, along these lines, to ask Mr Schmit, the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, to do his very best, because regional policy programmes are multiannual programmes and any delay would have adverse repercussions on the development of the programmes.</p>
      <p sl="el">We shall have problems during the next period and we must all, each for his own part, do whatever we can this year to bring the decision making to a close. The second element which I should like to highlight concerns the size of the new financing package for regional policy. I wish to be perfectly clear: we cannot go below the European Commission's proposals, which talk of 0.41% of gross national income for cohesion policies. If we go below that, there can be no talk of a credible regional policy, because we have far more needs with enlargement and these needs will have to be financed. Consequently, I think that we need to move in this direction. I believe that you will also have the support of the European Parliament, but we must not forget that we cannot want more Europeans with enlargement, but less Europe. If we want more Europeans, we must also want more Europe. We need to understand that an efficient Union also means a Union with financing. I understand the needs of the taxpayers, I want to be realistic in my approach, I have no desire to be maximalist but, on the other hand, I think that realism dictates that we follow the European Commission's proposal which, I repeat, makes provision for 0.41% of gross national income in regional policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it will not take me long to explain the priorities for European agriculture that concern us in 2005. They have to do with rural development and how it is to be funded. The Commission has presented us with its proposals on the subject, and we are working on them. In principle, the Commission’s approach is to be welcomed; only recently, Commissioner Fischer Boel gave us to understand that the proposals on rural development had to be – and were – in line with the Lisbon process. That is something we in this House will take on board.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, rural development is also and especially a matter of funding, and we have to keep a very close eye on the work of the temporary committee on the 2007 – 2013 Financial Perspective as far as this matter is concerned. Unless we know what the financial facts and possibilities are, there is no point in us discussing what and how much Lisbon will do about rural development.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the WTO, the 2003 agricultural reforms have increased our margin for negotiation in the agriculture sector; now we have to use it, while adopting a defensive stance in order to maintain the European model of agriculture. If one disregards the issue of its implementation at national level, which is a cause of concern to quite a few of us in this House, the 2003 agriculture reform left a number of issues outstanding. The markets in sugar, fruit and vegetables are ripe for reform, as is the wine sector. In all these sectors, we should wait and see what practical proposals the new Commission comes up with; nothing is to be gained by poking around in the dark. No doubt Commissioner Fischer Boel is perfectly well acquainted with the aspects that matter to this House, and it remains to be seen to what extent her proposals will take our concerns into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">I ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to give some thought to renewable energies, which I believe provide a good alternative source of income for our farmers if there is proper support for them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually very glad to have been able to hear Mr Barroso speak today, but I did not, unfortunately, get the same feeling of euphoria that I did from his speech in Berlin. There was not much evidence today of the desire to ‘give Europe a soul’. When you reported on your work programme, words like ‘culture’, ‘education’ and ‘schooling’ occurred less frequently than any of us in the Committee on Culture and Education would have wished, particularly as we are all well aware that these areas have a very great part to play in the process of integration and in the Lisbon process.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it really is time for all these speeches and symposia to be backed up by actions that the public will sit up and notice, actions that they will welcome as adding value to Europe. You did admittedly say earlier that investment in education is important, in that it promotes growth and employment, but what you say must, of course, be reflected in what you do. I would add to that the need for the Commission to create more incentives to learn languages, for learning languages is important. Learning your neighbour’s language matters, because it builds another bridge between you and them, and our young people’s mobility in the internal market depends on it.</p>
      <p sl="de">It truly would be great if you, Mr President of the Commission, were really to take up the cause of the new ‘Lifelong Learning’ programme, and if the money that I, on behalf of my fellow Members, have been demanding for it, were actually to be forthcoming. That would be in line with what you are seeking through the Lisbon strategy. The preamble to the new Constitution speaks of the need to strengthen Europe’s ‘unity in diversity’, but if that is to happen, the Member States have to come round to accepting that there is such a thing as a European cultural area and have to enjoy its advantages. The culture industry creates an enormous number of jobs. Like education and schooling, it is compatible with the Lisbon strategy. It is quite simply ridiculous, and shameful, that only 0.03% of the total budget is allocated to culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore ask you, Mr President, and all your fellow Commissioners, to invest in education and culture; by so doing, you will really help Europe to gain a soul.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the legal policy experts in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I want to sum them up under four headings.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am glad to see that your programme includes better regulation and impact assessment, which could be summed up as the business of estimating the cost of compliance with laws. I would like to make it quite clear that our Committee attaches particular importance to the text of this agreement being taken seriously and to you not merely signing affirmations, like the one your predecessor signed in December 2003. That means that proper consultation processes have to be gone through, and there also – quite crucially – has to be sufficient transparency and, in contrast to what has often, unfortunately, happened with Commission proposals, a real impact assessment rather than one that can be said to do no more than help to justify the proposal. We have our own expectations in this respect and are addressing them to the new Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although I am glad you have addressed a number of aspects of the Company Law Action Plan that had already been put forward by the former Commission, I want to draw attention to two that we regard as important. One is the need for a proposal on the right to choose between the single-tier and two-tier systems of company law, and the second is that the ‘one share, one vote’ principle – which was the subject of very in-depth discussion during the previous legislative period – must be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to intellectual property rights, we welcome the Commission’s intention to present a proposal on the regulation of rights management societies. At the same time, though, we ask it to examine the rightness or otherwise of its strategy to date in relation to the European patent, with a view to finding out whether there is the danger, in view of the current state of discussions in the Council, of what comes out at the other end being a monstrosity that small and medium-sized businesses cannot afford. Perhaps we should wait for the Constitution and then produce a new proposal on a new legal basis and with new majorities, out of which something decent will emerge.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least comes something of which I ask you not to lose sight. I believe that the most important proposal for the making of ‘soft law’ in the term of this Parliament will be the harmonisation of civil law. Groups of professors are currently working on a frame of reference for this, which will shape European civil law for over a century to come. I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to bear that, too, in mind.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, if you ask the citizens of our Member States what is important to them in their daily lives, the need for security is top of their list of priorities. People judge whether the Commission and this Parliament are successful or not on the basis of whether we can offer them security in their own country, in their own homes, and in Europe. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I therefore very much welcome the proposed strategic guidelines and basic principles, and the priorities that have been set.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would, however, like to take this opportunity to point out that political will and practical implementation are often not the same thing. The improved monitoring and surveillance of our enlarged Europe’s external borders are within the scope of the tasks outlined by the Commission, and in this it has our wholehearted support, but one thing that will be crucial in terms of its success will be whether or not the Council will once and for all resolve the issue of where the Borders Agency is to be based, thereby enabling it to start functioning.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to effective controls, the introduction of European passports and visa documents that are proof against counterfeiting and falsification would be a good starting point, as would the inclusion of biometric data in these documents. Progress must also be made with operational cooperation by police forces in a Europe with open internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is needed is European machinery rather than national measures; on that, this House agrees with the Commission, but the Council has for over a year been unable to agree on a new head for Europol. Whilst assuring the Commission and its President that we are alongside them in this, I would appeal to the Council to again give its attention to the points I have enumerated.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President of the Commission, I followed the presentation of your programme and I totally share your vision for a Europe of the citizens and, at the same time, a Europe which is responsible and effective on the international stage. I also share your strategic choices in order for us to achieve this vision. We shall, moreover, also have the opportunity to discuss the individual policies both within the framework of our political groups and within the framework of our parliamentary committees, as well as other opportunities for discussion and cooperation with you. At the end of this day rich in ideas and discussions, I should like to point out that the efforts we need to make are many, varied, interactive and inter-dependent. They relate to all aspects of our economy and society. No-one can say that the economy is more important than social cohesion, that transport is more important than equal opportunities for both sexes.</p>
      <p sl="el">The policy we have followed over recent years has not borne the fruit we expected in terms of either growth or social cohesion. We have no room for either inertia or delay. The survival of our social model, the credibility of the European Union, the belief of citizens in this vision are being judged. We experienced this acutely during the recent European elections and we promised the citizens that we would change everything. The hour is therefore nigh for us to implement these changes. The reality and the challenges we have before us demand boldness, changes and innovation. We have spent enough years talking about reforms which have never come about or which did not come about to an adequate degree. As you know, reforms which are announced and discussed but which do not come about are harmful. They create confusion, insecurity and pessimism, irrespective of whether they concern bureaucracy, the insurance system or the pension system. They restrict consumption, they restrict entrepreneurship and they tie Europe down to the low rates of growth which we have today. Be bold, Mr President, my political group will stand by you. Pave the way for a new Europe with dynamism and hope.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the President of the Commission for the report he has presented to this House, which augurs well for the coming months and years. I have picked out a few key points from his speech – which was obviously very general in nature – on which I believe we should focus our attention and our energies.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the first place, I think it is clear to everyone that the challenges that Europe has set itself – which we have taken up and will continue to take up – are to a great extent, although not explicitly, contained in the Lisbon project. Nonetheless, we are aware that this week and in the coming months we are dealing with an issue – the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 – on which everything else depends.</p>
      <p sl="it">I share your opinion that one cannot have ‘more Europe with less money’. I would also add that one cannot implement the Lisbon strategy without money and one cannot make progress with a cohesion policy, which all the countries are calling for, without having the necessary resources available. I believe cohesion is essential for us, and I would also like to include here the subject of women, a topic which I would always ask you to bear in mind, as it is a factor for strength and innovation which you may find it useful to take forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also share the opinion that agreement on the Financial Perspective cannot come at any price. Bold choices will also probably be needed to achieve our objectives, and I call on you to take action in that respect. I therefore propose reopening the debate on agricultural funding, on the need to press ahead with the policy on services, and also on the REACH programme, about which all the Member States have reservations and which it would therefore be appropriate to review.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to issue a request to Mr Barroso. We have discussed the strategic guidelines this afternoon. Mr President of the Commission, I feel that we might agree with what you have proposed to us, but there is a problem. We have not in fact been able to talk about the 2005 legislative programme because Parliament is not yet familiar with the programme. Along with some of my fellow Members of this House, I was able to get hold of the text at the beginning of the afternoon, but many others were not able to do so. It is absolutely essential that the Members are able to work, in each parliamentary committee, within the framework of your proposal and that we can hold another debate during the next session here in Brussels or in Strasbourg on the 2005 legislative programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the request that I wanted to make on behalf of the group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is important. I should like to remind you that there was an agreement between the previous Commission and Parliament to the effect that the legislative programme should be forwarded to the Members of the House at least ten working days before the debate in plenary, so that they can familiarise themselves with it. This is stipulated in annex 14 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Mr President, I am sure that you will agree that we should have a fresh debate on the 2005 legislative programme.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-071" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="pt">I shall begin by clearing up the point raised by Mrs Grossetête. The arrangement between us is that Parliament is the first to be notified of major decisions taken by the Commission. It was in fact today, this morning, that we adopted the five-year strategic programme and the work programme for 2005, and this is why it only arrived here today – it was only today that we adopted it. Parliament therefore received the work programme for 2005 immediately.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Today’s debate has certainly not taken the place of another possible debate on the work programme for 2005, which will definitely happen. I feel that Parliament wants the Commission to come here as soon as it adopts its work programmes, which is why we are here today, having adopted both the strategic programme and the work programme for 2005 this morning.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We shall certainly be more than happy to attend a further debate with specific regard to the work programme for 2005. The main purpose of coming here today was essentially to set out the strategic guidelines for the next five years. As some of the Members of this House have acknowledged, things have been done differently this time: the Commission has decided not to give you a bureaucratic or technocratic programme containing hundreds of pages. Instead, it has decided to make some choices, to present you with the major strategic guidelines and thus to present you with a clear document.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have proposed a partnership to you and Parliament has responded favourably to this partnership. We have proposed priorities to you and it has clearly transpired that the issues that concern the Commission are precisely those that concern Parliament. The conditions are therefore now in place for us, along with the Council, to present our fellow citizens with a programme and a strategic perspective for the next five years.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this respect, I should also like to welcome the presence, for much of this debate, of the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Juncker. As he encouragingly said, there is broad agreement on how to proceed. The Commission, the Council and, of course, Parliament, with the help and support of the Luxembourg Presidency, will therefore, in the next few weeks, seek to achieve interinstitutional coordination, and thus be in a position to make a joint statement on the strategic objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This means, Mr President, honourable Members, that you can count on the Commission and that, with determination and a sense of responsibility, we can achieve a common project and can consolidate a partnership for a renewed Europe. In so doing, we are pre-empting the spirit of the Constitution. In so doing, we are demonstrating that all three of our institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are capable of setting out a clear vision for the future. I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your support and for your attention.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now is clearly the time, however, to translate this strategic programme into practical action. The Members of this House have focused on a point that was also a concern in today’s Commission meeting, and that point is delivery. We wish to concentrate on delivery, on effective implementation, whereby plans do not remain in documents and on paper, but instead the citizens see that something is happening and that we are actually putting those plans into action.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first step towards such implementation, the first step towards translating this strategic programme into action – which, I note, has received overwhelming support here today – will be the review of the Lisbon Strategy. We shall be in this House next week to present the so-called Lisbon mid-term review, because the aim is to translate our priorities into action, particularly the priority of prosperity, which, in practical terms, means growth and jobs; growth and jobs as priorities. We have always said, however, that there are many elements of the Lisbon Strategy competing to achieve this objective and some of the Members of this House have noted that there may be problems in relation to certain legislative initiatives. I should like to say to you that these issues will be covered when we present the review of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">You will therefore be able to see that this Commission does what it says and says what it does; that it has the courage to table proposals and the ambition to turn those proposals into action. I should also like to say at this point that I am counting on your support.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should now like to answer some of the general questions asked during the debate. First is the question of cohesion. If there is one area in which, frankly, you do not need to argue with us, it is that of cohesion. This Commission does not need any convincing in this area; we understand that cohesion is an essential element of the European model. What we now need is your support so that there is practical support, if possible during the Luxembourg Presidency, for the new financial perspectives. Indeed, we have seen a range of priorities today, as we have seen in previous debates, that can only be implemented if the EU has resources that are commensurate with its ambitions. We have spoken in this House about the transport network for Europe, education and culture, which, again, we shall look at in more detail when we present the Lisbon Strategy, because we consider what we refer to as ‘knowledge for growth’ and ‘knowledge for development’ an essential element of this reviewed strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some of you have also spoken today about cohesion in relation to the weakest regions, those regions that are lagging behind, be they in the new Member States or in the old Member States, be they in the wealthiest countries or in the least-developed countries. The truth is that we must strive to achieve cohesion, because without cohesion there is no solidarity, and without solidarity the very idea of the Union ceases to exist. Consequently, what I ask the Members of this House is that we also do this with our governments – with the governments of the various Member States – to gain support for the concept of solidarity, a concept of genuine cohesion in relation to the least-privileged sections of society and to the regions of our Union that are lagging furthest behind.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Our model is the European model. I trust that there is no doubt about this. The European model is our model. Nonetheless, we are in a world of globalisation and increased competition, and we have many challenges ahead of us. We must therefore learn from what others do without changing our model.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of research into new technologies, for example, we are behind some of our partners. I am not suggesting that we should replace our model with theirs. I am suggesting that Europe should do more in terms of supporting research into new technologies, whilst maintaining and strengthening the component parts of our model.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I was therefore very pleased, Mr President, to see that in this House today there has been virtually no theological debate, in the negative sense of the word, about our priority objectives and that it has been possible for us, over the course of this debate, to move closer to a broad consensus, and to demonstrate that economic dynamism and a liberalised and dynamic internal market are not incompatible with justice and social cohesion. We must work simultaneously on both axes – towards both greater liberalisation of the markets and increased social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true that if we do achieve the consensus that can be seen here today, this would confirm that we are capable of turning our diversity – and the diversity of opinions in Parliament and in society – into a strength and not a weakness. I am especially pleased to see that a programme that is a programme for change and a partnership that is a partnership for renewal can achieve a broad consensus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On my first visit to Parliament, I promised you, ladies and gentlemen, that I would work in complicity with Parliament. I said this to you, Mr President, and I said it to all of the political forces. The Commission is demonstrating that it keeps its promises. We have heard your concerns during these debates and we are prepared to work within this relationship of positive complicity with Parliament. I therefore wish to congratulate Parliament. I should also like to say that what I want, and what the entire Commission wants, is to work with you and to ask for your support – along with your criticisms when you feel that there is good reason to criticise the Commission – because with your support we can be sure that we will drive forward our partnership for a renewed Europe over the course of the next five years.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso stated the Commission´s intention to stimulate greater economic growth and cohesion throughout the EU. The strategic statement coincides with the publication of latest Eurostat wealth figures which highlight the poor performance of Scotland compared with other similarly sized European nations. The GDP per capita figures show Scotland trailing behind other small countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Finland.</p>
      <p sl="en">These new EU figures are just the latest to show that the Scottish economy is seriously under-performing. Small countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Finland yet again overtake Scotland in terms of wealth.</p>
      <p sl="en">The figures are particularly damning for the government in relation to the north. After EU enlargement, the Highlands and Island are poorer even that parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Eastern Europe is now competing directly with Scotland for jobs and wealth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Scotland ought not to be so poor. The Irish don't have oil. The Finns don't have a world-class whisky industry. What they do have is the power to take charge of their own wealth. The key element lacking in the Scottish economy is the power to make real decisions – independence is the missing ingredient.</p>

      <p sl="es">High Representative. Mr President, I know that today’s sitting has been long and hard and I will therefore try to be brief; but there can be no question that the issue we are going to deal with is of extreme importance to the European Union and, therefore, while being brief, I will try to be as precise as possible in order to give you a picture of recent events in that region which is so close to our hearts and at the same time to give you an idea of how we can move forward together given the window of opportunity that has just opened up.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would be a mistake to believe that the European Union is not playing an extremely important role in that region. There are clear examples of this. There is a Member amongst you, Mr Rocard, who has headed the whole observer mission, and whom I would like to congratulate on my own behalf and I believe on behalf of all the Members of Parliament and, undoubtedly, on behalf of all the Palestinians and all the men and women of Israel, on the extraordinary work he and the people working with him have done during this extremely complicated election period in Palestine. Thank you very much, therefore, to our friend Michel Rocard, and I wish him the greatest of success in the work he still has before him.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can also tell you that I had the privilege, representing the European Union, of being the first person to have talks with the President-elect, Abu Mazen, and also with the Prime Minister, Abu Ala. I believe that the two meetings were fundamental in terms of trying to piece together the future of Palestine and finding the best possible way for we Europeans to contribute to resolving the historic problems which are undoubtedly closer to being resolved today.</p>
      <p sl="es">During the week I spent there, which I would like to describe to the honourable Members, I also had the opportunity to visit his Majesty the King of Jordan and his government, as well as President Mubarak and the people in Egypt who are handling the cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis with great determination.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of brevity, I would like to divide my speech into three parts: firstly, how I see the situation in Palestine; secondly, how I see it from Israel’s point of view; and, thirdly, how I believe we should move forward, from a European perspective, with a view to supporting the peace process, which I believe requires greater speed, momentum and determination.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, from the Palestinian point of view, I would like to demonstrate and share with you the mood of the citizens of Palestine on the day of the vote and subsequent days. If you will allow me, I would sum up the feeling I experienced over those days in Palestine, whether in Ramallah or in Gaza, in two words. The first word is pride: pride in having been able to handle a very difficult crisis very well; a crisis whose end, when it began, with the arrival of President Arafat in Paris, could not be predicted. They have done so extraordinarily well and with great maturity, and I believe that the international community and we Europeans must take good note of the capacity and skill of a society which, with pride, is able to do things well. And, as well as that sense of pride, there is a general sense of hope; a hope we must be capable of satisfying, and which we cannot allow to fade through lack of political action, whether on the part of Israel or on the part of the international community.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, the most difficult time we are going to have to face will undoubtedly be the time from now until July, August or perhaps September. During that period, certain very important events still have to take place. From the Palestinian point of view, the most important is perhaps the legislative elections. The presidential elections are sometimes perhaps the easiest; the legislative elections are going to be more complex, they are going to require more detailed preparation on our part, and, as you know, they are going to be carried out in accordance with an electoral law which has a majority component and also a proportional component. The different political formations throughout Palestinian political life will therefore have the opportunity to participate. It would be very significant for everybody, above all for us and for the Palestinian people, if those wanting the peace process, those wanting to make progress in the direction that President Abu Mazen made very clear during the election campaign, were to represent a majority.</p>
      <p sl="es">During the election campaign, President Abu Mazen said some very courageous things, which we have listened to and applauded: issues relating to the violent intifada, the peace process and his willingness to hold dialogue. In truth, we must acknowledge what President Abu Mazen has done, both during the election campaign and during his first days in office, as extraordinary. He had the courage to say the things he had to say and he said them well, and not only has he said them, but he has put his words into practice; he has begun to apply the measures that he said he was going to apply during the election campaign.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore absolutely essential, ladies and gentlemen, that the international community and the European Union support this process. Allow me to point out that this feeling which I would like to share with you not only exists amongst the hierarchy, in the Presidency or amongst the people who lead the Palestinian Authority at the moment. Civil society has the same feeling. I met in Ramallah with leaders from civil society and I saw that they felt and shared the same feelings, the feeling of hope and the feeling of pride, which is felt amongst businessmen and teachers, doctors and people who work in the administration. We, therefore, have the obligation to do what we can to maintain these feelings of pride and hope.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, in order to give you an idea of the situation persisting in the territories and the number of things that have to be done, please allow me to tell you a small anecdote from the meeting I held with a group of businesspeople, businesspeople who are working legitimately in Ramallah or Gaza and who are trying to contribute to economic development, in very difficult conditions. One of them said to me: ‘If I have to take a container of tomatoes, for example, from Ramallah to Gaza, it costs me twice as much as importing that same container from Hamburg (Germany) to Gaza, and takes half as long: two and a half weeks to take the container from Ramallah to Gaza, and practically a day or a day and a half from Hamburg to Gaza’. That is the economic situation also faced by those people who want to help in the economic re-establishment of the country. There is therefore a lot to do in all respects, from the political to the economic. And I hope this example will illustrate the current situation in the area to those honourable Members who have not been there.</p>
      <p sl="es">The situation in Gaza is much more serious, ladies and gentlemen. Very few people have been in Gaza recently; I spent the whole day in Gaza, meeting with political forces and with civil society, and, at a time when we are talking about disengagement, about a withdrawal from Gaza, we must bear in mind that Gaza is effectively an area which, if not completely destroyed, has certainly changed dramatically since the last time I was there six months ago. The situation is one of extreme poverty, very great destruction, whether one visits the northern part, the part adjoining Israel, the southern part, the so-called ‘Philadelphia Corridor’, or the capital city itself, the historic city of Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="es">So this is the situation we are in. But I said that the time between now and the summer is going to be very important. Why? Because of the legislative elections, as I said before, but also because the Palestinians themselves have decided to hold elections within the fundamental organisation, the organisation which is at the heart of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation; Fatah. There are also going to be elections in Fatah in the summer, which will undoubtedly mean a change in the Palestinian representative structures and undoubtedly a generational change as well within the Palestinian authorities themselves.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that these brief comments provide us with a view of the situation from the Palestinians’ point of view. If I wanted you to remember an expression, I would like it to be the one I used before: pride in what has been done and hope in relation to what still has to be done.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to move on to comment briefly on what I found in Israel having held talks with all the political leaders, from Prime Minister Sharon, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Defence Minister, the defence services and also with society itself. As you know, while the elections were taking place in Palestine, there was a change of government in Israel; a change of government which, as you know, was elected by the skin of its teeth; Prime Minister Sharon’s government won by a margin of just two votes. So, although in Palestinian and Israeli society the majority in favour of peace is gradually increasing, in the Knesset, the Parliament, there is still such a profound division that Prime Minister Sharon failed to secure the votes of fourteen members of the majority party, of his own party, Likud, and the new government had to be elected as a result of the votes of a separate and minority party, the party of Yosi Beilin, and with the abstention by two members of an Arab party, who abstained in order to help the government to win.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is the current situation of potential governmental instability in Israel. But the most important issue also facing us from the Israeli point of view is what we could call the abandonment of Gaza. We Europeans have stated the conditions in which we would support the withdrawal from Gaza, and in those conditions we will support it, and I believe that these conditions will come about more clearly in these circumstances. As you know, for some time our conditions have been that this process, which is known as the disengagement from Gaza, must be part of the final peace agreement we are all dreaming and thinking of and which must end in two States. The withdrawal from Gaza must not be the end of a process, but the beginning of a process which must lead to its final conclusion, which is to put an end to the occupation of the territories.</p>
      <p sl="es">From that point of view, it is very important that we know the timetable for that disengagement from Gaza. The timetable practically coincides with the Palestinian election timetable. What still has to be voted for – and we will see whether this is a success at the end of March – is the approval of the budget; we will have to see whether there is a sufficient majority for the budget to be approved in the Knesset and, if it is approved in the Knesset, the disengagement process, the withdrawal from Gaza, would take place at the end of August or the beginning of September. So, ladies and gentlemen, if we could superimpose maps illustrating the respective situations in Palestine and in Israel in terms of their respective timetables, we would see that the two timetables are practically the same. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing an extremely delicate and difficult situation, but one which, as I said earlier, is full of hope and good will on the part of the majority of political players who have to play a definitive role.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, we can see that, in order for this hope expressed by the Palestinians to be maintained, in order for this sense of pride to be maintained, it is absolutely essential that things begin to move, and that means action on the part of the Palestinians, and they have already taken action, and President Abu Mazen has taken very important decisions over recent days to try to put an end to the acts of violence which were preventing a resumption of negotiation and dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. As a result of the measures he has taken, today there has been the first meeting since those which were suspended, between the heads of the offices of Prime Minister Sharon and Minister Erekat, a meeting which, I have just been told, has been positive and which has offered a little hope of being able to resume contacts between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
      <p sl="es">If everything goes well, there will be a new Palestinian Government in two weeks time, Prime Minister Abu Ala has practically completed it, and there is an agreement between President Abu Mazen and Prime Minister Sharon to hold a first high-level meeting once the government is formed. That is also the position of our Israeli friends and they are prepared to maintain the current security situation. Thanks to the efforts of President Abu Mazen, therefore, it is possible that that meeting will take place and that a dialogue will begin between the two parties which will lead to a political perspective somewhat clearer than the one we have had so far.</p>
      <p sl="es">Why is it essential that there be a political perspective?</p>
      <p sl="es">Without a political perspective it will be very difficult for the citizens of Palestine to maintain their sense of hope and pride in what they have done, and for us to take advantage of it. There must, therefore, as I said previously, be a political perspective, which Israel’s leaders must offer.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe it is a window of hope that has opened up, nor a door of hope. I would go further: I believe a path of hope has opened up, an avenue of hope, and we must do everything possible to ensure that that path can be taken and that we can reach its end. And we all know what the destination is: the destination is two States, a viable, democratic Palestinian state which can live side-by-side with the State of Israel, so that there is not just peace between Israel and Palestine, but that it should also have an influence on the whole of the region. I can tell you that that is the dream of all the citizens of Palestine; I believe it is the dream of many citizens of Israel and it is certainly the dream of all the citizens of Europe, and in particular all those who have dedicated much of their lives to trying to find a definitive solution to this terrible problem, which does not only have consequences for those who suffer most directly, but also further afield.</p>
      <p sl="es">I like to say, and I would like to say once again, that certain countries see the problems of the Middle East as strategic problems. We do not see them as just strategic problems. We Europeans also see them as neighbourhood problems; what happens in the Middle East affects us and not just, as I have said, for strategic reasons, but also for reasons of proximity. The Middle East is in our neighbourhood, they are our neighbours, as well as our friends.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must therefore insist once again that we Europeans have a great responsibility. We have been working since the first day, both with the team of the Prime Minister Abu Ala and President Abu Mazen, and with the team of Prime Minister Sharon, in order to see how we can do the two things which I mentioned previously, which are fundamental: to change the situation on the ground and to try to provide a political perspective, which can only be to return as quickly as possible to the roadmap, which is what has been agreed by all of us, the international community, in order to make progress towards that dream.</p>
      <p sl="es">What can we do and what must we do? We must do at least three serious things, in cooperation with the other members of the international community wishing to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, to continue to cooperate as intensely as possible in the electoral process; I would insist, and I have already insisted, on the importance of the electoral process between now and the legislative elections and, subsequently, the elections within the Fatah organisation itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, to help from the point of view of security. As you know, we are already giving advice, support and assistance in the planning of Palestinian security forces from a European perspective, in close cooperation with a great country which is making a great effort, Egypt, so that they can mobilise and play their role in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, we have the obligation to provide economic assistance, and we have been doing so for many years, but we should perhaps now do so, if not in a more intense manner, then at least in a more determined manner, more focussed on the fundamental priorities of the moment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, my time is running out; I just wanted to leave you with these initial comments. I could spend hours telling you about the emotions and experiences of these few days of great experiences and political intensity. Time does not allow me to do so, but I would like to leave you with this feeling: the feeling that there is hope, that there is opportunity, that there is a will to work, and to work together, for them and for us, and a sense of responsibility and obligation to find a way to resolve this extremely serious problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we want to, we will be able to. They want to; we are going to help them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I share the analysis of our High Representative, Mr Solana. For me it is also a pleasure to address you for the first time in a debate on the Middle East, particularly because for the first time in many years it sounds a more cautiously optimistic note. So it is wonderful to be here and to share with you the Commission’s thoughts, which of course very much complement what Mr Solana said.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, there are very encouraging developments in the region. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Asselborn, has just visited Jerusalem and Gaza and he feels that both parties are moving forward, as Mr Solana has just outlined. Polls taken since the Palestinian elections also show that a growing majority of Palestinians and Israelis now support a peace process and a peaceful resolution to the conflict on the basis of the two-state solution. That, per se, is a very important and encouraging development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The presidential elections went very well. I am very grateful to and have a deep appreciation for Mr Michel Rocard, who has done a very good job under difficult circumstances, together with his team. I would also like to thank again the Election Observation Mission, along with Members of this Parliament who contributed to its success.</p>
      <p sl="en">The political outcome of the election gives us reason for hope. Palestinian voters showed their desire for peace and democracy and the elections have now become a stimulus for a more democratic development of the region at large. At the same time we have taken good note of the election report and we will work with the Palestinians to iron out shortcomings in the election process, particularly when it comes to the independence of the Central Election Commission. We believe this is very important in the light of the forthcoming parliamentary and municipal elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share with Mr Solana the view that Abu Mazen is a credible partner for peace and a capable interlocutor for Palestinian institution-building, including the reform of the security structures. He has already shown leadership in the last few days with the deployment of police in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the restructuring of the security services and, as was reported in the media on Monday, agreeing with Palestinian factions on a cessation of attacks on Israel. That all adds up to a very cautiously positive movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that the international community now acts quickly to support him. The Palestinian people are expecting tangible signs of progress: improving their social and economic situation, reconstituting respect for law and order, and progress on institution-building and reform. I can promise you that the European Commission will play its part.</p>
      <p sl="en">I owe a lot to my predecessor, Mr Patten, who held up the Palestinian flag at very difficult moments. I also thank those of you in Parliament who supported him. I will continue to do this and especially now, when it is even more important, because it is the right moment to do more. I hope we will also have a chance to step up our cooperation on various projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2004 we allocated approximately EUR 250 million, and we will provide a similar amount in 2005. We will look very carefully at where our money is being spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now have a new instrument, decided upon in December, in the form of the action plans under our Neighbourhood Policy. These contain political and also economic measures that will assist the peace process. They include trade facilitation, the promotion of good governance and respect for human rights, understanding and combating the devastating influence of incitement to hatred, the easing of access to and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law, and encouraging cooperation on very practical issues that we hope will lead to an improvement in living conditions – the environment, water, energy and transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also look to an improved political dialogue that will allow us to raise issues not only pertaining to the peace process but also to weapons of mass destruction. I shall be going to the region shortly and will take up these ideas with the Palestinians and the Israelis. Obviously, the parties themselves will have to do the main part of the work, in particular confidence-building. I can already see that there is a renewed willingness to do so. Israel can offer confidence-building measures, for instance on security cooperation, the release of prisoners, relaxing restrictions on movement, easing economic pressure, better enforcement of the rules of engagement and means of reducing the number of civilian causalities.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that the Palestinians must reciprocate or even anticipate actions on security issues. They must consolidate the intra-Palestinian ceasefire, address Israeli concerns that the ceasefire will not strengthen the extremists, collect illegal arms and close the tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many things to be done but the most important is that the European Union should be united in its wish and will – as Javier Solana said – to help both sides to go down this avenue towards a peace that is worthy of being called peace. For that, we also look to the visit of President Bush and his team to Brussels on 22 February, where the Middle East peace process will be at the top of our agenda. If we can at least take some small steps forward there, then we will have a chance to work together, in parallel with the Americans, on the broader Middle East issue, something we are both committed to.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you very much as well to the High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for their immense efforts in the quest for peace in the region. It is clear that many things are moving in terms of this complex equation between war and peace in Palestine: the satisfactory result of the elections in which the Union and Parliament participated – I would also like to mention the efforts of Mr Rocard and Mr McMillan-Scott and others – the fact that we must congratulate ourselves on the fact that support for terrorism in the region has dropped from 65% to 40% since June – and this figure must continue to fall – the need to consolidate a truce with the extremist organisations and the efforts being made by the new President of the Palestinian National Authority to achieve it, which has created a new climate of dialogue, and the gradual realisation by the Israeli Government that there must be a viable Palestinian state, and at the same time a withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of these conditions, Mr President, are promoting the new climate and I believe that the parties must take decisions, they must take risks in order to restore the process and they must resolve this kind of situation in some way by restoring the roadmap.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is now an essential premise and that is an end to violence. Violence is not the solution, violence is the problem, and the 4000 dead, the thousands of injured and the social, economic and also moral devastation of some parts of Palestine clearly demonstrate the results of this immense process of violence in the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner expressed it very clearly: unfortunately, the efforts of the parties will not be sufficient to consolidate this cessation of violence and the international community must be decisively committed. And in this regard, Mr President, the European Union must take a step in the right direction and must increase its efforts not only through its actions, but also by bringing together wills and forging consensus with the partners in the Quartet. In fact, the arrival of President Bush in Europe offers an excellent opportunity to involve the new administration in this peace process. Only through determination, only by supporting and consolidating the new Palestinian Authority, by supporting that administration, by restoring infrastructures and supporting security processes will we be able to make progress in this direction. Mr President, by keeping a firm hand on the rudder and not giving in to the scourge of terrorism, we will be able to restore the process, firstly, and then consolidate the fair and lasting peace that the region has been crying out for for almost a century.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian presidential elections were a real breath of fresh air, a hope that change can at last begin in the tormented Middle East after many years of darkness, particularly in view of the fact that they were held against a background of occupation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe has believed in this process more than anyone else and has supported it politically and economically. Europe has a visible and substantial presence, thanks to the work of the observation mission led by our fellow Member Mr Rocard, which supported the equally remarkable work done by the Palestinian Central Election Commission, with which Parliament’s delegation, chaired by Mr McMillan-Scott, also collaborated closely.</p>
      <p sl="it">The far-sighted decision by the Palestinian leadership to entrust the choice of President Arafat’s successor to a free and transparent election process won the support of an overwhelming majority in Palestinian society. Palestinians want democracy but they also want freedom. That is why they have put their trust in a leadership that can get them out of their current desperate situation. Their new leader, Mr Mahmoud Abbas, has already shown in his election campaign and especially in the measures that he is adopting that he is seriously committed both to the domestic front, through curbing violence and initiating essential reforms for Palestinian society, and to the attempt to restart the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is now the Israeli Government’s turn to show the same constructive willingness, first by putting the unilateral actions it has announced, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, back into the context of the roadmap negotiations, and by putting a stop to the settlements and to construction of the illegal wall, as well as any other pointless acts which are designed to intimidate the Palestinian population and have nothing to do with security.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since the elections, Europe has also gained greater credibility in its role, and perhaps it can use its influence on the United States, maybe taking the opportunity offered by President Bush’s visit, as the Commissioner mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="it">Additionally, it is important to ensure that our commitment continues, because after the presidential elections there will be municipal and administrative elections. I believe we should support the political operation that the Palestinian leadership intends to carry out, which is to bring the Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposition groups, which have resorted to terrorism, back into the institutional fold. We must support such action in view of the prospect of establishing the two States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The progress that has been made and our positive assessment of it must, however, give us cause to reflect on other crises in the Middle East. I am referring directly to Iraq, where the situation is decidedly different.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, I intend to speak in Dutch, as you will gather.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Israel, a new government coalition has taken office and presidential elections have been held in Palestine. Those elections came about with the active support and help of the international community and particularly of the European Union, which contributed with an extensive observation mission under the supervision of Mr Rocard. Those elections were held because Israel had the wisdom to let them proceed, albeit not always without difficulty. The circumstances in East Jerusalem and the closing of the border crossing with Egypt spring to mind. However, the elections were made possible, above all, thanks to the maturity of the Palestinian people who have demonstrated their devotion to democracy, their desire for good governance and proper jurisdiction and, most of all, their desire for peace.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should particularly like to pay tribute to the Palestinian women who have made a definite contribution to the successful conclusion of those elections. Were they perfect? No, they were not, but, even with their imperfections, they can be examples to the entire region, and the Palestinians are absolutely right to be proud of this. We know what the key players, being the Palestinian Authority and Israel, now need to do, and so do they, in fact. The bloodshed has to stop, and the violence has to end as an indispensable first step towards peace. President Abbas appears to be managing to dissuade the Palestinian armed movements from using violence, which is no small feat. We support him in this, and we encourage him to persevere. In Israel, the government was changed in order to carry out the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We call on the Israeli Government to do this, to stop building the wall and to stop resorting to irresponsible violence. The most pressing tasks for Israel and Palestine are to stop the violence, restore basic security and restore a sense of normality.</p>
      <p sl="nl">An exceptional window of opportunity has been opened in the Middle East. I, along with my entire group, would want nothing more than for that window to become an avenue of opportunity. The European Union and the United States should now, based on their complementary roles, within the quartet and according to the roadmap, ensure as a matter of great urgency that Israel and Palestine take the road towards peace. Mr High Representative and Commissioner, you can both play a decisive role in this. Things have rarely looked so promising. What we now need is action.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, let me start by expressing my appreciation for the energy, time and involvement which the High Representative has invested over the past few years in keeping the fire burning. The fire is a very small fire of hope. Hope that, despite all the setbacks, a solution can still be found in the Middle East, in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, because, let us be honest, we have, over the years, held many debates in this forum, adopted a host of resolutions full of good intentions, but, in all honesty, I think that there were many people, myself included, who considered this to be a lost cause for which a solution could never be found. It now looks as if this hopelessness has ended, or the end is in sight anyway.</p>
      <p sl="nl">President Arafat was succeeded by Mr Abbas, a president who is not only prepared to make sound pledges, but is also prepared to take courageous steps. The Sharon Government is made up of parties who all agree on one thing, namely withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. I realise that where the Middle East is concerned, over-optimism is always misplaced, because all it takes is one bomb attack for the momentum to be lost. Nevertheless, I think that the clearing of the Gaza Strip offers a unique opportunity, the best opportunity in years, to break the mood of cynicism and scepticism and finally to take a step forward. That does mean, however, that the role of the European Union must also change. The European Union must switch from fine, general statements to very concrete and specific aid in the clearing operations, in order to ensure that these run smoothly. What does that mean according to the European Parliament and also my group? Those clearing operations can only be carried out in consultation between Israel and the Palestinians in the presence of an international observation mission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What can the European Union do exactly, and what is it prepared to do? In a consultation with Foreign Affairs Ministers in November 2004, the High Representative repeated the Council’s decision from March 2004. The European Union supports the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, provided that five conditions are met. It must form part of the roadmap, it must be a step towards a two-state solution. So far, so good, I think, but Israel should not use the clearing of the Gaza Strip to create new settlements on the West Bank or to extend old settlements. The transfer must be done in consultation with the Palestinian Authority and Israel must help reconstruct the Gaza Strip. That is, of course, where the problems lie. Hence my question to the High Representative. Are, according to him, those conditions currently being met or is there a chance that they may be met in the short term? If not, what will the European Union do to ensure that those conditions are met and, if they are not met, what will the European Union do then? Will we walk away? I hope not but, if we are serious, then we must try to meet our own conditions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Okay, let us be optimistic, because a good dose of optimism is called for where this issue is concerned, and let us assume that the conditions are met. What concrete measures will the EU then take? Once again, we should now move away from fine statements and make way for concrete proposals. Will we, for example, help send an observation mission? This is included in all the plans, but will the EU take part in this? What exactly will we do together with the United States? Will we mediate? Is there a request from Israel, or one from the Palestinians? Will we fund the reconstruction? Not in general, but very specifically – if you visit the Gaza Strip, you know what is damaged and what should be restored – are there plans to that effect? Once again, Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, the clearing of the Gaza Strip offers a golden opportunity to move forward. If we miss this opportunity, if things go wrong in the Gaza Strip, then I fear that we may be picking up the pieces for a very long time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Solana especially on having been there immediately after the elections. I must say that I met many Palestinians who were delighted that he was there and extremely proud that he had stayed overnight in Ramallah.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to focus especially on tangible facts in my speech. The Palestinians have done their part, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said yesterday, and have clearly chosen peace, democracy and freedom. They have chosen Abu Mazen’s programme, which comes out clearly and decisively against the slide into military action, whether terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens or an armed struggle of the kind even envisaged by the Geneva Convention and considered to be legitimate, which I cannot agree with. They have thus chosen precisely a plan for reform, peace and democracy. I believe it is important to respond to any requests and to any change or shift in their position.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that the proposal for a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza should also be welcomed, provided that it really is a withdrawal and, above all, that it is carried out as part of the roadmap and part of the negotiations. I think that the Quartet needs to take the reins very firmly again to prevent what happened after the Oslo agreement from recurring. Then, the international community stood back and let two disparate, unequal parties build settlements and communities on the one hand and carry out extremist, terrorist attacks on the other. An international presence is therefore important.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, it is also useful to see what is actually happening. Apart from the elections and the prospect of withdrawal, another fundamental factor also needs to be taken into account: the concrete measures that the Sharon government has put into practice over the last two weeks. I shall confine myself to mentioning just a few of them.</p>
      <p sl="it">The citizens of East Jerusalem can no longer go to Ramallah, which means not only that their economic life has been destroyed but, even worse, that a piece of land – East Jerusalem – which we consider occupied, has been annexed. It is not therefore just a question of the annexation of Jerusalem, as a single, indivisible capital, but of the annexation of the citizens of East Jerusalem.</p>
      <p sl="it">The properties of Palestinians who live in Bethlehem, Bejallah and Ramallah and the properties of Palestinians in East Jerusalem are being confiscated. Carrying out such an operation now, when there is a peace plan, means emphasising the fact that even private properties belonging to Palestinian citizens who do not live in Jerusalem but in Bejallah are being confiscated. These are not just issues of secondary importance: they are issues that cause a shift in attitude even among those Palestinians who trust in the future and have found hope in the possibility of peace.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, there is the Gaza question. I was in Gaza during the elections. Rafah has been closed for 87 days. Thousands of innocent Palestinians, who are not even presumed to be terrorists, are blockaded within Gaza’s borders and sleep in the streets as they have run out of money. Even the Egyptian taxi drivers are distressed to see Palestinians reduced to nothing. In addition, there is the Israeli Defence Force’s proposal to destroy 3 000 houses to stop the tunnels.</p>
      <p sl="it">All things considered, therefore, it is important that we should press ahead with the roadmap and seize every chance for peace.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Parliament seems to be an enthusiastic supporter of the presidential elections in Palestine and of democracy in the Middle East. Does this mean that it will also be equally enthusiastic towards the coming elections in Iraq? The Iraqis are surely just as deserving of democracy as the Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="de">It will be interesting to see if President Abbas has the will or the ability to curtail the murderous activities of the various terrorist organisations in his domain. Since the European Parliament had 28 observers present at the elections, perhaps they will report what role, if any, was played by Hamas, Fatah and the other terrorist groups in the election.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has, I believe, spent EUR 17 million of taxpayers’ money on assistance to the Palestinian elections. What proof do we have that this money was properly spent and accounted for? What proof do we have that none of this money found its way into the pockets of terrorist organisations? The European Union has no legitimacy to play a part in the Palestinian – or any other state’s – elections, but if it is going to pour millions of euros into them, then we should at least know where they have gone.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is remarkable, is it not, that the late President Arafat – who was purportedly a lifelong and selfless champion of an impoverished people – seems nevertheless to have possessed enough part-time entrepreneurial skills to accumulate a multi-million dollar fortune. If only he had thought to remember the Palestinian people in his will to a sufficient extent, then the recent elections could have been staged by his generosity, rather than as a further burden on the European taxpayer.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the European Union insists on providing funding in the field of Middle Eastern politics, given its legendary levels of corruption we can at least ask that it receive and keep the receipts for its expenditure, contrary to practice to date!</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as observers of the elections in Palestine we can say that, to all intents and purposes, a proud young democracy is being born there.</p>
      <p sl="it">During our mission we saw that the people of Palestine have a strong desire for freedom and are looking forward to a return to normality and peace. Despite the violence of recent weeks, the presidential elections have indeed ushered in a new scenario in the Middle East and have set an example to the whole Arab world. For that very reason, the European Union must now take a central role and do all it can to support the peace process, first of all by relaunching the roadmap, which is still the starting point for resuming negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="it">In that respect, this morning’s news that talks between the Palestinian National Authority and Israel are reopening augurs well. The first major event in the new peace process will be the London Conference, to be held in March; security, the consolidation of democracy, and political, institutional and economic reforms in Palestine will be on the agenda. Europe will at last have an opportunity to exercise its authority in the peace process and also, I believe, to put forward an economic programme to foster development.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are surprised to hear it said sometimes that action of that kind would be premature and that the European Union would not be prepared to support it. On the contrary, this is precisely the time for the Union to take the political centre stage with concrete action to support the development of the Palestinian economy, by means of an EU-monitored programme characterised as a new Marshall Plan for Palestine, as was proposed by Italy the day after 11 September and recently put forward again by the United Kingdom. I also believe that that is the way for Palestine to escape from the poverty and marginalisation that all too often swell the ranks of fundamentalism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I make no secret of the fact that in the Middle East conflict my sympathies lie with Israel. I represent Northern Ireland, a state which itself knows all about terrorism, and I can readily empathise with a small country that, since its inception, has found itself subjected to sustained and vicious terrorist attack. That empathy is increased by the fraternal links, over many years, between the IRA and the PLO. The historical record shows that active cooperation between the PLO and the IRA resulted in funding and training being arranged for the IRA in Middle Eastern countries, and for years we had the spectacle of official PLO delegates attending Sinn Féin conferences. As purveyors of death and destruction, they had much in common.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as there must be no room for terrorism in Europe, so a prerequisite for political progress in the Middle East is an end to all terrorism. I therefore encourage Mr Sharon to be resolute in refusing to deal with active terrorist organisations. Drawing on Northern Ireland’s experience, I can tell him that pandering to terrorism never works: it only encourages its insatiable demands and breeds a political representation that is wedded to the muscle of terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="en">There is now a real hope for peace in the Middle East after the generally free and fair election which took place to elect a successor to Yasser Arafat. At Arafat’s funeral in Cairo, where I represented the European Parliament, intense discussion was already beginning about his successor and the opportunity for a new start. I congratulate Mr Solana for his active engagement in the region since that funeral and until today, and I urge him to continue it.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the presidential election, the European Parliament sent its largest ever election observation mission. There were 28 Members of the European Parliament, chaired by myself, with Mrs Napoletano as deputy chairman, and we arrived in Jerusalem a few days before the election. I wish to thank all colleagues on that mission – many of whom are here tonight, Parliament’s staff for their outstanding support, and the interpreters. Our delegation met the two principal candidates – Mahmoud Abbas and Mustafa Barghouti – as well as the chairman of the Electoral Commission and Mr Rocard, who will be speaking shortly.</p>
      <p sl="en">As chairman I laid a wreath at Arafat’s tomb in the Muqata. I also met smaller political parties contesting the elections and, in a completely private capacity, other Palestinian groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament delegation was consistently met with enthusiasm and confidence in the role that the European Union could play in furthering the democratic process. The Palestinians’ aspiration for EU support was clear, with the European Union flag everywhere. Now we must look to the future and support the Palestinians in their preparations for the legislative elections and their reform of the electoral law.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, my main message tonight is that the presidential election was a model for the rest of the Arab world, where no democracy exists. Mahatma Gandhi once said, ‘the spirit of democracy cannot be imposed from without’. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, however, said yesterday to the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly, ‘we can encourage democracy, and we will’. I wholeheartedly support this view and believe that in this, the tenth anniversary year of the Barcelona Process, it is time for the European Union decisively to raise its game in the wider Middle East. After all, this is our neighbourhood, not the Americans’.</p>

    <intervention id="3-090" speaker_id="1977" name="Rocard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, I should like to thank you for your excellent introductory remarks and for all of the congratulations that you have addressed to me. I was proud to do this work and one of the things that I can say about it is that we were extremely well received by both sides. Europe was most welcome, even from Israel’s point of view, I must say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I run over time, I shall miss my train; I shall therefore be brief and I should be grateful if you could forgive my rudeness because I do not have the time to listen to your responses. All I can do in the rather ridiculous amount of time that we have for debates is to point out the crucial points that should continue to be the focus of your attention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the forthcoming elections in Palestine will be considerably less straightforward than the previous ones, in which there was effectively only one candidate, no real battle for power and no Hamas candidate. This time it will be different, both for the municipal and for the legislative elections. The elections will be fiercely contested. I hope that the Palestinians can be persuaded to abandon the use of the civil identity register and that the municipal elections are monitored as closely as the subsequent legislative elections; this is important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some have said, I understand, that this is a window of opportunity and a ray of hope. The main element of that ray of hope is based on the undeniable quality and depth of the Palestinian people’s democratic will. My friend Mr McMillan-Scott said this straightaway. He is right – this is a choice to pursue peace, as well as a choice to pursue democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are less sure about the other side. Mr Sharon’s decision to pull out of Gaza is to be applauded, but I should like to draw the House’s attention to the fact that, from our point of view and that of the roadmap, there is no link in Prime Minister Sharon’s rhetoric between Gaza and the rest, and he offers no guarantee that, after Gaza, he is considering the West Bank and Jerusalem. This is an absolutely key issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns the eradication of terrorism. There is much that we can do. Mr Sharon is right to set demands, Mahmoud Abbas is right to set about doing this and is doing so with courage. He is sociologically under an occupying foreign force, so it is impossible to eradicate terrorism completely. I feel that Mr Sharon, an experienced general, knows what he is talking about; he knows that by demanding an end to all terrorism before any talks can resume, he is asking the impossible so that he can be sure of not getting it. Perhaps he needs to be told that terrorism will be eradicated from Palestine when, as one people, the Palestinians will be able to hope for a different life. This will involve the economy, opening the borders, trade, work, creativity and a political perspective. These are the conditions, and I feel that it is our duty, as well as that of the international community, to remind him.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to point out that, until now, nothing has contradicted the tragic analysis made by an eminent Israeli academic in a book that you know well, High Representative, because I lent it to you. According to this academic, Mr Sharon respects the Palestinians, does not want them to die of hunger, but is engaged in demolishing any collective identity and, in his heart, rejects the idea of a State. We should take this analysis further in our speeches and our work, in order to put pressure on him.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My last message is that I do not believe that either in Israel or in Palestine will a political authority have the legitimacy to convince people of the need to sacrifice certain symbols for peace, be it Jerusalem or the right of return, while the religious authorities themselves fail to preach peace and the sharing of those symbols based on consensus. Without that, we shall achieve nothing. Please tell them that from us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I also had the honour of accompanying the European Parliament's mission to that region and to witness what the High Representative described very well as a mix of pride and hope, which was actually reflected in the faces – in the souls even – and the words of everybody we saw. I would add that one could also see an expression of patriotism.</p>
      <p sl="es">The people who were voting and those in control of the voting process were truly expressing a sovereignty which, in some cases, contained a degree of genuine civil resistance, in the style of Gandhi. Voting was a way of saying, ‘This is ours, this is our territory and our future is here, but we shall live here in peace through the ballot box’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Their message contained all of that and there is, therefore, huge cause for hope, but we are well aware that if frustration comes, it is always directly proportional to the hope which preceded it. The responsibility, therefore, of all of us in Europe, and the European Union itself, who have contributed to generating this hope, is now immense, even greater, in fact, than it was before the elections.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Solana, you have described the situation very well – and so has Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – but you have described it very specifically and have pointed out certain guidelines. You mentioned what the European Union could do for Palestine. I will not add anything to what Mr Rocard said with regard to the elections, because I believe he is absolutely right: security and economy. I would like to talk a little more about what the European Union expects from Israel within the framework of that disengagement, that withdrawal from Gaza which, if it takes place in a strictly unilateral fashion, without any coordination or any negotiated and agreed process, may not be good or at least may have certain counter-productive affects.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I believe that the European Union has the responsibility – as other speakers have said – to prioritise introducing this issue into the restoration of transatlantic dialogue. The Transatlantic Agenda is going to be reviewed in two days time. The European Union must make this issue an absolute priority. In that way, the European Union can make a spectacular contribution to this peace process.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr Solana, I would like to congratulate you on your warm and tireless commitment to peace. This is one of the visible expressions of the positive Europeanism of all the European citizens with regard to this work towards peace in the Middle East. The ball is now in Israel's court. We have a Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who is taking a stand against violence, not just through words but through actions, and who, furthermore, has the legitimacy of having been elected democratically.</p>
      <p sl="es">Israel cannot remain passive in this situation. Israel must respond to Mahmoud Abbas with concrete measures. It is not just necessary for the European Union to call for a truce and the disarmament of the Palestinian activists, but it must also urge Israel to put an end to its policy of selective assassinations and immediately halt the construction of the wall in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the ‘Quartet’ must take measures to remove controls and allow the Palestinians access to employment and trade. After many years of conflict, it is clear that the Palestinian and Israeli societies are suffering great fatigue, weariness and sadness, which may paradoxically offer a glimmer of hope at this point. But Israel must respond to this glimmer of hope. A first step towards reopening the path of negotiation would be a negotiated withdrawal from Gaza, verified by an international mission organised by the European Union within the framework of the ‘Quartet’.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe, furthermore, that one of the problems is that we cannot begin with a step-by-step approach, we cannot say what Mr Bush said: ‘We will have a Palestinian state in 2005’. We are in 2005 according to the roadmap and now Mr Bush says that we will have a Palestinian state in 2009. We must reduce the time between the beginning and the end. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people are mature enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel. According to the opinion polls, the two peoples are in favour of a political pact in order to achieve a definitive status similar to the Geneva Agreement. Furthermore, this definitive status, of a permanent nature, is very similar to the agreement almost reached by the two parties in Taba at the end of 2000.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is a fact and I believe that the European Union must take this opportunity to put pressure on Israel to respond to this stance of the new Palestinian leadership.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, the general impression which we gained from our experience as election observers is that the Palestinians managed beyond any doubt, and this is perhaps the first time such a thing has been possible under conditions of occupation, to hold democratic and free elections. This event constitutes a major political act, which sends political messages both to Israel and to the entire international community. On 9 January, the Palestinian people sent a clear message of dignity, of absolute attachment to democracy, peace and the fight for independence. The elections were held freely and democratically, with increased participation by women and young people, and for that they deserve congratulations. The problems, which related mainly to East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, were caused for two reasons: one reason was the stand of the Israeli authorities and the other reason was the – in our opinion – poor arrangement agreed between the Palestinians, the Israelis and the European Union in the 1996 agreement whereby, out of 120 000 voters, only 6 000 voted, sending their ballot paper via the Israeli post office, while the rest would have had to travel to other areas of the West Bank in the midst, moreover, of conflicting information. Nonetheless, the day after the election opens new prospects for the resumption of the peace process. The winner has declared and clearly expressed his intention to continue with a demilitarised, peaceful resolution of the problem based on international law, the UN resolutions and the roadmap. The new President, with the contacts which he had recently with the armed organisations, must have managed, we believe, to persuade them to proceed with a unilateral ceasefire, an action which we hope will lead to a truce which will break the vicious circle of violence and will be very helpful to the resumption of the peace process. He also appears to be prepared for a series of internal reforms aimed at economic, social and political development, despite the unfortunate circumstances which exist by reason of the occupation. At the same time, however, with the efforts which the Palestinian President has started to make in order to get the peace process restarted, signs of good intentions will also be needed on the part of the Israeli Government. Unfortunately, the construction of the wall, which was so roundly condemned by the international community, including in an opinion by the International Court, is still continuing, as are the settlements. On the basis of the roadmap, 2005 would be the year of the declaration of an independent Palestinian State. Nonetheless, 2005 is here, without any such prospect in sight. We, as the European Union and as the European Parliament in particular, have a very important role to play in efforts to resume talks and find a definitive solution to the problem. Over and above the theoretical level via resolutions and so on, we also need to find a more practical way of lobbying in all directions for material talks which will result during 2005 in significant progress and in a quick definitive solution to the problem, a solution which cannot but include the foundation of an independent Palestinian State in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and, of course, the destruction of the wall and an end to the occupation, so that the two nations can build a peaceful future which will contribute to peace and progress for the entire, long-suffering area of the Middle East as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, allow me once again, on behalf of my group, to assure the Palestinian people and the forces of peace in Israel that they will find in us supporters of their efforts for peace and a resolution to the problem.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, today, fifty-seven years after the event, we are being given a golden opportunity to correct a mistake which cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. If, in 1948, when we gave shelter – a state – to Israel, we had done the same for the Palestinians, many people would have been saved; the wars which killed so many thirty to thirty-five years ago would probably not have taken place. The attack on 11 September might also not have taken place, if we accept the public explanation of the accessory to the event, Bin Laden. The death of Iphigenia brought a favourable wind for Agamemnon. The death of Arafat (sometime terrorist, sometime negotiator, sometime Noble peace prize winner, whatever served the status quo at the time) and also the death of Sharon's monocracy in Israel may perhaps bring the favourable wind of peace. If we do not act effectively and immediately, this golden opportunity will be lost. Terrorism will escalate, both state terrorism, which is cruder, but also the terrorism of independent marksmen. The United States appears to be changing course; it wants to leave, to turn away from the Middle East and go towards Russia, with everything that implies. We, however, live in the area, we shelter 40 million Arabs, we here in this place failed to give Jews the chance to live through the Nazi occupation. We must grab the opportunity now.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are free, or nearly free, elections and others that are not, such as the forthcoming elections in Iraq. Once again, the European Union is pandering to the interests of the United States, as well as funding ill-advised operations to interfere in another country’s affairs.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the same way that attempts are being made to impose a European constitution on taxpayers without their having a say, funds are being siphoned off to maintain the shameful, pointless occupation of Iraq. The European Union is sailing blind through the stormy seas of this occupation, while the hulking flagship of the allied invaders is sinking and taking with it those countries in the Union that have not been able to remain independent of the heinous geopolitics of the United States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The overwhelming majority of Iraqis, who see the occupying forces as the reason for the fall in living standards since the downfall of Saddam Hussein’s regime, will not take part in sham elections which the official propaganda, with media complicity, depicts as a crucial opportunity for a transition to democracy. The intention is to pass off the US attempt to survive their obvious attrition, at least politically, as significant elections that will lay the foundations for the new Iraqi State.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a disgrace to commit human resources to supporting and thus politically validating the elections in Iraq. We will be legitimising a puppet administration and passing it off as a democracy, thus continuing our complicity with the invasion of Iraq, the grounds for which have been shown to be utterly false. The invasion has been followed not just by brutality but also by countless verified episodes of corruption, waste, inflated accounting and fraud, to the detriment of the administration itself.</p>
      <p sl="it">All this is more than enough for me to call on Parliament, on behalf of all Europeans, to dissociate itself from any legitimisation of the elections in Iraq, thus sparing us all the dishonour of being politically and morally complicit in that colossal political and media fraud.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, I would like to focus on the Middle East and make just a few comments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The election of Abu Mazen and the manner in which it was accomplished; the formation in Israel of a new coalition government with voter support across party lines; a new American President, embarking on a term in which he sees no need to make himself re-electable: all these factors, I think, make for a scenario that has been almost unknown in the Middle East in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Abu Mazen’s deployment of his police and his negotiations with radical groups have made it apparent that he is in a position to impose conditions that President Arafat always rejected and of which he was not capable. I see this as a reason why we now really have to make use of this particular situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, and you in particular, Mr Solana, to ensure that the Quartet should now become more than just an institution in which papers are drafted and dialogue carried on, and, with all the clout at their individual and joint disposal, should intervene in order to tell the Middle East that this is not just any old agenda, but is backed up by the entire commitment of the whole international community; as a demonstration of our desire for a solution and, at the same time, in order to show the parties that we can guarantee their security and development.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of the Quartet’s members has the credibility in the eyes of both sides to manage all this on its own. Only if they act together will such a security framework have sufficient credibility to be capable of being accepted, so that, at one and the same time, Israel can be safe behind secure borders, and Palestine an economically viable state.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the hope that progress may be achieved, let me make a final comment. On both sides, people want peace and rapprochement. We now have to help put together a coalition of moderates on both sides and prevent the radicals – who are a minority – from again preventing a settlement. This is in our interest, and we should therefore give it priority.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Solana, I was in the Rafah refugee camps in Gaza at the time of the elections, and I thank you for your highly opportune words. Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for your commitment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like, if I may, to take you back to the Iraqi elections and to express my concern. These elections are scheduled for Sunday and form part of Bush’s political exit strategy, legitimised by UN Resolution No 446. The plan was to hand back self-determination to the Iraqi people, yet since it has been in place, tensions have continued to rise. The occupying forces have been unable to transform themselves into peace-keeping forces and the appalling behaviour at Abu Ghraib prison was indicative of this. Attempts to recreate Iraqi forces, especially a police force, have been punctuated by attacks targeted against those who, unfortunately, are sometimes deemed collaborators with the enemy power. This is a failure. It is those same Iraqi forces, supported in the background by the US forces, which will be looking after the polling stations. Sunni extremists are boycotting these elections and the increase in Shiite fundamentalist movements, whose arrival Iran is viewing most favourably, gives rise to fear of a theocracy in place of a new democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The holding of these elections is completely bizarre. Not one condition has been fulfilled that would give legitimacy to the winner and bring peace; far from it. The feeling is that there will be further violence. It is therefore hard to believe that a constitution will emerge free from Sharia, one that respects women’s rights, unless a firm grip is kept on the writers’ pens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The timetable for 2005 is incredible: a constitution on 15 August, a referendum on 15 October, legislative elections on 15 December and a new government on 31 December. What does the Council make of this headlong rush? Do you believe it is feasible? Should we in fact believe it is feasible, Mr Solana? Is there a European strategy on this issue? I would hope so, to preclude the possibility of occasional rhetoric that may be close to mine but with which I do not agree. I feel that we must not keep silent about these elections; such silence would be a sign of ambivalence and that is not something I would want.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Many thanks, Mr President. Members of this House have repeatedly expressed their hope that not only will the peace process in Palestine be resumed, but that recent events in the country will amount to the start of democracy building, and of building what may be the first democracy in Arab countries. Of course, building this democracy will not be the simplest of tasks. We are all aware of the scale of the country’s problems, for example the widespread corruption. It is common knowledge that democracy must not consist merely of civilian control over law-enforcement agencies, such as the police and the secret service. In order for democracy to be meaningful, the authorities’ actions, and most importantly the budget, must also be transparent. The reason I say this is that the European Union is providing significant amounts of financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, and will of course continue to do so. It is important for these funds to be accounted for, so that we know how they have been spent. It is, however, equally important that the entire budget of the Palestinian Authority, including those items funded from sources other than the European Union, should be entirely visible and clear for everyone. This would ensure that in future it would be impossible to accuse the Palestinian Authority of something it is still frequently accused of, namely funding the actions of terrorist groups that are in no way conducive to peace activities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second point I should like to make is that we would all like this process to culminate not only in peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, but for this peace to become a genuine peace throughout the whole region, and not the kind of peace that existed in Europe during the years of the Warsaw Pact and the Cold War. We should therefore start to consider certain methods for building trust that we have already tried out in Europe, with extremely satisfactory results. I thank you.</p>

Work to extend the erection of the wall of shame and confiscate the property of Palestinians expelled from East Jerusalem has resumed, despite the fact that the pretext which the Israeli Government put forward in the past about its Palestinian counterpart's alleged lack of conciliatoriness has crumbled.</p>

Even in the resolution, the so-called terrorism of the Palestinians is ranked as the first issue. A new slanderous campaign is under way to connect the Palestinians with Iran and Syria as an axis of evil and source of terrorism, in order to justify the intransigence of the Israeli Government and prepare public opinion to accept the new imperialist interventions and wars being planned with the aggressive plan for the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is obvious that, even in today's debate, an endeavour has been made, in an unacceptable manner, to connect a European party which belongs to the European Parliament, Sinn Féin, with terrorism.

      <p sl="en">The Palestinian elections represent a light at the end of the tunnel. The work done by the EU was very good. The representation of women was very good. Second place for Mustafa Barghouti is a democratic dream. Nevertheless, cautious optimism must be our stand. We should offer an opportunity to Mahmoud Abbas to conciliate security forces, to come up with legislative and economic reform. We should strengthen the position of the Quartet, instead of confusing it with the Geneva initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also be aware of the very sensitive situation in Israel. We should, today of all days, recognise the right of Israeli people to self-defence, the right of mothers and fathers to secure the lives of their children by that unfortunate security measure, the security wall.

      <p sl="it">The key to stability and economic growth in the region lies in a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The deadlock in recent years has prevented the European Union from making its influence felt, unfortunately confirming the US diplomatic joke of ‘we play you pay’, meaning ‘we have political power and you pick up the bill’.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have been through a terrible year: in the United States we saw the election year make George Bush focus entirely on the war in Iraq; in Israel the Sharon government shut the door on negotiations; and in Palestine Yasser Arafat’s personal and political troubles paralysed the National Authority.</p>
      <p sl="it">That impasse cost dear in terms of human lives, misery and despair. Many of us wondered whether there was still room for hope and whether any dialogue was possible. Today, as Mr Solana has explained, a window of opportunity has opened which we must make use of. The United States has a President in his second term of office who can devote himself to the Israeli-Palestinian question with some room for manoeuvre. The new Israeli Government, with figures like Shimon Peres, is choosing dialogue. In Palestine we are pleased to have helped in and witnessed the first presidential election, won by Mahmoud Abbas, who now enjoys strong popular and international legitimacy.

As an election observer, I was delighted to see the enthusiasm by civil society, including women, to participate in this experiment, unique in the Arab world. In spite of calls by Hamas for a boycott, even that organisation, afraid of being frozen out of the political process, is now talking of taking part in the parliamentary elections. Abu Mazen now has a strong mandate to negotiate with Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was disappointed at the low turnout in East Jerusalem and the fear of Palestinians resident there that they would lose their Israeli IDs if they voted. I was unhappy at the refusal of many polling-station officials to cooperate in releasing turnout figures and the size of the electoral list. There was some confusion between domestic and international observers, which must be sorted out before the parliamentary elections in July.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank the IDF for its cooperation at checkpoints. After the temporary setback caused by the tragic death of six Israelis in Gaza, President Abbas is now making a vigorous attempt to rein in the terrorists by deploying his security forces to the Gaza border. I call upon Prime Minister Sharon to recognise this by restoring diplomatic contacts with the Palestinian Authority and putting the roadmap for peace back on the political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that a comprehensive peace plan through territorial exchange, which consolidates the security of the Jewish State, is possible. I also believe the security fence has proven its value in reducing suicide-bomber attacks, does not reflect the final borders of the Israeli State and can be moved or dismantled when a peace treaty is finally signed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent polls in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza support the Geneva Accords as one such peace model. Why not a simultaneous official plebiscite by both sides to reinforce mutual recognition of the two-state solution?</p>

The impact of this continuing conflict has adversely affected neighbouring populations in the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf, North Africa, and has reached as far as Europe and the USA. The conflict has resulted in injuries and deaths for thousands; poverty and distress for millions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The persistent attention and the combined strengths of the whole of the United Nations, including the European Union, has brought little or no relief for the population of both opponents. Quarrels of this intensity, that stretch back to the roots of nations’ histories, have only one key that can open the door to peace. Money will not do it, although it can ease the pain of continued poverty. Power is hopeless in moving the minds of man. Outsiders can only suggest: without force they cannot take the executive decisions required. The fundamental change from violence to peaceful solutions; the move from the use of weapons of war to dialogue as a means of reaching acceptable answers; there is only one thing that will tilt the balance, and that is the will of the people. Once that is secured and is allowed by the men of violence to be expressed, democracy is the only formula for complete success.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today the Palestinians have spoken, their voice has been expressed peacefully through the ballot box. The result is that the Union’s twenty-one year search for the two-state solution is now within reach. If this is good for Palestine, why should we deny democracy to the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula and beyond? I have high hopes for the coming election in Iraq, and elections that may happen later on in other states of the world where violence and non-peaceful solutions are used. This spread of democracy is the European Union’s task now. It is one in which we can join hands with our American allies.

The Palestinian people now have a legitimate President and a valid interlocutor to negotiate peace with Israel. President Abbas needs to be given both the time and encouragement to consolidate his position and to implement his electoral programme, that is, firstly to end the armed Intafada and prioritise the political process, and secondly, to proceed to the necessary internal institutional and – in particular – security reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The news of recent days indicates that there are already some positive effects on the ground. The deployment of Palestinian policemen in northern Gaza and the reported progress in talks with the armed factions have led to four days of calm followed possibly by a ceasefire. Given the precarious nature of such ceasefires, it will be helpful that substantial gestures – such as the lifting of the restrictions of movement, the freezing of settlement activity, the halting of the construction of the separation wall and extra-judicial killings – will go a long way towards creating the favourable context of this window of opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision by the EU to send such a large mission to assist and observe the election, and to nominate as its head an eminent member of this Parliament, was commendable, as it made our presence felt both locally and internationally. Great efforts on the EU’s behalf are now needed within the context of the Quartet, to encourage both sides to capitalise on the developments in the interests of peace.

Indeed, contrary to expectations, the elections in Palestine went well and the new leader has stated his intention to resume peace negotiations with Israel, to curb the extremists and to reform the corrupt aspects of Palestinian domestic affairs. That may be too ambitious a programme, but it does show a willingness to change. Israel, for its part, opened talks with the new government, but they have stalled because of an unexpected spiral of violence that has frozen relations.</p>

Things must not stop now. The Union’s role is to act as guarantor of a plan for a permanent solution and in the meantime to provide both peoples with a firm basis of help with a view to change. It is time for Europe to accept its responsibilities towards the Middle East, as our own security is also directly threatened by that interminable conflict. A solution to it can only be found by negotiating a sound, permanent peace agreement such as that envisaged in the roadmap.</p>
      <p sl="it">The international community ought to help to create a Palestinian State, but at the same time it must help to solve the problems of borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem, water resources and security. As Shimon Peres once said, the hope is that after the time of hatred there will come a time of sharing, because the two peoples will have to divide a small tract of land between them; they will have to grow up together in mutual respect and learn to share.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who were present at this election, on a day which started with the transparent ballot boxes being meticulously sealed at seven in the morning and continued with everything being conducted with a great deal of pride and precision, can well imagine what that all meant for the Palestinian people themselves, in terms firstly, of course, of their relations with Israel, and secondly of their relations with the Arab world, for they gave a demonstration of something that is wholly unknown there. That is what made this election so significant, and the desire for peace was tangible; people have had enough of conflict, and Hamas and its call for a boycott were ignored.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that all those – and there were some of them in this House – who have constantly been telling us that it was Arafat who guaranteed peace and that when he was no longer there, the situation would descend into chaos, misjudged the situation. The people of Palestine were much more astute than some of the European analysts of the situation thought they would be, and that is why there are such great hopes riding on what is happening there now.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is something I would ask both Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner to raise in their talks. According to press reports, Mr Sharon told our High Representative that withdrawal from Gaza had been agreed on in talks with the authorities of the Palestinian Autonomous Territories; if that is indeed the case and it proves possible to hand it over in an orderly manner, then we, and the UNHCR, should give some thought to using that as an opportunity to convert the refugee camps into permanent dwellings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our working party on the United Nations was joined this morning by Mr Hansen, from the UNHCR. He described how, after the destruction of the camp in Jenin, the decision was taken to build proper houses, so that the people would at last, after 50 years, no longer be refugees. I see Gaza as offering a second opportunity to get the refugees out of their camps and into permanent settlements, once the handover has been properly accomplished. I therefore ask that this idea be considered in talks with UNRWA and with the authorities concerned, in order that this situation may come to an end and a new era may begin.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, at this point in the debate, I simply wanted to add an anecdote involving a scene I witnessed together with Mrs Lucas. It was in Hebron. It was dark. There was a power cut as a result of an accidental failure of some generators. Two young Palestinian policemen immediately took position to prevent any possible attempted fraud in the darkness. There was similar a reaction at the tables nearby, demonstrating truly exemplary spontaneous civic maturity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regardless of the serious problems faced by a people, if that people protects its ballot boxes and its electoral prestige, it is a wonderful people that believes in democracy. Once the lights were back on, it occurred to me that the road to the dream of peace, described to us this evening by Mr Solana so precisely and with such moral and political authority, may well have opened up.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, a lot of attention deserves to be given over the next few months to the situation in the Middle East. Sunday’s election in Iraq will be exciting – a perhaps historic opportunity for a nascent democracy. I should like to say thank you to Mr Solana and the Commissioner for their constructive and perceptive contributions. It is good to hear such commitment expressed. The election in Palestine and the new government in Israel offer new hope. Ariel Sharon must, however, help Mahmoud Abbas be successful, for otherwise there is no way forward in the process.</p>
      <p sl="da">I was myself on an observation visit to the West Bank in November and saw with my own eyes how terrible and desperate the situation is there, especially for the many Palestinians who at present live below the poverty line and under incredibly difficult conditions because of the Israeli occupation. It is a poverty created not by natural disasters or such like but by the Israeli occupation. Israel’s right to hunt down terrorists must of course be recognised, and the Palestinians must also do everything they can to bring the violence to an end. Israel’s right to hunt down terrorists does not, however, mean that every possible means has to be used. The illegal executions, the house demolitions and the excessive use of power in relation to civilians is unacceptable. The illegally erected security wall also constitutes a special problem because it has been predominantly erected on Palestinian land and makes it impossible for the Palestinians to cultivate the land in these areas. Jerusalem, where Palestinians are separated not from Israelis but from each other, is also a special problem. The major expropriation of land, combined with the settlements policy, makes it difficult to see how a sustainable Palestinian State might be established. It is particularly worrying to see how a double infrastructure is in the process of being developed on the West Bank. The facts on the ground show that the occupation now has more to do with creating secure conditions for the many settlers than with creating security for Israeli citizens living in Israel.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU must demand of Israel that it cease developing settlements on the West Bank and stop constructing the security wall. Otherwise, the opportunity for a two-state solution will have been missed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the main item today is Palestine, but I want to turn our attention back to Iraq. Palestine is in the middle of a chain of extremely remarkable events, including elections in Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq. Therefore, Sunday’s forthcoming challenge is not a single event, but part of a set of very significant changes that have been going on recently in the most wounded part of the Islamic world. We do not have to blame it, as some used to, or welcome the possible boycott, but welcome and expect the firm stance and good turnout at the polls by the Iraqi people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was impressed some time ago by reports from Afghanistan about millions of women going eagerly and resolutely with a feeling of human dignity to vote for the first time in their lives and in the history of their country. Now it may happen in Iraq and that is to be blessed by God, who is common to Christians and Muslims. Hopefully it will happen there, despite the efforts of non-divine forces. Whatever the case may be, one can be absolutely sure that under Saddam Hussein or after a victory for terrorists, it could never happen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East requires special attention. The Israelis are living in a very difficult situation, as they have to cope with the constant risk of terrorist attacks, while the Palestinians are living in a thoroughly unacceptable situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Anyone like me who has recently been an observer during the elections for the Palestinian President has had first-hand experience of a reality that seems incredible if viewed according to ordinary rules and criteria. I must confirm, by the way, that the elections went impeccably, despite the local situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the Palestinian world, people live without any points of reference, without any certainties, in a social situation of total decay in environmental, employment and organisational terms. In the Israeli world, people live in a constant search for a means of defence. Aid and support come in from many places but, so far at least, they have not led to any tangible results. I believe we need to know what resources the Union has committed to the area in recent years, with what aims and under whose responsibility. I also think it appropriate that future investments should be aimed at improving the quality of life in the Palestinian lands.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, it is not enough to make donations, but we also need to check how the money is being spent. In that respect, I await an answer from you to a specific question of mine. I believe that a real commitment for the future, together with the political commitment to facilitate negotiations between the two States, which will also be aided by the new Palestinian Presidency, may perhaps in future produce an outcome which would certainly have been quite unimaginable prior to the current state of affairs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a matter of general agreement in this House that we want to get back on track and make progress towards achieving a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now that a Palestinian President has been elected and there has been a cabinet reshuffle in Israel, expectations are high, both here in Europe and among the people in Israel and Palestine. From talks outside the official programme in Ramallah, and from observation of the elections to the west of it, I got the impression that, while people are of course suffering from the occupation, they do not have a good word to say for the way things used to be run by their own people, for Arafat’s inability and unwillingness to do all that was needed to create within the Palestinian Autonomous Authority effective structures for the security forces and health care, among other things, are no secret to anyone.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is our task to ensure that the Quartet join together in accompanying whatever happens now, which may be withdrawal from Gaza. I want to see the EU, the USA and the other stakeholders joining together in dealing with both sides. I do not think that this sort of ‘one after the other diplomacy’ gives the parties concerned the right impression, so let them see the whole Quartet present there and hear it speaking with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your task, Mr Solana, is to make a start right now on planning for what happens – by which I mean planning how we will deal with the parties – after withdrawal from Gaza, so that things can really progress from that point on. If not, this conflict really will become a never-ending story.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, today we are debating, for the umpteenth time in the European Parliament, the long-term human tragedy experienced by the people of Palestine and the people of Israel. We truly face a new chance for a substantive peace process; the new situation following the Palestinian presidential elections advocates the appraisal that the preconditions for a chance for peace, stability and security in a long-suffering area are in place. A return to the negotiating table is more than imperative. Reactivation of the roadmap for peace is also imperative. It is precisely the strengthening of the validity of the roadmap that will allow a stable and final peace agreement to be negotiated.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to emphasise in particular the need to reinforce the special role of the Quartet. It is a role which should reflect the elements of cohesion, of clarity of objective and of decisiveness. I should also like to point out that Mr Solana's practical proposals concerning security, reforms and financial aid are a move in the right direction. They are an indispensable European contribution towards efforts to establish framework terms for strengthening both political and economic security.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our central aim, which the European Council laid down in December, is clear: an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State, which will coexist peacefully and within a framework of security with Israel and the neighbouring states. However, it is not enough that we alone want it. Above all, the protagonists in the dispute must themselves want it.</p>

      <p sl="es">High Representative. Thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you very much to all the very honourable Members who have been kind enough to stay with us until the end of this long sitting on a key issue, a fundamental issue, which perhaps deserves more attention from Parliament given the times we are living through. I would like to say that all the Members who have spoken have spoken with sincerity, with a strength and a hope which I believe represent the spirit not just of the European Parliament, but also of the majority, and hopefully all, of the citizens of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that today, from this point of view, has been a day of emotion, a day to allow our emotions and values to emerge, for us to express ourselves physically and verbally. I would like to say that the time has come from now on for these sittings to begin in a real sense to pursue an objective. We should not just allow our emotions to outweigh our thoughts, but we should begin to show signs of where we want to go and how we want to move forward. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that following the historic times – and they should be described as historic – we have experienced, the European Union should implement a clear action programme, as we are doing and as we are explaining to Parliament. And the final results of the programme should be the creation of two States and most importantly the Palestinian state, which is the one that does not yet exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">And I believe that we cannot go on talking and talking unless we ensure that we are gradually taking the steps necessary to make that a reality within a useful period of time. I would like to say that, from the point of view of our Palestinian friends, what they have now is not a State, but rather a situation prior to a State, which I would like to call a pre-State, and what we have to do is help them in the most effective way possible to make the reforms necessary for them to have a State which is viable and not a State that fails, but one that is consolidated. To that end, there is no question that we must help them to reform and adapt their own structure. Having a pre-State with the limited responsibilities of a pre-State is not the same as taking on all the responsibilities of a State, which do not just include issues relating to the economy. Here I would like to speak in defence of the Commission, of Parliament and of the European Union as a whole. The way in which the European Union spends money and the way in which Mr Fayyad, who is in charge of finance for the Palestinian Authority, spends money, is exemplary.</p>
      <p sl="es">And I would like the Members of this Parliament to see this and for the citizens of Europe to know it too. The efforts of Mr Fayyad, who is in charge of finance, together with the efforts that the Commission and all of you and the whole of the European Community have made, are extraordinary and exemplary and I would like to see many other countries, with much more history, who are not pre-States like the Palestinians, having the same capacity to manage their money and doing so in the way they do.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, there is no question that being a State does not just mean having economic structures, it also means having security structures and today there is no State, but rather a pre-State, and we must therefore help them so that when they do have a State, they have solid security structures. The European Union has the mechanisms to do this and is already doing so. It is helping to build and consolidate the security forces as effectively as possible, so that they can be of service to their citizens, to peace amongst those citizens and therefore to the law and order that all States must have.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, in a State there are elections and there will be elections between now and the summer. Please allow me to stop in the summer, from then on we will see what happens. From now until the summer there are very important elections, which we must assist, which we must help to pay for and which we must continue to promote so that they may be proper and positive.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, from the Palestinian point of view, what the President is doing at the moment with a view to achieving a cease-fire, with a view to achieving an agreement on dialogue amongst the Palestinians, is extraordinary. Many of us would not have thought it possible to achieve this in such a short space of time. It has been done and it must be maintained. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware that the situation is very fragile. When the elections took place, days later, the first meeting between Sharon and President Abu Mazen was planned, but as a result of violence, all possibility of dialogue broke down: the situation is fragile, and while we have been talking here, there has been another attack, and we are therefore well aware that, whatever happens, we cannot allow the people of violence to hold the key to the future of the process. It would be absurd and it would be unjust. The violence must be stopped, but we cannot allow the people of violence to hold the key to moving the process forward. And I must point out that, as somebody said to me, we must ask Israel for many many things. And there is one very specific thing which they can do and must do: the withdrawal from Gaza, which at one point was intended to be a unilateral decision, can no longer be a unilateral decision. It must be an agreed decision and a decision that represents an initial step on a path that should lead to a withdrawal from the occupied territories. That is what we must call for and that is a part of the fundamental policy we Europeans must implement.</p>
      <p sl="es">I honestly believe, after the long week I have spent in Israel as well, as I have said, talking to all of its leaders, that this is not impossible, that it is possible, and we must fulfil our responsibilities as well. I would ask you to use your imaginations, I cannot ask you all to go to Gaza, but the situation in Gaza for those who have seen it and know what I am saying, is dramatic and that disengagement from Gaza cannot be allowed to turn it into a prison. It must have the capacity to trade with the outside, it must have a port and it must have an airport, otherwise the people in Gaza will never be able to leave. And we must therefore help and we must help to ensure that there is a port and an airport and that port and that airport must undoubtedly be subject to international authority and we should be prepared to accept that responsibility if it falls to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must be able to face that responsibility. I therefore believe that all these issues are fundamental and that, in order to achieve results, we must focus on them during our debates. The time has come to achieve results. We do not have an infinite amount of time before us; if we have too much time we will be frustrated, we will frustrate the Palestinians, we will frustrate the Israelis and this moment of hope which you have all recognised, this moment of pride which also exists amongst Israelis and Palestinians, will pass. There must be a community which begins to think in the same way in both Israel and Palestine, and that community must not be broken and should recover the spirits which existed before, at the time of Oslo and just before and after Oslo.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is what must be done, therefore. And there is one thing I would also like to say, to Parliament and to my Israeli friends: you must stop making any decision that goes against any possible final agreements. This is very important, it is very simple to say but very difficult to do. But no decision should be made which cannot be reversed when the time comes to take decisions on the final agreements and some decisions being taken at the moment are going to hinder or even prevent what many believe those agreements should contain: the fundamental parameters of the final status.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is something we had to say in a friendly way, and at this time when Israel is commemorating very sad times, very bitter times for which we Europeans should take great responsibility, with the friendship and principles which should be at the hearts of we Europeans, who are so responsible for so many things, we should say it as friends, as I have said, so that they really listen to us, because what we are saying moves in the direction of peace and not in the opposite direction. That is what I wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, and I would like to thank those of you have stayed with us until this hour, on my own behalf, and I hope also on behalf of my good friend the Commissioner Benita Ferrero, whom I would like to thank for being here with us.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a lot of work ahead of us and we need the help of everybody. This is not going to be easy, it is going to be very difficult, but we must win this battle for peace, not just for Israel and Palestine, but, as many people have said, for regional peace. If there is peace in Israel and in Palestine, there will be more possibility of regional peace, and I would have much to say in response to what you have said about Iraq, but I do not believe that this is a day for mixing up the two different debates. Sunday comes in four or five days time, there will be other debates on Iraq, but let us be in no doubt that that evolution will come about.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore come to my final comment: over recent years we have seen Israel and Palestine in what we could describe as a situation of crisis management. From now on we must return to politics, to politics with a capital P, and achieve results, since we will then have clear objectives, and if we have clear objectives and the political will to achieve them, we will achieve them. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry about the time and thank you to all the honourable Members for being with us throughout this very long day. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like Javier Solana, the Commission and I are committed to trying to make these steps happen, knowing how difficult it is and given all the support. That means of course that we are also committed to making the first concrete steps and I would like to mention a few of them because it has been requested.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, we have just agreed for instance to make an additional EUR 20 million available for Gaza. We are also working very closely with the World Bank. Just last week I met with President Wolfensohn. We take the advice of the World Bank very seriously: unless there is an end to violence and to movements of goods and people, any additional money will have little impact. Therefore it is very important to achieve improvements on this side.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will also discuss these issues very concretely with the Palestinians and with the Israelis when I go there on 7 and 8 February. I also want to see what we can plan and whether there are good projects that we can implement in order to help this process really get under way, whether it is on reconstruction or institution-building, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say to Mr Laschet, we are also supporting efforts to improve the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees, to provide better housing and a change of the refugee status. This will require a negotiated solution as is foreseen in the roadmap; this is more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that it is crucial that we do not lose sight of the political process. Javier Solana has just outlined this. We also have to ask ourselves what will happen the day after the Gaza disengagement. Parties need to engage on a political process that goes beyond Gaza. This is a key issue that we also have to discuss with President Bush and with Condoleeza Rice when they come to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much, this has been a very engaging and interesting discussion. You can see we are all committed to this process, but I will also add a note of caution: it is a difficult process and it can erupt at any moment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us discussing a resolution on a day that weighs heavily upon us, the day of remembrance to be held in Auschwitz tomorrow, recalling a crime that is associated with that place and unique in human history. Today’s debate, then, must be conducted with all the restraint that befits it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not only am I a Member of the European Parliament and Chairman of a multinational group within it, but I am also a representative from the Federal Republic of Germany and a German; speaking as I do this evening in this capacity – by which I mean both my role and my nationality – on the subject of Auschwitz and a resolution on the Holocaust, I am, of course, also speaking as a citizen of Germany, a nation and country with which Auschwitz is inseparably linked.</p>
      <p sl="de">Auschwitz represents the moral nadir in my country’s history. The concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was built by Germans, by criminals with whom I share a nationality, by people who defiled my country’s honour in a way unequalled by anyone before or since. For that reason, a German can never be completely objective when speaking about this subject. Every generation – my own included – inherits what its predecessors left behind them. Auschwitz is part of the heritage with which we modern Germans have had to live.</p>
      <p sl="de">So it is not only in my capacity as Chairman of this group that I affirm that we Germans have a particular responsibility when it comes to combating anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, fascism, contempt for humanity, terrorism and murder.</p>
      <p sl="de">Like many other Members of this House, I will be able, tomorrow, and as Chairman of my group, to be able to join Mr Borrell at the ceremony of remembrance at Auschwitz, at which the President of the Federal Republic of Germany will also be present. That it is possible, 60 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, for Germans to join there with others in remembering that event, that it is possible for a German to go there as chairman of a multinational parliamentary group and, together with his counterparts from other countries – Russia, Poland, Israel, France and Italy, among many others – to spend time there in reflection, to remember the victims and thus to restore to them a little of their dignity, is something that we owe to the European Union. It is the European Union that has made it possible for us Germans to return, with heads held high, to the democratic family of peoples, in which we, the Germans of today, make our contribution to democracy, to human dignity and to the fight against racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, my group endorses this resolution, and those of us who are German – I believe this to be true of all the other groups as well – stand by what it says.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as the honourable Member Mr Schultz has mentioned, a large number of Heads of State, representatives from this Parliament and other parliaments will gather tomorrow in Auschwitz, along with survivors of that hell, to commemorate the liberation of the extermination camp sixty years ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As representatives of a new Europe, they are fulfilling the duty to remember and to pass on the message, which is today more necessary than ever. The Presidency thanks the two Members for providing us with a moment of reflection and recollection through this question, here in Parliament, which, in 1979, following its first direct elections, elected an Auschwitz survivor, Mrs Simone Veil, as its President, and I pay tribute to her for her courage as President of this House.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sixty years – that is less than the life of a human being. This is an opportunity to give a voice to those people, the few survivors, who carry the scars of that incalculable horror, which is unspeakable and yet must be spoken about loudly and clearly today. The Shoah will always remain a break, a fracture, in European history, as you so rightly said. Furthermore, as the former Bundestag President, Mrs Rita Süssmuth, said, the Shoah has no parallel. We appreciate that 20th century history is pockmarked with genocides, but the nature of the Shoah is specific and unique. It is the very negation of our civilisation, of our spiritual and ethical values, the negation of the humanism that Europe created.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Auschwitz does not solely belong to history, a history that is unsustainable. Auschwitz must remain a living, painful reality, which will encourage current and future generations to gain a better understanding, to reject any ideology based on hate and exclusion, and to put the notion of ‘never again’ into practice on a daily basis. The obligation to remember, essential though it may be, is not enough. Of course we need to remind ourselves about what happened, but there must also be commitment and action. Anti-Semitism has not gone away. According to the Vienna monitoring centre, anti-Semitism is in fact on the rise in our societies, along with racism of all kinds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The revisionists and the deniers, all those who try to water down the unique nature of the Shoah, all those who put forward pretexts in establishing unacceptable links must be combated. This is a crime against the truth, to borrow the phrase coined by President Chirac, and those responsible must be hunted down in a Europe based on ethical values and respect for human rights; a Europe based henceforth on the Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporated into the Constitution and resoundingly adopted by Parliament. It is also a crime against the memory of all of those who suffered, in particular the tens, hundreds of thousands of children whose lives were destroyed in the most abject way, children whose sad stares we have seen in photographs. Let their terrified stares remain etched on our consciences and exhort us to pursue a determined and committed fight against forgetting and, worse, against complete denial of the crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the defence of human rights – starting with all those who have been subjected to attacks on their dignity as part of the current wave of anti-Semitism and racism – is one of the cornerstones of European Union policy. To this end, the Council and the other institutions are working closely with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations in the fight against what is a genuine scourge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council has welcomed the initiatives taken by the OSCE, such as the adoption of the Berlin and Brussels declarations condemning all manifestations of anti-Semitism and all other acts of intolerance. During the ministerial-level meeting of the OSCE in Sofia, the posts of personal OSCE representatives for combating anti-Semitism, racism and islamophobia were created. This should help to reinforce the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which is the OSCE’s office in Warsaw responsible for monitoring instances of anti-Semitism and other examples of intolerance. During the 59th session of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution explicitly condemning all forms of anti-Semitism was adopted on the initiative of the EU. In New York, on Human Rights Day, 10 December 2004, the Union pointed out the importance of education, an essential prerequisite to fostering the emergence of a culture of respect and tolerance that is consistent with safeguarding fundamental rights. The creation of a European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia is in line with the desire on the part of the Council, and the Union as a whole, to have at its disposal the tools needed to combat the various forms of intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have indeed read the paragraph on history books and the teaching of history that must be promoted at European level, and memory work with young people is a European initiative that must be supported, and the Presidency will ensure that this happens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is fully aware that the fight against racism and xenophobia is not over when faced with a resurgence of anti-Semitism, xenophobia and openly racist events. This resurgence is a source of great concern for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">On numerous occasions the Union’s institutions have reaffirmed their commitment to defending human rights and have condemned all forms of intolerance, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, which are direct violations of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. These are the principles upon which the European Union is founded and which are common to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is tackling racism, xenophobia, racial and religious discrimination across a wide range of programmes and initiatives, from anti-discrimination, justice and human rights policies to education and research programmes. The Commission intends to continue and to reinforce its efforts in the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. In particular, the Commission has repeatedly called on the Member States and the Council to adopt the framework decision on the fight against racism and xenophobia, which it proposed in November 2001. This proposal would require Member States to ensure that racist and xenophobic behaviour can be punished, and that there would be approximately the same criminal penalties across the EU. This proposal would also improve judicial cooperation between Member States, thus making it easier to bring the perpetrators to justice. In the Commission’s view, the adoption of this text would offer Europe the legal framework it needs to fight efficiently against the scourge of racism and anti-Semitism. We hope, in full agreement with the Luxembourg presidency, to resume talks on this proposal in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has recently launched its annual call for proposals for the commemoration of victims of concentration camps. This initiative is aimed at raising awareness, particularly among the younger generation, of the atrocities that were carried out in these camps.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, members of the Council, over 50 years ago, the thought of peace for the people of a continent wrecked by two world wars was the one thing motivating the founding fathers of this European Union of ours – men such as Schuman, Monnet and Adenauer, and I wish they could be present in this House at this moment today, when Members from 25 Member States remember those liberated 60 years ago from the German Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Today, we commemorate all the Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Poles and people of other nationalities who were murdered there and in other camps.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking here today as a German Member of this House, I am well aware of the deeds committed by Germans in the name of my people over 60 years ago. I face up to the responsibility that devolves upon my people and my generation as a result of them. Our joining together today to remember the suffering, our joining together in calling for remembrance – not only of the concentration and extermination camps, but also of the crimes committed in them – that alone can serve as a warning to future generations that genocide has its roots in contempt for others, in hatred, anti-Semitism, racism and totalitarianism.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, the representatives of the citizens of this united European Union, are united in condemning every kind of intolerance and incitement to racial hatred, particularly all anti-Semitic acts and manifestations and all acts of violence motivated by hatred or intolerance for other religions or races. We likewise condemn attacks on religious sites, places and shrines belonging to Jews, Christians, Muslims or other faith communities, as well as all acts of violence committed against minorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of us, then, must work to promote cooperation and dialogue between the various groups in society, boldly and publicly denouncing intolerance, discrimination and racism. Neither today nor in the future must we forget our history or seek to shut the door on it. Our founding fathers faced up to the history that was theirs and is ours. They met together as a small band, with the aim of creating a Europe that would be peaceful, free, democratic and secure. Today it is for us, in greater numbers, to continue the work on this responsible task. Let us show ourselves worthy of it, capable of enabling this continent to grow through the twenty-first century in peace and diversity; for and with those who live now and will live in the future, and remembering those who did not live to see a peaceful Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today and tomorrow Parliament marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. In this House there has been some controversy regarding geography and the nationality of those responsible. The key players were German Nazis with their racial ideology that saw the Jews as an evil, inferior race that should be exterminated, on the basis of their deeply flawed and distorted eugenics. There are those, unfortunately, who espouse this sickening ideology still among us today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The German Nazis were aided and abetted by those of all races and nations who actively colluded in this extermination and by those who said nothing and allowed evil to flourish. Yet no nation in Europe was entirely innocent or entirely guilty. In Britain only the Channel Islands were occupied by the Nazis, but Britons in authority there registered the Channel Islands’ Jews, stamped ‘J’ on their passports and arranged all too efficiently for their transport to Auschwitz, where without exception they were murdered. All this was after the British Government of the time refused some of the same Jews the right to flee for their lives to the UK mainland because they were considered enemy aliens. We also had the British Free Corps of dupes, deserters and fascists who fought alongside the Nazis on the Eastern Front.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this debate is not primarily about the past. It is about the future. Earlier this week I attended an event organised in London by the Anne Frank Trust, where 50 survivors of the Holocaust gave their testimonies. They were not demanding more and better history, they were not arguing about the nationality or the geography of their captors and their guards. Instead they were joined by survivors of Kosovo and Rwanda to demand ‘never again’. Unfortunately, the forgetting has started. A fellow MEP, Mr Le Pen, recently stated that the Nazi occupation of France was not particularly inhumane, despite the murder of 73 000 Jews in the Struthof concentration camp in France.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prince Harry – hopefully – illustrated his woeful ignorance of history by finding it amusing to attend a fancy-dress party as a Nazi officer. The best memorial we can give here today, and in the vote tomorrow, is to reinforce the fight against anti-Semitism and racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia. The Commission, Commissioner Frattini in particular, and the Council should look at how they can best push forward the welcome framework directive against racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to consider the need for new legislation against race-hate crime and whether action should be taken at a European level to deal with the public display of Nazi insignia. We have been told on many occasions of the merits of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism, Xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Perhaps we need to look again at downgrading that monitoring centre by making it a much more general human rights observatory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we should look at how we can educate at European level the younger generation about the horrors of the Nazi extermination of the Jewish race, about the Roma, the mentally ill and the Christian Democrat and Liberal, Socialist and Communist anti-fascists who died in the concentration camps.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I pay tribute to Simone Veil, former Liberal Group Leader and President of this Parliament. I am glad that it was at the initiative of the EU that the UN General Assembly this week for the first time commemorated the Holocaust. My colleague Mr Geremek was there representing Poland, and, as he said, it was the Auschwitz camp built by Hitler’s Germany in occupied Poland that came to symbolise Nazi crimes. Those who forget their own history are condemned to repeat it; we have an urgent need to confront anti-Semitism and racial and religious prejudice 60 years on.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must learn lessons from the Holocaust: the way Nazism took hold, the insidious appeal of its ideology, the co-option of many apparently respectable people. If we understand the way Hitler persuaded 20th-century Germans to sign up to his evil doctrines, to scapegoat, despise and dehumanise Jews, Roma, Eastern Europeans, homosexuals and others, then we will be better placed to combat those in 21st-century Europe who desecrate Jewish graves or beat up Jewish people, who run Roma out of town, who paint graffiti on mosques, or who just resent foreigners or immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">We pay homage to all the victims of the Holocaust. There is no hierarchy of suffering, but if you permit I will just mention that as well as the genocide of the Jews, that of the Roma deserves full recognition.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not to diminish German responsibility to say that Nazism was and is a virus – anyone can catch it. The uncle of Queen Elizabeth II got a dose of it and her grandson was silly and uninformed enough to wear a fancy-dress costume complete with swastika to a party – apparently he was meant to be Rommel. Prince Harry’s ignorance was shocking; sadly, however, he is far from unique. That is why Holocaust education is essential in all school curricula. Most young British pupils have never heard of the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="de">I appreciate the reasons for the ban on the swastika in Germany but I am not persuaded that an extension of it across the EU would be effective. It would be far better to revive the stalled discussions on an EU law making incitement to racial and religious hatred a criminal offence. The substance – not the symbols – of racism must be our primary target. The Luxembourg Justice Minister gave a commitment to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last week that he would restore this matter to the Council’s agenda. We will hold him to that. I believe we would have public opinion behind us. In the UK, six out of ten people support such a law.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am glad we have the support of six groups for our resolution. All Europeans must be united in eradicating anti-Semitism and racism with determination.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, it would be highly appropriate for the presidency to suggest to all governments that January 27 be made European Holocaust Memorial Day across the whole EU; it is already in some Member States, but not all. A written declaration in this Parliament five years ago made that suggestion, which is also supported by the World Jewish Congress. I would ask the presidency to stress that point in meetings with colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes this resolution and hopes that it will be adopted by an overwhelming majority of this House, thereby sending the right message at the right time.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be seen as a call to action by every democratically minded person that there are those – both in Europe and elsewhere – who, even after 60 years, seek to minimise the barbaric acts committed under National Socialism or even to deny that they took place. It must goad us that people can draw up a party platform that involves classifying people according to their origin, religion, political tendency or sexual orientation, and still manage to get themselves elected. Even this House, alas, has not been without those who defend this approach, and so it is right and proper that it should take up a clear position and should unconditionally condemn all intolerance, all incitement of racial hatred and anti-Semitism in whatever shape or form. Again and again, we must nip these things in the bud.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us, together, press for educational material for young people, exchange programmes and visits to memorials to the victims of the Holocaust to become mandatory elements in the curricula of schools and universities. Perhaps the young people will be able to break down the walls in the minds of their grandparents, who are obviously unable to do this for themselves. Let us also discuss together how we may counter nationalist tendencies within this House. I would like to know for how much longer we will have to tolerate in silence these national flags, which are a deliberate expression of anti-European sentiment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to bring to your attention something that happened last week, something that I find unacceptable and which affects me, for it happened in my own country. I refer to the behaviour of members of the parliament of the German Land of Saxony who belong to the National Democratic Party. These gentlemen, whom I regard as wolves in sheep’s clothing, refused to take part in a minute’s silence for the victims of Nazism. Even worse, they mocked the victims by accusing the Allies of being mass murderers, justifying this by reference to the air raids on Dresden in 1945, which they described as a ‘bomb holocaust’. That is a disgrace, and not just for Saxony or Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think this shows that both Saxony and Germany need a clear signal from Europe to the effect that such thinking is intolerable and deserves to be outlawed. Our Group therefore welcomes in particular the Council Presidency’s declared intention to restart the discussions on a framework resolution on combating racism and xenophobia – which had run into the sand – and to press for a Europe-wide ban on incitement to hatred.</p>
      <p sl="de">I rejoiced to hear what you, Commissioner Frattini, and you, Mr Schmit, had to say, as you are evidently determined to make progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">If people are to be allowed to carry on making inflammatory speeches, they must not be given a safe platform under cover of indemnity. That is intolerable. I ask that we send a message tomorrow by observing a minute’s silence. I presume that the Bureau has made arrangements for one, but I regret that I cannot find it in the agenda.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, mercy was buried, the supreme values of humankind were buried and God died behind that iron gate. The symbols of Nazi savagery and the evil frenzy of persecution came to a head in the death camps and the most heinous crime in the history of the twentieth century was perpetrated there. Auschwitz represents both time and space, the geography and history of terror, murderous barbarity and homicidal madness, a cold-blooded torment of hatred beating down on the homeland of the Enlightenment and Positivism, in a Europe that had taken leave of its senses.</p>
      <p sl="it">The madness of the concentration camps was generated by a ruthless rationality, a perverse idea of a world that had to eliminate critical cultures, make standardisation prevail and see diversity as the arch enemy. The Memorial Day cannot be a mere commemoration; it cannot confine itself to being a rhetorical remembrance of a monstrous event; it cannot just be summed up in the image of that soldier who discovered the horrors of Auschwitz. On that day the first stone was laid in building a Europe of peace, a political entity that should have destroyed the word ‘war’, roots and all.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go in a Europe that has yet to speak out clearly and decisively against war and which is often struck dumb, while the man of our times is, in the words of a great poet, ‘still the one with the stone and the sling’; he continues to kill through exact science geared towards mass destruction. Remembrance is not enough, but we must use the same energy and unceasing determination to take a stand against the violent impulses of anti-Semitism, racism and Islamophobia. We must put up effective, official barriers to the spread of gender, sexual and ethnic discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="it">The whole world as well as Europe is criss-crossed by contagious germs, which spread together with ideas about preventive and permanent war, in other words the dogma of the clash of civilisations and the new crusades against the infidels. Auschwitz is not just a place buried in the memory of the historiography of Nazism; Auschwitz is also fear and terror about what the future will bring.</p>

Polish flags will hang here for as long as they hang above the President of the European Parliament, in accordance with European law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">No one can ever be in any doubt that the Holocaust, which was an unprecedented crime, should be condemned. On behalf of the Polish Members of this House, however, I should like to stress that our reaction to Parliament’s joint resolution on the Auschwitz concentration camp does not seem to have been properly understood by the Western media and public. There are therefore a few facts that I should like to draw to your attention.</p>
      <p sl="pl">References to so-called Polish concentration camps, such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek and Sobibor, have regularly appeared in the European press, and especially the English-language press, for many years. This is a hideous distortion of history, as the references ought to be to German concentration camps on German-occupied Polish territory, and not to Polish concentration camps. I should like to cite one single example that should make this clear. In France, 50 km from Strasbourg, the Germans built the Struthof concentration camp near the town of Schirmeck. This has never been referred to as the French concentration camp named Studtoff. It has always been called a German concentration camp on French territory. No one in their right mind would call the camp at Guantanamo a Cuban camp. The phrase used by Mr Schulz in the original version of the resolution, and I quote; ‘the Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland’, came very close to suggesting that it might have been a Polish concentration camp. Our indignation and anger should therefore come as no surprise to you, given that such false portrayals of history are knowingly being presented.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, the joint compromise resolution refers only to Hitler’s Nazis as perpetrators. We would note at this point that Hitler was democratically elected by the vast majority of Germans. National Socialism was not forced on the Germans …</p>

      <p sl="it">UEN Group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is worrying to note that, despite the immense tragedy that affected the Jewish world and consequently the whole of humankind during the last century, there are still outbreaks of racist and anti-Semitic feeling spreading across Europe and elsewhere. In recent years, we have even seen prejudiced stances against Israel here in Parliament, which have certainly not helped either to achieve peace in the Middle East or to demonstrate that Europe is more able or prepared to make a common stand against terrorism and violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Knowledge of the massacres and tragedies that humankind has seen in recent history and the fight to prevent crimes of a similar nature from being repeated represent one of the founding values of the European Union, which was created from the awareness that peace, democracy and respect for others are principles that cannot be taken for granted but, instead, need to be strongly reaffirmed every day.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that the presidents of the political groups in the European Parliament were present at the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz – to which I paid tribute in 1999 together with the current Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Fini – takes on a special significance today because it represents the unity and will of the people of Europe not only to condemn the Holocaust but also to continue to fight the injustice, violence and discrimination that still exist in Europe and throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nonetheless, while reaffirming our condemnation of the past tragedy, we must show our concern at the news of anti-Semitic demonstrations in Russia and several countries in Europe. Those who still do not understand the need for an out-and-out commitment to combat anything that openly or surreptitiously justifies or even fails to condemn acts of intolerance, racism and anti-Semitism do not realise how ignorant they are of history or that they are creating for themselves an abyss from which there is no return.</p>

We could have expected a text that pays tribute to the victims of the Holocaust with, in all serenity, an appeal never to forget this gruesome chapter in European history so that this can never be repeated. My party, the Vlaams Belang, could obviously have agreed to a resolution to that effect, together with 99% of the MEPs, but the resolution that is here before us for discussion has not been conceived in that spirit. The horrors of the Second World War have all been disgracefully piled onto one heap along with, and I quote, the rise of extremist and xenophobic parties and growing public acceptance of their views. Paragraph 5 of the resolution literally calls for the current fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism to be set against the background of the Shoah in education.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My party, the Vlaams Belang, is neither extremist nor xenophobic, but the standard politically correct terminology is very much against the current democratic political parties that make a stand for maintaining national identity. The traditional political groups simply want to demonise a number of successful and growing competitors at the expense of the Holocaust victims. This is not only an insult to millions of voters in Europe but, what is worse, these cheap political games trivialise the horrors of totalitarian regimes, including National Socialism. Another worrying aspect is the appeal for, and I quote, a ban on incitement to racial and religious hatred throughout the EU whilst guaranteeing legitimate free speech. According to the traditional groups, there is apparently such a thing as illegitimate free speech which must be stopped at all costs. They seem to forget that freedom of speech only exists if it also applies to political opponents. Aberrations of this kind come as no surprise, given the fact that this resolution was submitted by the Communist group.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp was liberated 60 years ago. Auschwitz was not the only death camp built by Hitler’s Third Reich on Polish territory it had conquered and occupied, but it was the largest death factory in human history. One and a half million people were exterminated in Auschwitz on an industrial scale, using mechanical means. One hundred and fifty thousand Poles were deported to Auschwitz, half of whom were killed. Fifteen thousand Russian prisoners of war were also killed in Auschwitz, and Czech, Belarussian, French, Slovenian, Ukrainian, Latvian, Dutch and even Chinese people died there. The prisoners even included 2000 Germans. The Roma were destined to a certain death, with 20 000 of them killed. The overwhelming majority of victims, however, were Jews, one million of whom were killed in Auschwitz. This figure included elderly people, young people, women and children. The sheer horror of the Holocaust lies not only in the enormous scale of the crime, but in the fact that all Jews, irrespective of who they were, what they believed, what they did or what country they came from – and even those who had not yet been born – were condemned to extermination by Hitler and the German Nazis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fact that the House has acknowledged how important it is to remember this crime is of great significance. Sixty years have passed since the liberation of Auschwitz. This is not just an arbitrary date, as ever fewer witnesses remain with us. Living memory is ending, and history is beginning. The duty to tell the whole truth about this tragedy rests with those of us who are alive, and who were fortunate enough to be born at a later date. We owe this to the millions who were exterminated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The founding act of the International Education Centre about Auschwitz and the Holocaust will be read out tomorrow before the gates of Auschwitz. The Centre has been set up on the initiative of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, with the support of the International Auschwitz Council, whose director, Władysław Bartoszewski, was himself a prisoner in Auschwitz. He has said that, and I quote: ‘Soon our burden will be taken over by historians, scholars and teachers. This is why we turn to them and ask them to share the memory of the victims of Auschwitz and the Holocaust, to deepen understanding of the mechanisms of hatred and contempt, and to promote dialogue and cooperation to prevent such mechanisms from coming into play’. We politicians have a particular duty to ensure that we do not interpret historical facts to suit individual political interests. Even if there are noble motives for doing so, forgetting or distorting history will not help us to build lasting understanding or peace. The sturdiest foundation for the reconciliation of nations is humility before the historical truth, as this is the only way in which forgiveness can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We cannot change the tragic nature of history, but it can at least act as a warning to the rest of the world. I respect the comments made today by Mr Schulz. Nonetheless, given that the Polish Members of this House and the European People’s Party support the adoption of a joint resolution tomorrow by this House, I would ask you, Mr Schulz, to agree to adopt a different position, so that you yourself and your party can vote in favour of what we originally wanted, namely a clear statement to the effect that the Nazis were German Nazis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the most notorious of the concentration camps set up by Hitler, Auschwitz, officially opened on 14 June 1940. It was intended at that time for Polish political prisoners whom the Nazis wished to treat with particular severity. At the head of the camp was a former common criminal who, in 1946, would boast of having exterminated three million people. As from 1942, he would send up to 6 000 victims per day to the gas chambers, mainly Jews from all corners of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As soon as they arrived, those who were too weak to work were picked out and eliminated. The others were exploited to the point of total exhaustion. During the summer of 1944, the Nazis resorted to large-scale executions to liquidate more Jews. Russian prisoners of war were also exterminated at Auschwitz, as were Roma, homosexuals, disabled people and anti-Fascist resistance fighters. It was Auschwitz too that went on to supply living subjects for experimentation. An extension of the camp, located at Birkenau, was specially designated for the extermination of the Jews. The crematoria burned more than 20 000 corpses per day. It was there that the majority of Jews brought from Western Europe and the Balkans were eliminated. This was how the majority of Western European Jews would disappear, in particular almost three million Polish Jews. With them was annihilated a whole universe of traditions and culture, now lost for ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In all cases, this genocide is fundamentally connected with anti-Semitism and, more broadly, with Nazi racism. In particular, the Hitlerian vision of the world was of crucial importance, founded as it was upon the obsession with racial purity. From the start, Hitler’s racism contained the seeds of genocide. Alongside the Jews, other peoples, such as the Roma and the Slavs, were exposed to the murderous effects of this racism. For Hitler, they all deserved to die.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was in February 1940 that the deadly Zyclon B gas was tested on 250 Roma children, at which point the huge agony of hunger, cold, exhausting labour, diseases, brutality and pseudo-medical experiments began. A final 4 000 Roma were gassed and burned on 1 August 1944 in order to make way for further deportees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Will there never be an end to anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia? No doubt they will not disappear until all human families, faithful to their cultures and traditions, come together within a universal community. The Jews have suffered a lot and are still suffering. Minorities are often oppressed and suffer inordinately. To fight anti-Semitism and racism is not, therefore, to fight for the Jews or for minorities but to fight for humanity.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is not just a question of thinking about these events in terms of remembrance or even of education. As the resolution says, we must look at them not simply as historical events, but as a very real and present danger, which I believe they are. When political movements are not just extremist, and not based solely on certainty, but are also based on some feeling of their own superiority or their desire to be superior, that is an extremely dangerous mix for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, like others, welcome the moves by the Commission and the Luxembourg presidency to restart the negotiations on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia, because this is an issue that needs a political response.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that the resolution makes a point about the role of the media having a positive or a negative way of either engendering hatred or explaining difference in a positive way. When we look at the way in which some of the British media, for example, reported the plight of the Jews fleeing Hitler’s Germany and looking for sanctuary in the UK, we hear phrases like ‘we have enough’, ‘other people should be doing more’, ‘we should be sharing the burden’ as I suppose we would put it in modern parlance. A lot of that newspaper coverage was hostile: it vilified the Jews, and it actually treated them as sub-human. When we look at the way in which some of those same papers today have portrayed the Roma in the run-up to the accession of new Member States last year, and their remorseless targeting of asylum seekers, we know that those ideas have not gone away.</p>
      <p sl="en">Politicians also have a very clear leadership responsibility to promote understanding and a respect for different religions and races. This does not mean avoiding the difficulties, but if we are serious when we say ‘never again’ to the horrors of the Holocaust, we as politicians must stand up for strong anti-discrimination policies and confront racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and faith-based hatred, rather than bending our policies before it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution shows that we believe it is possible to make a positive future and that we in this House have the privilege and the possibility as politicians to help shape that future in a positive, constructive way.</p>

That is not the case; they were not present in the original text either.

On such days, we are called upon every year to honour the fights and the resistance of the millions of people whose every type of difference became a cause for their extermination. However, Auschwitz and Dachau must not remain a dead chapter in our history; on the contrary, they should, especially in our times, continue to remind us of the extent of the catastrophe which man alone can bring about, when he is carried away by ideological fanaticism, racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p sl="el">We owe it to those who were sacrificed and to those who will rise up and fight against all forms of expansionist policy and plans of imposition and world domination to keep this sad chapter in the history of mankind alive in our memory and minds.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to an amendment that I have tabled to the resolution. Today, Europe is laying the foundations to create a climate of greater peace and tolerance. Declaring 27 January Holocaust Memorial Day in order to encourage people to learn about it shows our clear determination to overcome and to fight all forms of intolerance and racism. It is a move to which I of course fully subscribe.</p>
      <p sl="it">When we think of Holocaust Memorial Day, however, we cannot and must not fail to remember and similarly condemn other holocausts, which are perhaps less well known but certainly no less serious in terms of the crimes committed against humanity. I therefore confirm my full, wholehearted support for the document under discussion, which deplores any kind of racism or xenophobia and, in general, any form of persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, and likewise condemns those events that represent one of the greatest horrors in all the history of humankind: the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is only right that Parliament should recall that, together with the Jews, other peoples and ethnic minorities who have been the victims of genocide and persecution must also not be forgotten, as unfortunately often happens. In my amendment, therefore, I have asked that the resolution should also mention the Armenians and the Kurds, the Italians slaughtered by Marshal Tito in Istria, and the millions of innocent people, among them Jews, who were exterminated in the Soviet gulags certainly in numbers no less vast than those killed by the German Nazis, as our Polish fellow Members have quite rightly pointed out.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate and an extremely important anniversary, upon which we are paying tribute to the millions of Jews, Poles and representatives of other nations who were killed in the German concentration camps. We must not forget that the flow of hatred they were swept away by cannot, unfortunately, be relegated to the past, as it continues to be a feature of modern-day life. Today we are faced with cases where lies are told and history is falsified, where the role of the concentration camps is belittled and their existence even denied, and where the Holocaust is minimised. We are also faced with cases where people talk about Polish, not German, concentration camps, which is particularly distressing given the large number of Polish victims of the Second World War. An example of this phenomenon can be found in the weekly supplement included this week with the Belgian newspaper le Soir. We should therefore fight for the historical truth and condemn any manifestation of anti-Semitism, as the latter is a moral disgrace for modern Europe and has been roundly condemned by the Polish Pope, John Paul II. It is an intellectual and moral embarrassment that we should still have to hear reports of its resurgence, particularly in Western Europe, but also in Eastern Europe. We should not quarrel over where this resurgence is taking place. The point is that it is happening. Wherever anti-Semitism surfaces, we should react decisively and consign it to the dustbin of history.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sorrowful anniversary will be commemorated tomorrow everywhere in Europe: the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, a symbol of all the camps built by the Nazis with the sole aim of carrying out the planned extermination of 11 million Jews then living in Europe. More than half were reduced to ashes. At a time when their ashes are still not cold, a number of people have, again recently, attempted to deny or relativise absolute barbarity. Sadly, two of them are Members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of honour for this Parliament to use this resolution against anti-Semitism – which, I hope, will be voted unanimously in favour of – to contribute to the fight against this scourge and also against all forms of xenophobia, racism and discrimination. It is a matter of honour for this Parliament to fight against all those who would falsify history. It is a matter of honour for this Parliament to pursue the politics of peace and unity that motivate us all by recommending that we never slacken our efforts in the unfailing service of education and tolerance and in teaching people about this black period of European and world history. At a time when, just about everywhere in Europe, violent anti-Semitism is resurfacing and various forms of intolerance are on the rise, we need to ask ourselves how we are to keep this memory alive in history when the surviving witnesses are no longer there. Our Parliament must thus encourage those Member States which have not yet done so to adopt legislative provisions along these lines, as a number of European countries have already done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This House is in the process of building a better future for future generations, with more freedom, more democracy, more tolerance and more mutual respect. Today, we are helping to ensure that no one ever forgets what human folly was capable of bringing about. Our support for this resolution will be a clear signal to our peoples, to our children, to future generations and to all those who fight for peace and human brotherhood.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today’s sitting of this House is a special one. It is taking place on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, and it is both a commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau by the Soviet Army and a tribute to the victims of the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I come from Poland, a country that witnessed the extermination of European Jews and Roma and the deaths and suffering of others under the military occupation of Nazi Germany. It is also a country that lost a large number of its elite and around three million of its Jewish citizens in the concentration camps. The Nazi authorities built extermination camps on occupied territory in Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, Majdanek and Chelmno, and these camps were where the genocide of Jews was carried out. Auschwitz has become a symbol of this crime, which is unparalleled in the entire history of humanity. My generation grew up in the shadow of the Second World War, which had been so disastrous for Poland, and in the shadow of the genocide that accompanied this war.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today I am speaking before the European Parliament, a symbol of an anti-fascist and anti-totalitarian Europe and of a Europe that has writ large the defence of human rights, as well as tolerance and democracy. The memory of the Holocaust must prompt us as Europeans, and also the European institutions, to take special duties upon ourselves as part of a global civilisation in the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Members of the Council, we are constantly being reminded of the existence of anti-Semitism, xenophobia and racism in Europe. We have to deal with the desecration of Jewish cemeteries and of Jewish ritual objects, and with displays of intolerance towards the Jewish community. Jews are regularly deprived of their right to Europe’s heritage, despite the fact that in historical terms they were one of the first groups to settle on the European continent. We have to deal with xenophobia and with openly racist acts against emigrants, as well as with religious and moral intolerance and with aggression against sexual minorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Does the Council not believe it to be appropriate for the European Union to set about creating a special education programme that prepares young people to create a European society based on multi-national, multi-cultural and multi-faith principles?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Other tasks await the European Union in the field of external policy. Does the Council anticipate stepping up the EU’s political activity and economic involvement in the Middle East, in order to make the European Union a guarantor of peace and democracy in the region? The European Union’s future priorities should include development policy, aid for developing countries and humanitarian aid. The Union is also called upon to take measures to promote human rights and democratisation in various parts of the world. It needs to respond appropriately in regions where genocide, murder or violence could occur against a background of prejudice for reasons of nationalism, religion, race, social class or traditions. Is the Council aware of these challenges? Is it aware of what is expected of the Union on the threshold of a new century?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Lega Nord will vote for this resolution. Just now, however, we heard a speaker associate with the subject of the Holocaust nothing less than patriotism, nationalism and the movements that take their inspiration from them, to the extent that she even called for national flags to be removed from the seats in Parliament, flags that represent the healthy feeling of patriotism in which we still believe.</p>
      <p sl="it">That demonstrates how it is possible to start from a reasonable premise but reach tyrannical conclusions that go against democracy. It is precisely for that reason that we are highly suspicious of this European directive, and we would remind the Commission representatives of the risk that it may be exploited for antidemocratic and illiberal purposes, as happened just now in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have also heard Islamophobia mentioned a great deal throughout the debate. I think it would be appropriate to ask ourselves what it is that Jews in Europe and across the world fear today, seeing that synagogues and Jewish centres, at least in the Italian and European cities that I visit, are under virtual military guard 24 hours a day. Let us ask ourselves who really constitute a threat today, spreading racist propaganda on television and carrying out physical threats and attacks. The important UN Assembly has been mentioned, but we must ask ourselves which countries’ seats were left empty. Let us remember, then, the Islamic peril and Islamic anti-Semitic racism, which this Parliament should have felt a moral duty to condemn out of respect for the victims.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when we are dealing with crimes as terrible as those which occurred in Auschwitz, we have a particular duty to offend no one when telling the truth, but to ensure that this historical warning continues to be heeded and viewed in the proper context and in proportion. Otherwise, we run the risk of relying on lies or even tragicomedy. The Auschwitz camp was built by Germany’s Nazi authorities on land they had occupied in Poland, a country that was attacked and divided up by the Third Reich and the USSR in September 1939. Although the camp’s first prisoners and victims were mainly Poles, it was later turned into an extermination camp for Jews so that the Third Reich could implement the ‘Final Solution’. As a result, over a million Jews were killed in Auschwitz, as well as around 75 000 Poles, around 20 000 Roma and tens of thousands of persons of other nationalities, including several dozen homosexuals. As has already been stated in this House, anti-Semitism was also prevalent in countries other than the Third Reich. The Nazi German state was, however, the only one to implement the plan to exterminate the Jews. Poles understand that contemporary Germans bear no responsibility for the crimes of their forefathers. They understand the Holocaust was an event that was unprecedented in history, and that the extermination of the Roma has often been sidelined. Yet what Poles do not understand, and what they will never agree to, is a belittling of their nation’s suffering during the Second World War. They will also never agree to the use of the phrases ‘Polish concentration camps’ or ‘death camps in Poland’. Political correctness on the issue of the Nazis’ nationality does not help to build the trust and reconciliation that Poles find particularly important. We should not be afraid to talk about these distressing facts as openly as Mr Fischer did during the recent debate at the UN, and as Mr Schulz did in this Chamber a short while ago. The life of every person is of equal worth, but when large numbers are at issue, placing the Jewish, Roma, homosexual and Polish victims on a par in a list borders on the absurd. Regardless of these painful considerations, however, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group believes that the memory of the enormity of the crimes committed in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp should be kept alive in order to ensure that this kind of genocide can never be repeated.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz is a moment of commemoration and reflection. The horror that greeted liberating forces in January 1945 is something that most of us have shared only through film footage and photographs. We cannot truly imagine the nature of the genocide that was perpetrated there and in the other death camps around Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Auschwitz is a stain on humanity and a symbol of evil beyond anything we can comprehend. Those of us who have visited it are overwhelmed by its desolation. One can still feel and taste the evil that was carried out there: the gas chambers, the huts crammed with young and old, the railway tracks that bore the death trains, the watchtowers, the crematoria, the pathetic personal remains of those millions who perished so horribly. Walking through the gates of Auschwitz is truly to walk through the gates of hell.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we stand with Jewish people across Europe and the world. We think of those who perished, we thank God for those who were liberated and we honour those alive today who survived the horror, including some in my own constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber. The Holocaust must never be allowed to slip from our collective memory. Neither, however, can we forget all those who have perished in genocidal atrocities throughout the world since World War II. Rwanda and Cambodia are but two examples of modern-day genocide that stir our emotions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Discrimination, prejudice and hatred continue to blight our world, and in this week of remembrance let us ensure that the failure of the world to prevent the Holocaust and Auschwitz serves as a warning to all of us who cherish liberty and freedom that we must never, ever forget.</p>

What we have to do here today is to separate the people from the groups – from the names we call them – because we are dealing with millions of individuals who died because they posed a threat to some ideology or because they were different.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this House we talk about fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights, yet all around us in the world today racism, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism still exist. Therefore, it does not matter what we say today; what matters is what we do. The Commission’s proposals will matter. It will matter whether it has the courage to bring forward non-discrimination on all the grounds of Article 13, and not just some. To do the latter would be to reinforce a hierarchy of oppression. We must all bear responsibility for what happened in the past – every nation, every country. But the difference is that we are either imprisoned by the past or we become guardians of the future to ensure that such inhumanities never occur again.</p>
      <p sl="en">Remember the people with disabilities, the trade unionists, the anti-fascists, the homosexuals and the millions of others mentioned here tonight who died. We must be determined that such a scenario never occurs again.</p>

When they came for the trade unionists, I was not a trade unionist, so I did not speak out. When they came for the queers, I was not a homosexual, so I did not speak out.

      <p sl="sk">An Eldorado of death and suffering, a exultant journey of hatred and a place where evil was wedded to evil. This was how my father described his pain when he visited Auschwitz. His family had died there. When visiting the freshly painted gas chambers, he could see how carefully dressed evil can give rise to hatred and a desire for revenge. Peace is not simply the absence of war. It is a state of justice, freedom, faith and conscience. Following the liberation of Auschwitz, however, peace and democracy did not come to all of the continent of Europe. Totalitarian regimes persisted, although in a different form. The eastern half of Europe lost the capacity for self-determination. We were locked within the boundaries of an empire of evil, which attempted to destroy our religious traditions, our recall of history and the very roots of our culture. Many were imprisoned simply because they invoked the freedom of conscience and religious freedom. My father was one of them. What does Auschwitz tell us today? That the willingness to forgive is a personal and free attitude which does not need repeating. No international treaty can heal the sadness. Without forgiveness, there can be no reconciliation. States cannot be reconciled unless their citizens forgive one another. In this respect, propaganda comes to mind, because propaganda is used by all totalitarian regimes. It is used to defend the politics of the elite and to prohibit alternative views under threat of death. It is no accident that enlightened European statesmen have wished to create a bond of unity among the different countries. This was the result of their own freedom of conscience and religious conviction. They understood that the good of humanity prevails over the good of each nation. These statesmen did not confuse national, cultural and legal heritage with the surrender of political sovereignty. Today’s Europe is still seeking its own future and meaning. We are still waiting for our peace, justice, freedom of faith, conscience and thought. Auschwitz is part of the European Union. Auschwitz and Strasbourg are definitively linked and will always remind us of the failures in our history. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a Yiddish saying, ‘Remember, and do not forget’. It is crucial for our fellow citizens to understand the uniqueness of the Holocaust, and we must be extremely vigilant faced with the resurgence of anti-Semitism. I am also a little surprised to see only the word ‘racism’ on the notice board, when the title of our colleague’s, Mr Schulz’s, oral question was in fact ‘Anti-Semitism and racism’. I am surprised that the title is not given in full.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The living memory of the generations of survivors will shortly die out. Hence, the need for the institutions to pass on the memory of the genocide to younger generations. I should like to submit a practical proposal to you. I suggest that the European Union require all schools to affix commemorative plaques to their walls, bearing the names of those former pupils who were deported and did not return. A ceremony in memory of these children could be organised on 27 January of each year. In the same way, I propose that plaques denouncing the collaboration that took place be placed outside police stations, law courts or regional administrative offices that issued deportation orders and whose officials were cowardly enough to allow the anti-Semitic barbarity to be perpetrated.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘never forget’ and ‘never again’ are the two historic phrases that we have in mind today as we commemorate, in just a few hours’ time, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. ‘Never forget’ was the injunction to us from those remnants of European Jewry who survived the murder by the Nazis and their accomplices. Tomorrow the ceremonies to which I have referred will show that we have not, thank God, forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can we be so sure, however, about the other injunction, ‘never again’? We see today the rising spectre of anti-Semitism in our continent and throughout the world. It sometimes takes a different form, but the ultra-nationalist, ultra-right who have always been anti-Semitic are sadly still there today in some of our countries: in Germany, in Russia, in France, and indeed, sadly, I have to accept that we also see it in my own country, Britain, which has the most honourable of records in fighting the Nazi tyranny and giving refuge to the persecuted. We see a new variant of the anti-Semitic virus in Islamic fundamentalism – not in Islam, as Islam has always been a friend to the Jewish people. Islamic fundamentalism is neither their friend, nor the friend of Western civilisation, nor the friend of any of our nations. We must ensure in the years to come that although we can have our differences about Middle East – and perhaps we should – those differences should never allow or permit verbal or physical violence against members of the Jewish communities of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. It is an honour for me to speak here, even though the Chamber is now half empty and we are only saved by the presence of the interpreters. Please allow me to get personal for a while, because I have the feeling that everyone wishes to count themselves as victims, but we do not wish to point a finger at anyone in particular as being the culprit and I think that the blame needs to be spread out before us. The Slovak state was one of the first satellite states of the Nazi Reich from which Jews were deported to the death camps. The deportation of Slovak Jews formed part of the process known by the Nazis as the ‘Final Solution’ for the Jewish question in Europe. The Final Solution sounds just as dreadful today. The case of the Slovak state is important from a historical standpoint, since it was a trial country for testing the Nazi strategy with respect to the Jews for subsequent application in other countries, and not only in the field of deportation. In fact, of fatal historical significance. Eighty-nine thousand Jews were deported from the Slovak state. Just a short trip into the history of ideologically motivated murder. I cannot omit to mention that the Slovak state was headed by a Catholic priest. The death camps saw the murder of Jews, Roma, antifascists of all nationalities and many others condemned to an absurd and vicious death. Has history taught us anything? Do we realise that the Holocaust has adopted the role of a universal symbol for all evil, representing, as it does, the most extreme form of genocide? Do we know what preceded this atrocity? Was it a word, or a sentence, which triggered the whole murderous machinery of hatred and outrage? I should like to ask you a question, Commissioner and Minister. In your view, is the defamation of a nation, an ethnic group, a race or a creed a punishable offence in the democratic world? Does the freedom of expression, as one of the basic democratic values, reach its limit when it becomes an instrument of such defamation of a nation, an ethnic group, etc? Do not the modern Nazis paradoxically hide behind hard-won democratic values and freedoms and should we not put a stop to them before these extremists in brown jack-boots come out onto the streets under the shield of democratic principles? We await your answer, Sir. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

We Hungarians must face the moral burden that at a time of crisis, we let German Nazis and Hungarian collaborators tear 550 000 Jewish fellow-countrymen from our nation, including the Hungarian poet and martyr, Miklós Radnóti, who describes the era in his poem ’Fragment’ as follows: ’I lived on this earth in an age / When man fell so low he killed with pleasure / And willingly, not merely under orders. / His life entangled, trapped, in wild obsession, / He trusted false gods, raving in delusion.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">Several monuments have been erected, documentation centres have been opened, and much has been published on the subject in Europe, but the most important monument to the Shoah should be within the hearts of all European citizens.

However, I can proudly report that we have designated a Holocaust Memorial Day, we have written coursebooks for students, and we finally opened the Holocaust Memorial Centre in Páva Street last spring. Moreover, although it came after a 60-year delay, the Hungarian Prime Minister has declared Hungarian collaborators accountable.</p>

We Hungarians would like to play a leading role in the European fight against discrimination, in protecting national, ethnic, religious, sexual and any other minorities, and in promoting the battle against discrimination. In addition to declarations and assertions condemning discrimination and hate speech, we need stable European legislation which can be universally enforced and which implements appropriate punitive sanctions. A working system is needed for the protection of minority rights within the Union, as this is our only way of protecting the minorities of Europe.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe that there is not a lot to add following a debate like this, which has been calm, honest from an historical point of view and often moving.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should simply like to say a word about the measures that need to be taken. I believe that we must now learn the appropriate lessons from this hideous experience of horror taken to the extreme. As the Presidency, we have been invited, together with the Commission, to resume work specifically on the proposal for a Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia. I believe we must do this, and I also think there are a lot of misunderstandings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Freedom of speech and thought are sometimes invoked with a certain amount of good faith but also a good dose of naivety. That is not, however, what is at issue in this case. I believe that the verbal hatred and racism for which anti-Semitism serves as a vehicle have nothing to do with freedom of speech, since we know – and history teaches us – that verbal hatred is often followed by physical hatred: that which hits out and causes injury directly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore believe that we must be consistent with ourselves and resume this work. We must also see how we can prohibit unworthy symbols that, for their part too, incite hatred and violence, since verbal violence becomes physical violence and aggression. It is an action that we must embark upon now, and I believe it would be a modest tribute to the memory of all those who we lost in the most terrible way. I believe that, if Parliament can go down this path in conjunction with ourselves, as the Presidency, and with the Member States, it will be possible for us to make a considerable contribution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I believe that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have this evening given important expression to what can and should be our relationship with the memory of the Holocaust. It is fair to say that remembrance can make our values stronger. As has been said, they are the values that inspired the founding fathers of our Europe and which we have a duty to preserve and strengthen.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Schulz recalled – and I share the idea deeply – how the founding fathers, such as Konrad Adenauer for the people of Germany, and let me also mention Alcide De Gasperi for the Italians, represented a new beginning after the tragedy of the dictatorship. They allowed us – I say this as an Italian – to walk with our heads held high in the new Europe. That is the great debt that we owe to the founding fathers.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been said that remembrance is a debt that we owe to the young. Europe today has the duty to honour that debt through education, schooling and training and, in a certain way, through a commitment to remember history while looking to the future. I personally like the proposal by some Members who think it would be good to have a European Holocaust Memorial Day that we can all commemorate together at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission, as Minister Schmit mentioned, is working closely with the Council to re-examine the framework decision against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. In that respect I fully agree with the assessment made by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission will soon be setting up a European agency to protect fundamental rights. To that end, I should like to reassure certain Members who have spoken that not only will such an agency not do away with our protection measures and safeguards against anti-Semitism and racism, but that it will in fact strengthen them. Respect for these principles and values will therefore remain central to the work done by the Agency, which the Commission will be setting up very soon with the Council’s agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, it seems that the ghosts – if I can call them that – of hatred and intolerance, violence and racism, are reappearing in Europe today. I believe that this Europe of ours must play a major role precisely in eradicating such negative values, particularly among the young, and in promoting tolerance and dialogue with other cultures and religions instead, for the sake of a principle already enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we have written into the European Constitution. That, I believe, is the best way to honour the victims of that tragedy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, I shall conclude this debate on a personal note. I remember how, as a schoolboy thirty years ago today, I saw a film entitled ‘Night and Fog’, which contributed a lot to my becoming committed politically. I did not imagine that, thirty years later, I would have the emotional task of chairing this debate. I believe that, on behalf of all my fellow MEPs, I can sincerely thank the Commission, the Council and all those men and women who have participated in this very high-quality debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Article 1 of the Grundgesetz, the German Constitution, reads, ‘Human dignity is inviolable’. That is a lesson learned from the crimes of the Nazi era and a mission statement for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the source and foundation of our legal order; it needs to be communicated to new generations of young people if they are to have an awareness of history and to be reminded of their historic responsibilities. Yet the makeup of our societies is changing: young people generally, and those from immigrant backgrounds to an increasing degree, lack any sense of personal connection. For that reason, there has to be a rethink of how history is communicated, particularly in schools; teacher training, as much as teaching materials and methods, have to be adapted to take account of this demographic change. Schools are crucial to the mutual understanding of cultures. Their potential must be made use of.</p>
      <p sl="de">What does give cause for concern is the rise in anti-Semitism in radical Muslim circles in Europe; as the EUMC’s 2003 study showed, this is particularly the case among young Arab Muslims, who are themselves potential victims of exclusion and racism. There is no excuse, though, for anti-Semitism of any kind, and so every effort must be made to involve young Muslims in society. Their social integration is of the greatest relevance if there is to be confident resistance to anti-Semitic attitudes in their own social environment.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Recommendation for Second Reading (A6-0002/2005) by Mr Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable [10458/4/2004 – C6-0140/2004 – 2004/0025(COD)].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-167" speaker_id="2278" name="Rübig" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I too have been deeply moved by the debate we have just had. What I have to say is that these things must be nipped in the bud. We often hear people expressing hatred of the European Union too, and of democracy in Europe, and I think we need to make a start soon on educating and informing them and making Europe’s people more aware of Europe’s values.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we attach particular importance to this ‘e-Content Plus’ programme, which is intended to get high-quality content onto global networks. Presenting Europe on global networks is something we see as having a strategic advantage in that global networks can be accessed directly and immediately and in that we can thereby exploit the opportunities offered in a worldwide context.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that our achieving, at second reading, funding for the programme to the tune of EUR 149 million for the period up to 2008 offers a considerable opportunity to make significant improvements to this European content on digital networks. We have also set aside EUR 55.6 million for the period up to the end of 2006.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, or so I believe, this programme has already shown its capacity for making us more competitive, thus acting in support of the Lisbon objectives, and we are now seeing a vast number of new jobs being created in the information and communication technology sector. If we want to create another 10 million jobs by 2010, ‘content’ must be a core element in the strategy for achieving the Lisbon criteria. We face the major challenge of putting Europe on the Net and focusing particular attention on it and its small and medium-sized enterprises. Agencies for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises have come into being, and they should also devise new business models for the digital content.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having seen the Internet hyped, we are now entering the next stage of its expansion, and this is where the Commission has done exemplary work. I would like to extend very warm thanks to all those who have played a part in this, because this, quite simply, gives us a chance to create global standards in which we can take a great deal of pride.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that the e-Content programme should be highly comprehensive – as we see from the Budget – in categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It should also have an impact on the European institutions. We should give thought to how we can better prepare our content and how we can bring it closer to the citizens, particularly in schools. Researchers should also be offered a broad range of linked virtual libraries, including rapid access to them via search engines. The latter exemplify the widest possible variety of highly interesting business models, with the possibility of new links and of very rapid access to the most important digital content in existence.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all know that scientific resources have developed a great deal over the years; one only needs to think of a library in an old monastery, in which people once compared the curative properties of camomile when applied to various parts of the body. A small example maybe, but it shows how science can derive great benefit from what has been learned in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we also have to consider telecommunications, looking at which licensing systems we can use in future, and at how we handle the granting of rights to use. It is here that it is becoming evident that micro-payments in the telecommunications sector offer models for refinancing or cofinancing. As we all know, what costs nothing is worth nothing, and it is for that reason that I regard as ideal the 50% cofinancing that the Commission has proposed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Being well-known as a campaigner for Europe’s small and medium-sized business structures, let me say that it is in the local sphere that we should give massive support to digital TV and the programmes that it offers. Packages of minimal size – I am thinking in terms of about EUR 100 000 each – but with a multiplicity of such programmes to prepare this European content in a professional way, are therefore likely to be particularly important in future. This could give rise to a degree of competition between those that are public and funded by fees and those in the private sector, which would be funded by incentives and are currently making massive advances in these modern sectors, as are the telecommunications companies that will in future also be providing this digital content through mobile telephones. These are quite new ways in which Europe could show that we are, quite simply, up there with the leaders.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where e-Government is concerned, the European Union – the Commission, Parliament, and the Council – should set an example. We need not only to have the very latest and most up-to-date hardware and software; I see ‘best practice’ as something that begins at home. We should show that there are governments in Europe that are perfectly capable of showing us, at European level, in what direction we could develop. In the area of e-health, there is much that we could do in terms of prevention and analysis. In the e-learning sphere, we can present a great deal of knowledge using ‘learning entertainment’, so that teachers in schools can at last have access to exciting and interesting materials.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is where, at European level in particular, we can support our 20 languages and Europe’s cultural diversity. The infrastructure that we will need in future will also enable us to see this Europe of ours in a new light. We need to be fascinated by Europe and to love it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to underline that only 12 months after its adoption by the Commission, we are now about to fulfil the conditions for a second-reading agreement on this important programme. This is rather unusual and that is why I wish to underline it. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and all the Members involved in the negotiations who made it possible to find an agreement with the Council while preserving the means for a proper functioning of this programme, in particular as far as the budget is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that the availability of content is one of the essential factors for the development of the new information society services. In the digital economy, content covers all types of information, text, images and sounds that can be transmitted by the networks. The eContent Plus Programme focuses on improving the conditions for innovation, notably in certain sectors of the digital content market. The online environment provides an ideal platform for innovative digital content products and services that transcend national boundaries. That is why this programme has a real European added value.</p>
      <p sl="en">Imagine that Europe had one digital content market, without barriers imposed or national and organisational boundaries – a market where all consumers would understand all the languages of the Union. It is likely that we would see many more maps, for example of trans-European roadways, waterways and other features, on the Internet. As the rapporteur has just underlined, we would see large European digital libraries of cultural and scholarly repute. We would see a greater abundance of European digital learning material, which our schools and teachers need. There would be a real cross-fertilisation between cultures and access to each other’s traditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is exactly what we want to achieve with the new programme. But we know that much remains to be done in order to overcome existing fragmentation and to allow businesses to develop innovative cross-border digital content products and services. Nevertheless, this is one of the rare programmes where SMEs are very much integrated. When I look at how the programme has been working so far, out of the 600 organisations participating in the funded projects, 241 participants are SMEs. So this programme is of benefit to those SMEs that show innovation and want to go in the direction of progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this programme we will focus only on those parts of the digital market where there is a clear fragmentation in Europe and where market forces alone cannot operate sufficiently well in driving growth. We are, therefore, targeting three domains: spatial or geographical data, educational material and cultural content. We will also give special attention to the linguistic diversity of the European Union, because we know that today’s information technologies can be made to work and to overcome the difficulties in combining formats and languages.</p>
      <p sl="en">This takes organisational effort, it takes experimenting at cross-border level, and that is exactly what eContent Plus will deal with. It will strengthen the conditions for a flourishing content market for the benefit of business, citizens and culture. That is also why the Commission is happy to accept the amendment tabled by the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Rübig, the debate we have just held on racism made an impression on me too, and I would like to thank the President for what he had to say on his own account. I am also grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for the excellent report he has produced, and above all for the prompt agreement on the EUR 149 million that this important programme certainly needs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us bear in mind that the overall market for digital content amounted to some EUR 515 000 000 as long ago as 2002. It is growing, and may it continue to do so, for it is part of our Lisbon Strategy, aimed at making Europe the most competitive of regions. That is also of course dependent on our overcoming the obstacles that exist in the EU on the grounds of the various languages, cultures, mentalities and – of course – traditions of administration. We also, of course, have market failures to deal with, and if we are to act to deal with all these things, we need to some degree financial help from the EU, in the shape of start-up funding to help us over these obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that we have to inject meaningful content into the infrastructures that already exist and those that are technically possible, such as third-generation mobile telephones; this will enable us to improve the lives of our citizens and, of course, also make them easier. Perhaps I might be allowed to draw attention to the implications of this for policy on the regions, the environment and transport. If we add meaningful content to a functioning market, it means that we can offer high-quality jobs to sparsely-populated regions – mountainous areas among them – and enable people to carry on living in them, so that they do not end up being depopulated. It also means that there will be less traffic in conurbations, and there are also positive effects in terms of the environment, in that fewer emissions and so on are produced.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, I very much welcome this programme and do of course hope that it will come to fruition as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I too would like to acknowledge what an interesting debate we have had on racism, but first and foremost I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, not only on this report, but also for his endeavours in the negotiations with the Council. I am very pleased that Parliament has been able to increase the level of funding from the initial EUR 135 million offered by the Council to what we are looking at now: EUR 149 million. It is particularly important that we have managed to secure, as the rapporteur stated, EUR 55.6 million before the end of this financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the rapporteur for the initial eContent report, I am very encouraged to see this sort of proposal on eContent Plus taking shape so quickly. Digital content in this era is one of the fastest growing areas. Without an equally rapid response from Europe we could continue to be left behind and we really have to maximise the opportunities arising in this area in order to challenge some of the dominance that the United States has managed to secure. With ever-rising private ownership, there is a lot more we could do, so I particularly welcome this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many opportunities for us to do more given the huge diversity of languages we have with 25 Member States. The eContent Plus Programme should now make a significant impact on all the media, as has been said by the Commissioner and others, in terms of books, public sector information and the media in general. But one of the problems we face within the EU is the variety of industries, from textiles to telecommunications, that are fragmenting our national markets. That variety faces us with even more challenges in terms of coordination and ensuring we remain competitive.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to ensure that we can guarantee safety of information for highway users because that is one of the issues. It impedes various people from using the Internet to its fullest and we need to do more to spread this culture of information. We need to do more to expand the EU websites, not just to give all EU citizens access to their representatives, but also to reduce their frustrations.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Rübig’s report is about improving digital content, one aspect of which is certainly increasing accessibility. Digital content must become as accessible as possible for people with disabilities. Visual disabilities spring to mind, for which speech technology or a Braille keyboard is available. This accessibility leaves something to be desired, because the technical characteristics of websites do not sufficiently correspond to the special equipment used by those people. Although W3C guidelines are in place for good website standards, the implementation of these guidelines is still very much lacking. The eContentPlus programme should contribute to the international harmonisation of accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. It is even financially lucrative for businesses to get involved. The development of the accessible applications may cost more, but the costs saved in maintenance and management make up for this in the financial result. This is a subject that very much deserves a place in the programme, all the more so because the objective of accessibility, more so than other objectives, requires international harmonisation. In my view, attention to accessibility for people with disabilities is important in helping me determine whether there is sufficient added value over and above national policy so that the increase in budget can be approved. Attention to people with specific needs should be fleshed out by integrating accessibility in the programme as a whole. Can I assume that the Commission intends to include accessibility requirements in the selection criteria and indicators for performance measuring? I should like to hear how strong an emphasis the Commission will place on accessibility for people with disabilities in terms of the relevant budget, because that should demonstrate whether the programme actually ensures that people with disabilities gain access to digital information and services, which certainly forms part of the European Union’s values and standards.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this joint decision by Parliament and the Council is a much-needed and eagerly-awaited new step towards a more widespread use of digital technologies and broadband information delivery. The developments we are seeing in the fields of applied mathematics and information technology are quite simply overwhelming, and they are accompanied by an equally rapid development of electronic technologies, particularly the reduction of size to a minimum whilst user functions are increased to a maximum.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All these developments are motivated by what I would call noble purposes, such as education, broadening access to culture and making administration and banking more efficient. In turn, this ought to promote the development of all scientific and technological disciplines, boost the economy and improve defence and security, including protection against terrorism. This should all be achievable by anyone who needs such access. I said ‘anyone’, but I must qualify this, as access and facilities of this kind must not under any circumstances be made available to criminals, including the various sorts of computer pirates. An effective way of stopping this group of potentially malicious users must be found.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also view this decision in the context of other documents, in particular the Parliament and Council decision on safer use of the Internet and online technologies. Yet we cannot on the one hand talk about convenience, and then on the other set our sights on introducing patents on computer programs. We would do better to search for a way of providing widespread and high-quality Internet access cheaply, for example via low-voltage electricity networks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It follows from what I have said that the draft decision should be seen as a constructive suggestion. I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, although unfortunately the amount set aside to implement this initiative falls far short of what is needed. The Council has proposed EUR 135 million, the rapporteur EUR 149 million and the Commission EUR 163 million. How does this square with the goals of the Lisbon strategy? How can such important goals be achieved for so little money?</p>

If it succeeds, it will lend support to the most fundamental component in the Lisbon Strategy. It cannot take effect too soon. I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Rübig, for his excellent work. We hope that the Commission will swiftly implement the changes accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The importance of the networked environment as a medium for knowledge and skills cannot increase unless there is essential, first-rate, reliable, comprehensive and safe content available. We, the Union’s legislators, have an obligation to ensure that all our citizens have high-quality European digital and information resources at their disposal. We recognise our cultural diversity and the growing needs of our citizens and the great opportunities that diversity offers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Multiculturalism can also be a source of wealth in the digital world. It is for that very reason that the digital world is a different, self-made, artificial, stimulating, deceptive and furiously powerful tool. That is why we know that European action is needed to safeguard diversity and quality. We also know that global market forces cannot offer services like it. That is why we know that pan-European content production is vital to enable us to progress from an information society to an educated one. We are a part of that public sector which has to produce digital services for civil society. Let us therefore attend to the matter of funding. I am therefore pleased with Mr Rübig’s amendments, in which the money available for the programme has been increased from the cuts made earlier on by the Council. For the digital world to be one that is common to all, everyone must be involved, regardless of social position. Democrats must not tolerate digital dictatorship, but that is another matter.</p>
